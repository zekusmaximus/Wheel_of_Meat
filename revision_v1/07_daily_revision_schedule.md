### Week 16: Reflective Elaboration + Final Dramatization (Days 110–112)

| Day | Task | Focus | Target |
|-----|------|-------|--------|
| 110 | **High-abstraction chapter pass**: Ch23, Ch24, Ch25, Ch26. Cut 30-40% of "told" passages. Replace with sensory grounding. NET-0. | Final sequence | 30-40% reduction |
| 111 | **Final dramatization verification**: Confirm (1) Devaka's betrayal dramatized, (2) Stewart rooftop fall expanded, (3) Lilith's first intervention shown. All NET-0. | Ch4, Ch5, Ch22 | 3+ scenes verified |
| 112 | **Final compile + acceptance tests**: Run full analyzer. Run all C1–C7 tests. Prepare manuscript for submission. | All | All gates PASS |

**📊 Final Gate G8 (End Week 16)**:

| Constraint | Target | Verification |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| C1: Total words | 125,000 (110,000–130,000) | PASS |
| C2: Net cut | 91,594 (80,000–100,000) | PASS |
| C3: Incarnations cut | 4 (3–4) | PASS |
| C4: Manchester % | 40.00% (40–50%) | PASS |
| C5: Pivotal scenes | 3+ (≥3) | MANUAL VERIFY |
| C6: Reflective reduction | 30-40% | MANUAL VERIFY |
| C7: Tic density | ≤50% baseline | PASS |

## Safety Rails: Avoiding Over-Cutting or Under-Cutting

> [!CAUTION]
> **If your running total drops below 105,000 words at ANY point before Week 14**: STOP compressing. You have over-cut. Review recent cuts and restore essential content.

> [!CAUTION]
> **If your running total is above 135,000 words at the end of Week 12**: You are behind on compression. Add an extra compression pass to high-word-count chapters.

> [!TIP]
> **Manchester expansion is your pressure valve.** If you've over-compressed historical content, you can add slightly more to Manchester chapters (up to 52,000 total) without violating C4 (50% cap). If you've under-compressed, Manchester can be trimmed to 48,000 minimum (40% floor).

## Verification Checkpoints

Run these after each phase:

```bash
# Generate fresh analysis
python3 tools/revision_audit/manuscript_analyzer.py

# Check total words
jq '.total_words' out/revision_audit/analysis_data.json

# Check chapter count
jq '.chapters | length' out/revision_audit/analysis_data.json

# Check Manchester percentage
jq '[.chapters[] | select(.type == "Manchester") | .word_count] | add' out/revision_audit/analysis_data.json
```
