Heat arrived before image, before sound, before the shape of the consciousness she was following. Different from fire-heat, from the clean warmth of flame or the body-knowledge of prehistoric survival. Something wet. Something wrong.

Lilith's flat held its after-midnight silence. The radiator ticked its inadequate rhythm against the December cold. Rain traced the window in patterns she had stopped watching days ago. But beneath her palms wrapped around ceramic gone cold a different temperature was bleeding through.

Fever.

The thread she followed had shifted. Chandra's administrative precision had receded like a tide, leaving deposits she had not fully examined: the satisfaction of intervention, the backfire she had not yet named as backfire, the hunger that dressed itself as strategy. And now another thread surfaced—different in texture, different in weight, dense with a heat that had nothing to do with calculation.

She closed her eyes. The flat disappeared, became peripheral, became body-echo.

Athens materialized through sensation before it took visual form. The heat was everywhere. Not summer heat, not fire heat, but the burning that came from inside bodies that were failing. She could feel it radiating from skin that should not feel so hot, pressing against palms that she recognized as her own and not her own.

*Philon.*

The name surfaced with context Chandra's ledgers could never have held. A physician in a city that was eating itself. A man whose hands could not stop reaching for flesh that was dying under his touch.

She felt what his hands felt before she understood it.

Rough-smooth. Raised texture against fingertips. Heat radiating through thin skin, through the porousness of flesh beginning to fail. The sensation translated across epochs as pressure against her own palms—something there that should not be there, something growing beneath the surface.

Pustules.

The word arrived clinical and distant. The sensation was neither.

She pressed closer to the thread, and the smell came with proximity. Not clean illness, not the sharp tang of fever-sweat she had known in other lives. This was different. Sweet and thick and layered, the smell of meat that was rotting while still breathing, of bodies stacked in doorways waiting for fires that could not burn fast enough, of a city drowning in its own dying.

Her flat smelled of nothing. She had arranged it that way, sterile, unlived-in, a space that did not demand attention. But Athens smelled of everything at once, and the contrast registered as wrongness, as absence-made-presence, as the ghost of smoke she could not quite breathe.

The thread hummed with a different frequency than Chandra's careful ledgers. This consciousness lived in its hands. Hands that reached without calculating, that touched without weighing cost against benefit, that could not stop offering even when the offering was killing him.

But something was different. Something had shifted from the patterns before.

She traced the evidence of what had accumulated. In his clinic, he had trained the young man Alexios—had asked what he noticed, valued insight his own attention had missed. The cooperation that had taken root in the earliest patterns remained intact, woven into behavior without conscious effort. He did not retreat to isolation when pressure mounted. He worked within networks, shared knowledge, relied on others' eyes.

And when his hands touched dying flesh, there was no ledger-distance, no careful measurement of investment against return. He stayed. He witnessed. He gave himself, not just treatment.

Two lessons, integrated into behavior before she could observe him struggling.

The thought should have been clinical. Instead, something shifted in her chest—a wrongness she filed without examining. Progress visible. Progress undeniable. Progress that made her intervention with Chandra look like acceleration rather than impediment.

She recognized the pattern beneath the progress. Not from Chandra's ledgers. Not from Ka's isolation. Something newer. Purer.

This consciousness could not stop reaching. His hands on the dying were not calculation but compulsion—service that had become indistinguishable from self-destruction. A different flaw wearing a familiar face. The ego hiding inside virtue's clothing.

*I see what went wrong.*

The thought formed with the clarity of analysis, but it rang hollow now. Chandra's lesson had crystallized despite her intervention. She had accelerated rather than corrupted, had sharpened rather than dulled. And if the pattern held—

She stopped the thought. Filed it. Returned to the thread.

*I'll correct.*

The flat reasserted itself around her, cold tea, ticking radiator, the silence of a space no one visited. But beneath it, Athens continued: the heat, the smell, the texture of pustules under a physician's hands that would not stop reaching.

She leaned into the thread. The correction began.
