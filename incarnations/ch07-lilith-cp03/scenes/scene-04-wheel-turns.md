The slave woman died three hours before dawn.

Lilith felt the moment as a loosening—not in herself, but in the thread, in the tension that had held the woman's consciousness to failing flesh. Philon sat beside the body in the darkness of his small room, his hands still on skin that was already cooling, and the fever's heat finally released into the air where it would find new hosts, new bodies, new meat to consume.

The pustules on the woman's arms would never heal. They would never scar. They remained frozen in their final swelling—rough-smooth texture that Lilith could still feel against her own palms, phantom sensation from a body she had never touched.

*Why you?* The woman had asked in the hours before the end. *Why waste on one slave?*

Philon had given her no answer. The absence echoed across centuries, across the thread, into the flat where Lilith sat with her hands around cold ceramic and her awareness pressed against a death that had already happened.

He closed the woman's eyes. The gesture was gentle—physician's hands performing the last service they could offer. She had never told him her name. He had never asked.

The thread shifted.

Philon coughed.

The sound arrived in Lilith's awareness with the weight of inevitability—dry at first, then deeper, the rattle of lungs beginning to fill with what should not be there. She felt the heat building behind his eyes as if it were building behind her own, the fever announcing itself in that first wrong breath.

He understood. She felt the understanding crystallize in his consciousness: he was meat now. Meat that was failing. Meat that would burn.

The next three days compressed into sensation.

*His hands reaching for the water basin. The weight defeating him—twenty pounds, perhaps less, suddenly impossible. The tremor in fingers that had sutured wounds and mixed tinctures and pressed against ten thousand fevered foreheads.*

Lilith's own hands trembled against the mug. Her body registered what his body was experiencing—not pain, not illness, but the shadow of it, the echo, the texture of mortality she had transcended but could not ignore.

*The pallets around him emptying. The patients who had been recovering now carrying him to the bed he had occupied for twenty years. Their hands on his fevered skin, uncertain, unpracticed at receiving care.*

She felt the heat spike. The delirium beginning. The thread growing thin and strange as his consciousness loosened from the flesh that had carried it.

*The woman from Scythia appeared in his fever-dreams. She stood at the foot of his pallet with her pustules frozen in their final swelling, her dark eyes no longer glassy with fever but clear—too clear—and she asked the question again.*

"*Why you? Why waste on one slave?*"

And beneath her voice, another question, rising from the depths of his dissolving certainty:

*Was the one for them—or for me?*

The thought burned brighter than the fever. Lilith felt it crystallize in the thread—not an answer, but a seed. The question that would not resolve, that could not resolve, that would carry forward into whatever came next.

*It was not virtue,* Philon understood, too late. *It was fear wearing virtue's face. I could not bear to be the man who closed the door—so I became the man who died instead.*

The realization offered no comfort. It only hurt—a final bright pain that would not resolve into peace.

They found him in the evening.

Two citizens with cloths pressed to their mouths, tasked with clearing the abandoned clinics. They recognized his tools more than his face—the bronze scalpel beside his pallet, the clay jar of willow bark, the meticulous organization of implements even in extremis. The physician who had treated anyone. The physician who had refused no one. The physician who had stayed too long.

They wrapped his body in the sheet from his pallet. No coins for the ferryman. No washing, no anointing, no prayers that had not already worn hollow through overuse. They carried him through streets lined with the dying and the dead, past temples where gods looked on in marble silence.

They placed him on a pyre with eleven others.

The fire, when it came, was ordinary. Wood and oil and the particular smell of burning that had become Athens's atmosphere. Philon's body gave up what little remained—meat among meat, anonymous, one more physician who had reached too far and burned for it.

The wheel of meat turned.

Lilith surfaced.

The flat reasserted itself around her—ticking radiator, rain against windows, the ceramic mug she had been holding gone cold hours ago. Her hands ached where they had gripped too long. Her body felt foreign, as if she had been wearing someone else's dying.

*We are the same.*

The thought did not frighten her. It interested her now—two iterations, three iterations, the same pattern repeating. Ka hoarding meat against the cold. Chandra hoarding ledgers against uncertainty. Philon reaching for one more patient until reaching became dying.

And her?

She felt the kinship-whisper extending from Ka through Chandra to Philon, felt the pattern she was mapping grow denser with data.

*Curiosity,* she named the feeling. *Understanding.*

She did not ask what she was hoarding. She did not examine the thread she could not release, the tracking she could not stop, the certainty she held like frozen meat in a cave no one else could find.

*I see what went wrong.*

Athens still burned in her awareness—pyres and smoke, the question that had crystallized too late to save him. She had isolated him perfectly. She had accelerated his martyrdom precisely. But the lesson had not corrupted. The seed remained viable, carrying forward into whatever came next.

*I'll correct.*

The thread hummed forward, already shifting toward the next consciousness, the next iteration, the next life she would track. Rome waited—an investigator, a procedural mind, a man who trusted evidence.

Lilith leaned into the new thread. Her hands remained cold around cold ceramic. The flat held its chosen silence.

The wheel turned, and she turned with it, and neither of them understood that turning was also reaching.
