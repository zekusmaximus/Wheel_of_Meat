The intervention required two pressures.

The first was simple—panic breeding panic, the spread of fear through bodies packed too close. The Long Walls had filled with refugees from the countryside, families fleeing Spartan raids who crowded together in canvas shelters and shared air and shared dying. Lilith pressed against the fear-threads and felt them brighten.

*Persian ships,* the whisper moved through the city. *Poison in the water. Disease from the east.*

She did not create the words. She only weighted the probability of their spreading. In her flat, the sensation registered as tightening—bodies pressing closer, breath coming harder, the suffocating density of souls packed into spaces that could not hold them. The panic tasted of copper and bile. She swallowed against it, though her mouth held nothing but cold air.

The rumor would isolate Philon. Metics turned away from fountains; physicians with foreign-trained hands viewed with suspicion. The city was eating its own.

The second pressure required intimacy.

She found Alexios in the hour before dawn, when sleep ran deepest and dreams spoke loudest. The young man slept in a modest room near the Agora—alone now, though once this bed had held another. His consciousness hummed with exhaustion and suppressed grief and the rawness of loyalty still unsure which way to break.

Lilith pressed in.

A gesture subtler than possession or control—the brush of attention against sleeping awareness, the weight of suggestion laid along fear-threads already vibrating. She did not take his dream. She shaped it.

*Look,* she whispered without words. *See what is coming.*

The pyre materialized in his sleeping mind.

Athens burned behind it—not with the clean fire of hearth or forge, but with the greasy smoke of human fat rendering, of flesh becoming fuel. The bodies stacked like cordwood were faceless, anonymous, meat piled for burning. But the body at the center of Alexios's vision was neither faceless nor anonymous.

Philon lay on the pyre with his eyes still open.

Lilith felt Alexios's dream-body flinch, the visceral recoil of recognition. She held the image steady—not cruel, not lingering, only *clear*. This was what waited. This was what the physician's hands were reaching toward with every patient they touched.

She made him see the details.

The way the skin had mottled. The pustules frozen in their final swelling, never to heal, never to scar. The flesh loose on bones that had starved themselves feeding others. The mouth slack where words of comfort had lived, now silent, now meat.

She made him smell it.

The sweet-rot of bodies left too long. The sharper char of fat crackling in flame. The mineral tang of blood dried on stone. The smoke that would rise and spread and become Athens's atmosphere for months to come.

*This is where compassion ends,* she whispered at the edge of his dream. *This is what the hands that cannot stop reaching become.*

Alexios's dream-self reached toward the pyre—toward his teacher, toward the man who had shown him what a physician could be. His fingers met heat. His flesh met memory.

*You cannot serve the dead.*

She pressed the words into the soft tissue of his sleeping fear, into the place where choices lived before the waking mind could analyze them.

*Survival is service. The living need physicians more than the dying need witnesses.*

The logic was sound. The logic was what he already half-believed. She only weighted the probability of belief becoming certainty.

*Eleusis has physicians. Eleusis has work that needs doing. The road is passable if you leave within the day.*

The dream shifted. Philon's body on the pyre became ash, became smoke, became the gray that would color the sky for months. Alexios watched it rise—his teacher becoming air, becoming nothing, becoming the lesson he would carry.

*Remember the smell,* Lilith whispered. *Remember it every time you look at him.*

She withdrew.

The young man gasped awake in his modest room near the Agora, his heart pounding, the taste of ash on his tongue. Lilith felt his waking consciousness slam into the memory of fire, of flesh, of his mentor's face becoming meat on a pyre.

The smell did not leave him. She had made certain of that.

In her flat, the intervention settled into something that felt like satisfaction—but thicker, heavier, a warmth in her chest that had nothing to do with the radiator's inadequate clicking. Her tea had gone cold again. The rain had shifted against the windows.

She did not examine the warmth.

Alexios would look at Philon today and see the pyre waiting behind the living face. He would remember the smell of burning. He would make his choice—the choice she had weighted, the choice that would leave the physician alone when the slave woman collapsed at the gate.

*This intervention will work differently,* she told herself. *More precise. More isolated.*

The hunger in her chest did not name itself. She did not ask it to.
