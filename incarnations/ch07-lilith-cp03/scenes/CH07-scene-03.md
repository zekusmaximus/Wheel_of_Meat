Alexios left at midday. Lilith watched him go through the thread. Heard his footsteps receding down streets emptied by fear, his face set with the certainty of a man who has made peace with abandonment.

The dream had worked. The smell of burning clung to him still.

Only Philon remained, alone in his clinic, surrounded by the dying he could not stop touching.

She leaned closer.

---

The slave woman collapsed at the eastern gate three days after Alexios fled.

Lilith felt the impact before she understood it. Knees striking stone, the sound of a body surrendering to weight it could no longer carry. The guards had retreated to a distance that spears could not cross. No one moved toward the fallen woman. No one spoke her name.

She had no name. Not anymore. Whatever her owners had called her had been left behind when they fled the fever, when they threw their property to the streets like spoiled grain.

Philon heard the commotion from his clinic. The thread hummed with his attention shifting—away from the patients who might live, toward the woman who would certainly die.

*Don't,* Lilith thought, though the word carried no power. She was observing now, not intervening. The isolation she had engineered was meant to create despair, yet here was reaching toward a dying woman no one else would touch.

He went anyway.

The guards parted for him. The crowd parted. The empty space around the fallen woman opened like a wound, and Philon walked into it with his bag slung across his shoulder and his hands already reaching.

Lilith felt what he felt when his fingers touched dying flesh.

Heat. Fever-heat that radiated through skin papery with dehydration, through the thin membrane between life and what came after. The woman's forehead burned against his palm hot as fired clay, hot enough to feel through the calluses he had earned in twenty years of practice.

*Help me.*

The words did not travel across epochs. They did not need to. The woman's eyes found Philon's face, and the plea in them was older than language.

He knelt beside her.

Lilith's own knees pressed against something. The worn fabric of her armchair, the give of cushioning she had stopped noticing years ago. The sensation doubled: stone beneath his legs, fabric beneath hers. Cold tea in her hands, fever-skin beneath his fingertips.

The parallel crystallized.

*Philon reached for the dying woman. Lilith reached for the thread.*

The same gesture. The same compulsion. The same inability to stop, to weigh cost against benefit, to calculate whether this one was worth the hundred waiting behind.

"Bring water," Philon said to the crowd that would not approach. "And a litter. She needs shade and rest."

The words carried across the empty space—futile, necessary, the speech of a man who did not know how to stop trying.

*We are the same,* Lilith thought. Her hands had stilled on the mug.

The observation arrived without alarm, without the horror that had accompanied it the first time with Ka. This was data now. Pattern recognition accumulated across enough iterations to become signal rather than noise.

Three times she had found herself in the thread. Ka hoarding in his cave, unable to release meat to the tribe. Chandra calculating in her ledgers, unable to release resources without measuring return. Philon reaching for one more patient, unable to stop offering what would cost him everything.

Different faces. Same compulsion. Same inability to release.

Her own hands—cold around ceramic gone cold—were performing the same gesture.

She understood his mistake with perfect clarity. He was conflating service with sacrifice, obligation with obsession. He would die reaching for one more patient—not because he had failed to learn cooperation (he had trained Alexios, shared knowledge, worked within networks without retreat to isolation), not because he maintained distance (he touched dying flesh, stayed present with suffering, gave himself and not just treatment).

No. His mistake was newer. Purer. The ego hiding inside virtue's clothing.

*Was the one for them—or for me?*

The question was already forming in the thread, waiting to crystallize. She could feel its shape—the insight his dying would release, the lesson her intervention had not corrupted but concentrated.

Two patterns corrected. A third emerging. And beneath her clinical observation, something else stirred—a wrongness she filed without examining.

She saw his mistake. She documented it. She filed it with the pattern she was mapping.

Her own hands around ceramic gone cold were performing the same gesture. Reaching. Holding. Unable to release.

She failed to see it.

The slave woman's weight settled against Philon's chest. Too light, the fever having consumed whatever substance she once held. He carried her toward his clinic, toward the small room where he would tend her until one of them stopped breathing.

Lilith watched.

The thread hummed with his compulsion, and she followed it, and neither of them understood that following was also reaching.
