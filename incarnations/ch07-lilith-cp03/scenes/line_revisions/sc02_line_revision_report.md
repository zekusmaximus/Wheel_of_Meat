# Editorial Review: The Dream-Walker

## Scene: `CH07-scene-02.md`

---

## Executive Summary

This 70-line scene is technically clean (zero punctuation issues) but loaded gesture at 25.7% needs attention. The dream-sending intervention is choreographed with precision. The pyre imagery is powerful but could use more grounding in Lilith's body. **Overall revision priority: Moderate**.

### HIGH-Priority Flag

## 3. Voice Pattern Compliance

| Pattern | Target | Actual | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Sensory Anchoring | 75% | ~70% | ✓ PASS |
| Loaded Gesture | 40% | **25.7%** | ⚠ BELOW |
| Environmental Metaphor | 50% | ~50% | ✓ PASS |
| Parallel Construction | 20% | ~30% | ✓ PASS |

### Loaded Gesture Analysis

**Present:**
- L7: "the sensation registered as tightening—bodies pressing closer"
- L57: "his heart pounding, the taste of ash on his tongue"
- L61: "a warmth in her chest that had nothing to do with the radiator's inadequate clicking"

**Missing opportunities (Lilith during dream-sending):**
- L17-19: "She pressed in... She did not take his dream"—no body reaction
- L27-31: Describing pyre details—Lilith's body absent
- L37-43: Whispering at edge of dream—no physical cost

### Suggested Enhancement (L27):

**Current:**
> "Lilith felt Alexios's dream-body flinch, the visceral recoil of recognition. She held the image steady..."

**Revised:**
> "Lilith felt Alexios's dream-body flinch, the visceral recoil of recognition. Her own jaw tightened. She held the image steady..."

## 4. Priority Line Revisions

### LINE 31: Pyre Detail (Preserve)

**Current:**
> "The way the skin had mottled. The pustules frozen in their final swelling, never to heal, never to scar. The flesh loose on bones..."

**Assessment:** Gruesome precision. Fragment structure works for catalog effect. **Do not alter.**

---

### LINE 37: Intervention Whisper (Preserve core)

**Current:**
> "*This is where compassion ends,* she whispered at the edge of his dream. *This is what the hands that cannot stop reaching become.*"

**Assessment:** Key thematic beat—compassion as destruction. Perfect. **Do not alter content**, but consider adding physical cost after.

---

### LINE 69: Hunger Beat (Preserve)

**Current:**
> "The hunger in her chest did not name itself. She did not ask it to."

**Assessment:** Critical fetter progression. **Do not alter.**

- "The hunger in her chest did not name itself"
