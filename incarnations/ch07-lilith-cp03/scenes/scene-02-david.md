# Chapter 7, Scene II: The Good Son

-----

The therapy room held its usual neutrality—beige walls, gray carpet, the inoffensive watercolor prints that someone had chosen precisely because they could not offend. April light fell through blinds adjusted to discourage direct sun, striping the room with shadow. The radiator had been cycling irregularly all morning, filling the space with warmth that arrived in unpredictable waves.

David Mercer sat in the client chair with his hands resting on his knees, palms down, as if pressing against something that might otherwise lift him from his seat. Late forties, perhaps early fifties—the age difficult to read beneath exhaustion that had settled into his features like sediment. His shirt was pressed but not fresh, the collar showing the slight discoloration of something worn too many days running. His wedding ring was gone, though the indentation remained.

"How was this week?" Lilith asked.

"The same." His voice carried the hoarse quality of someone who had stopped expecting things to be different. "Marsha had a bad night on Tuesday. I didn't sleep. Work sent another email about my performance review. I'll deal with it."

"Will you?"

He looked up, something flickering in his eyes—not quite irritation, but its cousin. "I always deal with it. That's what I do."

The radiator clicked and settled. Lilith let the silence stretch, watching the way he held himself: shoulders slightly hunched, weight forward, the posture of someone carrying more than he could comfortably lift.

"Tell me about the bad night."

"She woke at three. Didn't know where she was, didn't know who I was. Called me by my father's name for an hour before the medication started working again." David's hands had curled into loose fists on his knees. "By the time she settled, it was five. I had to be at work at eight."

"Where was the night nurse?"

"I cancelled the night nurse." The admission came flat, without defensiveness. "Three weeks ago. She wasn't doing it right."

"Doing what right?"

"Any of it. The way she positioned Marsha for sleep. The tone she used when Marsha got confused. The—" He stopped, jaw working. "I can do it better myself."

"And the cost of that?"

"There's no cost." His voice had sharpened. "This is what you do for family. This is what a good son does."

Lilith held very still. The phrase hung in the room between them, weighted with more than its surface meaning. *A good son.* She had heard variations of it from a dozen patients—the script they followed, the story they told themselves about what love required.

"Your marriage ended two years ago," she said. "Your wife asked for the divorce after Marsha moved in."

"She couldn't handle it."

"What couldn't she handle?"

David's hands unclenched, then clenched again. "The way everything changed. The way our life became about Marsha's schedule, Marsha's medications, Marsha's needs. She said I'd disappeared. That she felt like she was living with a ghost who only showed up to take care of his mother."

"Was she wrong?"

The question landed harder than Lilith had intended. David flinched, a small contraction of his shoulders that he tried to cover by shifting in his chair.

"She wasn't wrong," he said finally. "She just didn't understand why it had to be that way."

"Why did it have to be that way?"

"Because no one else was going to do it." The words came quick now, practiced from repetition. "My brother lives in Leeds. He has kids, a job, a life. He visits every other month, stays for a weekend, plays the concerned son, and then he's gone. I'm the one who stayed. I'm the one who shows up every day. I'm the one who—"

He stopped. His eyes had gone wet, though no tears fell.

"Who what?"

"Who proves that I'm not like him." The admission emerged like something being extracted. "My father. He left when we were kids. Just walked out one day, didn't look back. Marsha raised us alone, worked two jobs, sacrificed everything. And I promised myself—I was twelve years old, and I promised myself that I would never be the person who abandoned her."

The room settled into stillness around the confession. Lilith could feel the shape of it now: not just caregiving but compensation, not just love but proof of worth, the architecture of identity built on a foundation of not-being-like.

"So when you cancel the night nurse because she's not doing it right—"

"I'm doing what my father wouldn't."

"And when your marriage ends because your wife feels like she's living with a ghost—"

"I'm proving that I can be counted on."

David's hands had gone still on his knees. He was looking at her with something that might have been recognition or might have been horror—the expression of someone catching sight of themselves in an unexpected mirror.

"What would it mean," Lilith asked, "to accept help?"

"That I'm not enough. That I can't do what I promised to do."

"What did you promise, exactly?"

"To be there for her. To never abandon her."

"And hiring a night nurse three nights a week would be abandonment?"

The question opened something in the space between them. David's breath caught, released, caught again.

"When you say it like that, it sounds—"

"Say it however you want. I'm asking the question."

He was quiet for a long moment. The radiator cycled on, filling the room with sudden warmth. Outside, Lilith could hear the distant murmur of traffic, the ordinary sounds of a world continuing regardless of what happened in this small beige room.

"My worth doesn't depend on being the only one who helps her." David spoke slowly, testing each word. "That's what you're trying to get me to see. That I've built this—this identity around being indispensable, and the identity is killing me."

"Is it?"

"I haven't seen friends in eight months. I turned down a promotion because it would have required travel. I eat standing up in the kitchen at eleven p.m. because I forgot to eat dinner." He pressed his palms flat against his knees, steadying himself. "I'm fifty-one years old, and the only person who touches me is my mother when she doesn't know who I am."

Lilith let the words settle. There was pain in them, but also something else—the first crack in a structure that had been maintained through sheer force of will.

"Who taught you that love looks like this?" she asked.

"What do you mean?"

"The total sacrifice. The disappearance of yourself. The measuring of devotion by how much it costs." She leaned forward slightly. "Is this what Marsha modeled for you? Or is this what you decided love should look like because it's the opposite of what your father did?"

David's face shifted—not quite crumbling, but restructuring, the features rearranging themselves around something that had not been visible before.

"Both," he said. "Neither. I don't know."

"Consider the possibility," Lilith said, "that there's a version of being a good son that doesn't require you to disappear. That sustainable care includes caring for yourself. That your mother might actually want you to have a life, even if she can't always remember who you are."

"She sacrificed everything for us."

"She did. And now you're sacrificing everything for her. And when you're gone—worn out, burnt out, dead of a heart attack at sixty—who takes care of her then?"

The question landed with visible impact. David's eyes went wide, then narrowed, then went somewhere else entirely—inward, calculating, reassessing.

"I never thought of it that way."

"Most people don't. They're too busy proving something to think about what happens when the proof is finished."

The session's time was ending. Lilith could feel it in the room's energy, the slight shift that signaled transition. David sat with his hands still pressed flat against his knees, but something had changed in his posture—the hunched quality less pronounced, the forward lean more like attention than burden.

"Same time next week?" she asked.

"Yeah." He stood, then paused at the door. "That thing you said. About sustainable care."

"What about it?"

"Do you believe it? I mean—do you actually apply it to yourself, or just to patients?"

The question caught her mid-breath. She let it settle before answering.

"I work at it."

He nodded, accepting the partial truth, and let himself out.

-----

The room held its silence after he left. Lilith remained in her chair for a long moment, cataloguing the session's residue: the particular weight of David's confession, the shape of his patterns becoming visible, the question he had asked at the end.

*Do you actually apply it to yourself?*

She thought of the notebooks in her flat. The tracking sessions that stretched into early morning hours. The thread she was following through time, the pattern she was learning to shape, the work she called work because calling it obsession would require examination.

*That's different,* she told herself. *That's purpose. That's understanding something that needs to be understood.*

Her phone buzzed: a text from her mother. *Jeff and I would love to have you for dinner this weekend. Saturday at 7?*

She typed back: *I'd like that. Can I bring anything?*

The response came almost immediately: *Just yourself. So looking forward to you meeting him properly.*

Lilith set the phone down. The radiator had cycled off, leaving the room to settle into its neutral temperature. In three hours she would see her next patient—a graduate student with test anxiety, manageable and contained. In five hours she would be home, making dinner, reviewing notes, preparing for tomorrow's clinical work.

And later, when the day had finished its ordinary unfolding, there would be the corner of the flat where the lamp waited. The notebooks. The thread she was following, pulling her forward into whatever understanding awaited.

But that was later. For now, there were notes to write. A session to document. The accumulated small work of a career that continued regardless of what else she pursued in the quiet hours.

She reached for her pen and began to write.
