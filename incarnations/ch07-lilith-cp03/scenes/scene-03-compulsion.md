Alexios left at midday. Lilith watched him go through the thread—his footsteps receding down streets emptied by fear, his face set with the particular certainty of a man who has made peace with abandonment.

The dream had worked. The smell of burning clung to him still.

Now there was only Philon, alone in his clinic, surrounded by the dying he could not stop touching.

She leaned closer.

The slave woman collapsed at the eastern gate three days after Alexios fled.

Lilith felt the impact before she understood it—knees striking stone, the particular sound of a body surrendering to weight it could no longer carry. The guards had retreated to a distance that spears could not cross. No one moved toward the fallen woman. No one spoke her name.

She had no name. Not anymore. Whatever her owners had called her had been left behind when they fled the fever, when they threw their property to the streets like spoiled grain.

Philon heard the commotion from his clinic. The thread hummed with his attention shifting—away from the patients who might live, toward the woman who would certainly die.

*Don't,* Lilith thought, though the word carried no power. She was observing now, not intervening. The isolation she had engineered was meant to create despair, not to create this—this reaching, this compulsion, this movement toward a dying woman no one else would touch.

He went anyway.

The guards parted for him. The crowd parted. The empty space around the fallen woman opened like a wound, and Philon walked into it with his bag slung across his shoulder and his hands already reaching.

Lilith felt what he felt when his fingers touched dying flesh.

Heat. Fever-heat that radiated through skin papery with dehydration, through the thin membrane between life and what came after. The woman's forehead burned against his palm—hot as fired clay, hot enough to feel through the calluses he had earned in twenty years of practice.

*Help me.*

The words did not travel across epochs. They did not need to. The woman's eyes found Philon's face, and the plea in them was older than language.

He knelt beside her.

Lilith's own knees pressed against something—the worn fabric of her armchair, the particular give of cushioning she had stopped noticing years ago. The sensation doubled: stone beneath his legs, fabric beneath hers. Cold tea in her hands, fever-skin beneath his fingertips.

The parallel crystallized.

*Philon reached for the dying woman. Lilith reached for the thread.*

The same gesture. The same compulsion. The same inability to stop, to weigh cost against benefit, to calculate whether this one was worth the hundred waiting behind.

"Bring water," Philon said to the crowd that would not approach. "And a litter. She needs shade and rest."

The words carried across the empty space—futile, necessary, the speech of a man who did not know how to stop trying.

*We are the same,* Lilith thought.

The observation arrived without alarm, without the horror that had accompanied it the first time with Ka. This was data now. Pattern recognition. The consciousness she tracked had a shape, and she was learning that shape, and the shape was familiar.

His hands under the slave woman's body, lifting her. Her awareness under the thread, following it.

Both of them had made themselves—alone with something they could not save.

She understood his mistake with perfect clarity. He was conflating service with sacrifice, obligation with obsession. He would die reaching for one more patient. He would die with his hands on flesh that was already cooling. He would die because he could not see that the one was costing him the hundred.

She saw it. She documented it. She filed it with the pattern she was mapping.

She did not see that her own hands—cold around ceramic gone cold—were performing the same gesture. Reaching. Holding. Unable to release.

The slave woman's weight settled against Philon's chest. Light—too light, the fever having consumed whatever substance she once held. He carried her toward his clinic, toward the small room where he would tend her until one of them stopped breathing.

Lilith watched.

The thread hummed with his compulsion, and she followed it, and neither of them understood that following was also reaching.
