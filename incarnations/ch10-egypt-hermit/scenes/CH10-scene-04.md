The delegation returned with the morning sun.

Macarius had not slept. The hours of darkness had passed in prayer—or what passed for prayer when the words moved through a mind too agitated to hold them. He had knelt until his knees screamed, sat until his back cramped, lay on the reed mat and stared at the darkness above him until the darkness seemed to stare back. When dawn came, it found him arranged in his customary posture, hands open on his knees, but the arrangement was a performance for an audience that had not yet arrived.

He heard them coming. Theophanes's voice carried even at this distance, and the scratch of stylus on wax tablet suggested the scribes were already recording their approach.

They entered without hesitation this time—the archdeacon in front, then the scribes, then the elderly priest. Theodora came last, and Macarius found his attention catching on her again with that same unexpected hook. She carried a small leather satchel today, the kind used for documents. Her face was composed into an expression of attentive blankness, revealing nothing, receiving everything.

"Abba Macarius." Theophanes settled onto the stone floor with the practiced ease of a man who had learned cross-legged sitting for occasions such as this. "Thank you for receiving us again. I trust your night was blessed."

"I trust yours brought rest."

A non-answer to a non-question. Theophanes acknowledged the parry with a slight inclination of his head. The scribes arranged themselves on either side, tablets ready, their postures identical in a way that suggested training rather than coincidence. The elderly priest settled near the doorway, where the light was best for reading.

Theodora remained standing. She moved to the wall opposite the doorway, positioning herself where she could observe both Macarius and the archdeacon without moving her head. The single dark strand of hair still fell across her left cheek. Her stillness was absolute.

"Before we begin," Theophanes said, "I would explain the purpose more fully. Bishop Athanasius does not seek merely to collect sayings, as others have done. He seeks understanding. What practice forms a man of God? What struggles attend the path? What wisdom has been purchased through the discipline of the desert?"

Macarius recognized the structure of the inquiry—it was the structure of the philosophical interview, the Socratic method dressed in Christian clothing. Lead with questions that flattered the subject's experience. Draw out responses. Shape those responses, through follow-up and clarification, into a coherent doctrine. He had performed this technique himself, once, in another life.

"Ask your questions."

Theophanes smiled. It was the smile of a man who has received permission he expected but could not take for granted. "Let us begin, then, with discipline. What regimen shapes your days?"

This at least was simple. Macarius recited the structure—the midnight office, the morning prayers, the hours of labor, the periods of silence and the periods of liturgy. He described it as he might describe the making of a basket: mechanically, without embellishment, as a sequence of actions rather than a path to transformation.

The scribes wrote. The styluses scratched. Theodora watched.

"And fasting?" Theophanes prompted. "The tales suggest great austerity."

"I eat what I need to continue. No more, no less."

"Some of the fathers claim to eat only once in three days. Others speak of years without bread."

"Others may do as their bodies permit. I am not others."

Theophanes nodded, apparently satisfied with the answer. But before he could continue, Theodora moved. It was a small movement—she leaned slightly to the side, adjusting her position against the wall, and whispered something toward Theophanes too quietly for Macarius to hear.

The archdeacon's eyebrows rose slightly. He paused, and then changed direction.

"Forgive me, Abba. I have been asking about practice, but perhaps I should ask instead about purpose. What draws a man to the desert? What keeps him here?"

It was a sharper question than anything that had come before. Macarius felt it land like a stone in still water, sending ripples outward through the composed surface of his attention.

"The desert strips away what is false."

"But what is true remains?"

"Something remains."

The scribes paused in their writing, sensing perhaps that this was material of a different quality. Theophanes leaned forward slightly, and Macarius was aware of the archdeacon's attention in a new way—not merely bureaucratic interest, but something closer to genuine curiosity.

"What sort of something, Abba?"

This was the question the young monks asked, the question that could not be answered in words yet must be answered nonetheless. Macarius felt the familiar movement within him—the shaping of thought into teaching, the compression of experience into aphorism.

"The soul," he said, and Theodora's head turned slightly, "is like water poured from vessel to vessel. The water remains the same. Only the shape of its containing changes. A man comes to the desert carrying many vessels—ambition, desire, fear, pride. The desert breaks them, one by one. What remains is the water itself."

He paused. The scribes were writing furiously. Theodora had shifted closer to the light from the doorway, and when she turned her gaze toward him—ostensibly to observe as part of her role—her left eye caught the morning sun directly. Within the deep brown, a crescent of pale green shimmered like something seen through water, visible from eleven to one o'clock like a mark of lunar phase.

She looked away before he could examine the phenomenon further.

"The water itself," Theophanes repeated, tasting the phrase. "Meaning the essence of the soul? The creation of God that remains when all else is stripped away?"

"Meaning what remains."

"And what do you call this remainder?"

Macarius was silent for a long moment. The question carried weight—it was asking for definition, for doctrine, for the kind of precision that belonged to Alexandria's debates rather than the desert's silences. The young monk Paphnutius had asked something similar, and Macarius had deflected with practical advice. But this was not a young monk. This was a representative of episcopal authority, and behind him, the woman whose stillness seemed to shape the direction of the inquiry itself.

"I call it nothing," Macarius said. "I have found that naming what cannot be named is the first step toward losing it."

Theodora whispered again. Theophanes nodded, as if to a suggestion.

"But Abba, surely something can be said. The fathers speak of theosis—union with God. Is this what you describe?"

"The fathers can speak as they choose. I speak of what I know, which is less than they know, and therefore less than I can give name to."

"Your humility is admirable."

Macarius felt the words land in a place they should not have been able to reach. *Your humility is admirable.* It was precisely the kind of compliment he had trained himself to dismiss—and yet it settled into him like warmth from a fire, spreading through his chest in a way that was not entirely comfortable.

"It is not humility to confess ignorance," he said, and his voice came out rougher than intended. "It is only accuracy."

Theophanes began to respond, but Theodora moved again—another whisper, another redirection. The archdeacon's questions shifted to other territory: the virtue of patience, the discipline of charity, the dangers of spiritual pride.

The irony was not lost on Macarius. But he answered because there was no honorable refusal, and because the answers, when they came, were genuine. He spoke of the subtle trap of measuring one's holiness against another's. He described the way asceticism could become its own form of grasping, the desert itself becoming a treasure to be hoarded rather than a tool to be used and discarded. He offered warnings and observations, and each one felt true as it left his lips—true, hard-won, purchased through fifteen years of struggle.

The scribes wrote everything down.

By the time the sun had climbed to its midday position, Theophanes was nodding with the satisfaction of a man who has collected exactly what he came for. His tablets were full. His scribes were resting their aching hands. The elderly priest had fallen asleep against the doorframe, his head nodding gently with each breath.

"You are generous, Abba. The bishop will be grateful for this gift."

Macarius said nothing. His throat was dry, and his body ached from hours of sitting, but beneath the physical discomfort was something else—a subtle vibration, almost pleasant, like the resonance of a bell struck hours ago and still faintly singing.

The delegation gathered their materials. Theophanes bowed with what appeared to be genuine reverence. The scribes tucked their tablets into satchels. The elderly priest woke with a start and began murmuring apologies.

Theodora was last to move. She paused in the doorway—just as she had paused the day before—and her attention rested on Macarius for a moment longer than the others'. Her face was still composed into that expression of attentive blankness, but her lips moved slightly, as if tasting words she did not speak.

Then she turned and was gone.

The silence that followed was not the silence Macarius knew. It was thicker, more charged, pregnant with something he could not identify. He sat in the center of his cell and breathed, and with each breath he felt the resonance of the morning's interview still vibrating through him.

*Your humility is admirable.*

*The bishop will be grateful.*

*The fathers speak of you.*

The words circled, circled, circled.

His hands, resting on his knees, were steady now. His body was tired but calm. And somewhere beneath both fatigue and calm, something else moved—something warm, something that felt very much like gratification, though he would not have used that word.

He reached for the prayer. *Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me.*

The words moved through him as they always did.

They did not reach where they were supposed to reach.
