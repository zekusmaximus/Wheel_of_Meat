Days passed, and the pattern broke.

The delegation remained camped by the well. Macarius saw them from a distance when he went to draw water—the flash of white linen among the brown robes of the monks who had begun to gather, the shape of Theophanes moving among them with the easy authority of an ambassador. Theodora he rarely saw; she kept to the periphery, silent, present in the way a shadow is present.

Word had spread.

He first understood this when Paphnutius returned—not alone, this time, but accompanied by three other young monks. They came at the hour of evening shadows, clustering at his threshold like supplicants, and the questions they asked had a different quality than before. They asked now about the interview. What had the archdeacon wanted to know? What answers had Macarius given? Was it true that his sayings would be recorded in Alexandria, preserved alongside the words of Antony himself?

Macarius answered briefly. The interview had been a duty. He had said nothing of importance. There was no glory in being recorded.

But the young monks nodded as if these denials were themselves teachings, and when they left, their voices carried across the sand, repeating what he had said as if it were scripture.

The routine he had maintained for fifteen years began to fragment.

Visitors came at times when visitors should not have come. A monk from Kellia, ancient and half-blind, arrived seeking a blessing. A merchant from the Nile valley appeared with supplies that had not been requested, offering them as gifts from the faithful who had heard of Abba Macarius's wisdom. A group of actual pilgrims—laypeople rather than monks—tracked him down and prostrated themselves in the sand outside his cell, asking only to be in his presence.

He sent them all away. But the sending took time, required words, demanded attention that should have been spent on prayer and weaving. His baskets grew no larger. His silence grew smaller.

The stillness that had been his companion for a decade and a half became harder to find. He would settle into prayer and find his thoughts circling back to the interview, to the words he had given, to the scribes' tablets now carrying his sayings toward Alexandria. He would pick up the palm fibers and discover his hands shaping wisdom instead of baskets—phrases for the visitors he expected, aphorisms polished to a shine before they were ever spoken.

*When a man seeks you out for teaching, give him less than he wants and more than he needs.*

He had not composed such a phrase, had he? It had arrived fully formed, as if from outside himself, ready for delivery. And yet it was his. He recognized its shape, its rhythm, the compression of insight that he had learned to perform.

Was this what the fathers meant by preparation for teaching? Or was it something else?

He did not want to look at the question too closely.

The delegation paid a second visit on the fourth day. Theophanes came with only one scribe this time, and the questions were gentler—clarifications, he said, of points that the bishop's scribes had flagged for further exploration. Theodora did not accompany them, but her absence was somehow more noticeable than her presence had been. Macarius found himself looking for her in the doorway, listening for the quality of her silence.

"The bishop has read your words with great attention," Theophanes said. "He sends his gratitude. He believes they may be of great use to the struggling faithful."

"The bishop is generous in his assessment."

"The bishop recognizes holiness." The archdeacon's voice was warm with something that felt like genuine admiration. "As do I, Abba. I have traveled to many cells in this desert, interviewed many anchorites. Few possess your clarity. Fewer still your ability to articulate the ineffable."

*The ineffable.* The word landed strangely. Macarius had told Theophanes, on the first day, that what could not be named should not be named. And now the archdeacon was praising him for naming it anyway—for giving words to wordless experience, for making the desert legible to those who would never walk it.

Was this not what the fathers did? Was this not the purpose of the Apophthegmata, the collected sayings that circulated among the faithful? To give language to the languageless, to offer handholds to those climbing a path they could not see?

And yet.

Part of him resisted the praise. Or rather, part of him resisted the ease with which he accepted the praise, the way it settled into his body like water into parched earth. He was too thirsty for this. He drank too deeply.

The scribe wrote. Theophanes asked his clarifying questions. Macarius answered—more carefully now, more conscious of how his words would look etched in wax and copied onto parchment. He found himself reaching for precision when simplicity would have served, for elegance when plainness was the desert way.

Was this vanity? Or was it only the natural desire to be understood correctly?

The distinction mattered. He could not tell, anymore, which side of the line he stood on.

After the delegation left, Macarius did not return to his baskets. He stood in the doorway of his cell and looked out at the desert—the endless sand, the distant shimmer of heat, the sky that held no cloud and offered no shade. For fifteen years, this view had been his anchor. The emptiness had calmed him. The absence had felt like presence.

Now the emptiness felt like scrutiny.

The sand seemed to wait for something. The sky seemed to measure him. The silence that had been his companion had become a mirror, reflecting back questions he did not want to answer.

He had told the young monks that the prayer was not a rope that binds the sheep but a noticing that the sheep had wandered. Every time you notice, you have already begun to return.

And yet he could not seem to return.

The thoughts scattered faster than he could gather them. His attention slid away from prayer like water from a tilted surface. He would begin the familiar words—*Lord Jesus Christ*—and find himself, sentences later, composing the next saying for the next visitor. He would reach for stillness and find instead the warmth of remembered praise, the pleasure of being sought out, the subtle rightness of a reputation beginning to formalize.

*Macarius of Scetis.*

*Macarius whose wisdom the bishop preserves.*

*Macarius whose words will outlast his body.*

The thoughts were not entirely unwelcome. That was the worst of it. They arrived dressed as humility—he was merely doing what the fathers had done, offering what had been given to him—but beneath the clothing, something else moved. Something hungry.

He pressed his palms against the mud-brick frame of the doorway. The texture was rough, grounding. He focused on it: the way the dried mud caught his skin, the faint coolness where the shade had protected it from the sun. This was real. This was solid. This was not the flickering unreality of thoughts about thoughts, the endless recursion of a mind watching itself watch itself.

He breathed.

And from the direction of the well, he heard Theodora's voice for the first time—low, measured, speaking to someone in the delegation camp about supply routes and travel arrangements. The voice carried across the sand with unusual clarity, as if the desert had chosen to amplify it.

She was speaking of him. He could not hear the words, but he knew this as certainly as he knew his own heartbeat. She was speaking of him to the others, shaping their understanding, guiding their approach.

*Why?*

The question surfaced before he could stop it. Why had she said nothing to him? Why did she watch with such intensity and then withdraw? Why did her presence feel heavier than the archdeacon's questions, more significant than the scribes' transcriptions, more disturbing than the pilgrims who prostrated themselves in his sand?

He did not know.

He was not certain he wanted to know.

The evening light shifted, and the shadows stretched, and somewhere inside him the thing that had cracked was beginning to widen.
