"It doesn't matter if I'm cursed," Wei said to no one, to the child, to the empty alcove where gods used to sit. "You're bleeding now. And I can stop that."

The words arrived in Lilith's awareness with the weight of revelation she hadn't intended, hadn't wanted, couldn't prevent. She felt the pattern shift beneath her sustained intervention the way someone feels ice crack underfoot—the recognition of wrong outcome arriving too late to change trajectory.

This is not what you were supposed to learn.

But Wei had learned it anyway. Learned it precisely because she'd made futility visible, because she'd ensured every person he saved died, because the pattern had become undeniable and instead of breaking him it had purified the one thing she needed broken: his attachment to outcome.

True determination. Outcome-independent. Helping because it was right, not because it would succeed.

She watched him clean the wound, extract the shrapnel, pack it with the last clean cloth. Watched him work with the same precision he'd always brought but emptied now of hope, of faith, of the contaminated belief that helping mattered because it saved. Helping mattered because someone was bleeding and he could stop bleeding. That was the entire equation. The trying was enough.

The trying was everything.

Manchester receded. The rain became distant percussion, her flat a peripheral awareness, her body in the chair just an anchor keeping her tethered while the historical timeline took foreground and she fell into it deeper than she'd gone before.

Six weeks compressed:

The boy survived. Wei added him to the ledger without satisfaction, without relief, just notation. The child walked out of the temple and into the siege and would die when the walls broke but not from this wound, not today, not from the curse Wei no longer believed in because he'd finally understood the curse was not his hands but his need for those hands to save rather than simply serve.

The Heavenly Kingdom collapsed around this understanding. Hong's son took nominal power—fifteen years old, terrified, surrounded by commanders fighting over scraps of authority. The Qing tunneled under the walls. Supplies ran out. The manna killed more than it fed. And Wei kept working, kept helping, kept reaching toward suffering without expectation it would end, without belief it would matter beyond the immediate moment of need meeting capacity.

July nineteenth. Dawn.

The walls broke.

Explosion first as thunder cracked in Manchester. Tunnels packed with powder, the West Wall section collapsing into rubble and dust and screaming. Wei woke to it in the temple, already reaching for his medical bag before consciousness fully returned, the reflex automatic, the compulsion transformed from pathology into something cleaner.

Forty wounded inside his aid station, too injured to evacuate. Two hundred civilians in the West Ward. Fifteen soldiers. The arithmetic brutal and simple: most would die. Organizing evacuation might save twenty or thirty.

Wei organized it anyway.

"Take the mobile civilians," he told the soldiers. "Try the West Gate. Fight through if you can."

"Lüshuai, come with us."

"My place is here." He gestured to the forty wounded. "Go."

They went. Wei watched them shepherd a hundred civilians toward the gate, watched them attempt the break-out, watched Qing cavalry intercept them in the street outside with precision that was too perfect, timing too exact, as if someone had arranged it.

Someone had.

Lilith had weighted the probabilities. Adjusted the patrol timing. Made certain the cavalry would be there, would be ready, would cut them down before they could scatter.

She watched the massacre from both timelines, Manchester and Tianjing superimposed. She felt each death as a small percussion in her awareness. One hundred civilians. Fifteen soldiers. Every person Wei had tried to save, slaughtered in the street while he watched from the temple steps.

He returned to the forty wounded inside. Knelt beside them. Held the hand of a boy—seventeen, bleeding from gut wound, dying—and lied gently: "It will be quick."

The Qing soldiers entered at noon.

Temple doors kicked open. Boots on stone. Orders shouted: "No quarter. Kill them all."

Wei stood. Placed himself between soldiers and wounded. Hands raised—not surrender, just clarity that he was unarmed, not a threat, only a physician who would not leave his patients.

They killed him first.

Spear through the chest—quick thrust, professional, the soldier who did it had done it before and knew the angle. Wei felt the pressure before pain, the wrongness of foreign object in the architecture of his body, the wetness spreading, the legs giving way.

He fell. Back hit stone. Ceiling visible above him—temple beams, dust motes in slanted light, smoke drifting through open doors. The smell was incense and blood and the sourness of bodies voiding under stress. Sound was screaming—the wounded being killed, the soldiers working methodically through the room—and his own breathing, wet and labored and failing.

The boy whose hand he'd been holding screamed. Cut off mid-syllable.

Wei's vision narrowed. Tunnel vision. Peripheral darkness closing. He could still see the ceiling, could still feel the cold stone under his back, could still taste copper and earth.

His last thought arrived clear and complete:

*I saved no one. The walls fell. The kingdom fell. Every hand I held went cold.*

*But the holding was not nothing.*

*The trying is never nothing.*

*I will try again.*

The thought passed through him and through the thread of his consciousness and through Lilith tracking it fifteen decades later, and she didn't read it, no, she experienced it. Felt it arrive in her awareness as if it were her own thought, her own recognition, her own determination crystallizing in the moment of death.

And then pain.

Sharp. Localized. Real.

Her chest, not his, tore open with agony that had no source in Manchester, no wound in her body, no explanation except the impossible one she refused to accept. She doubled over in the chair, gasping, while in Tianjing Wei's last breath left him and the pattern she'd imposed from outside revealed itself as a pattern she'd been living from inside.

Whose death is this?

The question arrived with the pain. Physical sensation she could not explain, could not dismiss as exhaustion or proximity or the cost of sustained attention. This was different. This was her chest splitting. This was her breath stopping. This was death happening to her while she watched him die and the membrane between observer and observed dissolved in the instant of his leaving.

She surfaced gasping. Manchester solid around her again—rain hammering windows, flat cold, autumn light gone gray. Tianjing receded to echo: smoke smell phantom, screaming memory, the sensation of spear-in-chest fading but the ache remaining.

Filed it. Had to file it. Exhaustion. Too close. Too sustained. The cost of two years compressed into days of tracking.

Not examined. Not again. Not ever.

But the truth her body knew and her mind refused: that she had felt Wei Shufen die as if his death were hers, that the pattern connecting them exceeded intervention and approached something she had no framework to understand, that the pain was recognition her awareness could not yet name.

The backfire crashed down.

Not like the others. This one was structural. This one was catastrophic.

Understanding arrived with the weight of walls collapsing: she had made futility visible. She had ensured everyone Wei saved died. She had created the conditions that should have broken his determination—attachment to outcome, need to succeed, the grasping that made helping about salvation rather than service.

And by breaking it, she had purified it.

*I didn't break him. I purified him.*

Nine interventions. Nine backfires. She counted them now, the arithmetic she'd avoided, the ledger she'd refused to keep:

Chandra—she'd tried to corrupt generosity through bureaucratic distance, and it had forged cleaner giving. Philon—she'd tried to shatter wisdom through martyrdom, and it had clarified seeing without sacrifice. Verinus—she'd tried to break virtue through impossible contradiction, and it had tempered ethical action without rigid certainty. Macarius—she'd tried to exploit performance, and it had burned away false humility into genuine uncertainty. Kaoru—she'd tried to weaponize grasping at beauty, and it had released attachment to outcome. Diego—she'd tried to poison patience through injustice, and it had purified endurance without bitterness. Jean—she'd tried to fracture truthfulness through impossible doubt, and it had crystallized honest action when certainty was impossible. The glimpses between, the lives she'd touched and adjusted, the interventions that blurred into pattern.

And now Wei. The ninth. The catastrophic one.

She had made futility visible. And instead of breaking, he had released the last contamination—determination attached to success, determination that needed saving to justify helping.

*All ten perfections. I've accelerated all ten perfections.*

The thought arrived with the clarity of something she could no longer deny. Not just one more backfire. Not just determination purified. The accumulated weight of every quality she'd tried to prevent—cooperation, generosity, wisdom, virtue, renunciation, patience, equanimity, truthfulness, determination—all of it forged rather than fractured. All of it approaching completion.

Nine interventions. Nine backfires. Each one designed to break had built instead. Each method had produced the opposite of what she intended.

Emotional manipulation. Intellectual precision. Sustained circumstantial interference.

Every approach had accelerated what she opposed.

*He's approaching stream-entry. One more significant life and he crosses.*

The next incarnation—the one already living, the one she could sense at the edge of her awareness—would be the breaking point. The chains she felt in her own architecture, he would shed them. Perhaps permanently.

*Historical intervention: impossible.*

The pattern was structural. Opposition accelerated what she opposed. Distance allowed what proximity might prevent.

She sat in her flat, hunched over the ache in her chest that had no wound to show for it, and understood: the race had narrowed. Whatever time she'd thought she had was gone. He was approaching the threshold faster than she'd calculated, and the approaching was her doing, and the only thing left was the pivot she should have made years ago.

She had to find him. Now. In this life. Before the wheel turned again.

Manchester rain. Autumn cold. The violence of calm returning as Tianjing's violence receded.

And beneath it all, the pain that had no explanation she would accept, the connection she could not name, the pattern larger than her awareness could hold.

Not examined.

Never examined.

The work continued.
