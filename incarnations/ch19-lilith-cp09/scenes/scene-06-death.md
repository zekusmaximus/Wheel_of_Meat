# Scene 6: The Death

July 19, 1864.

The walls fell before dawn.

Lilith felt it as a kind of shudder through the tracking—the moment when inevitability stopped being prophecy and became present tense. Mining tunnels had undermined the northern fortifications. The Qing sappers had done their work well. When the charges detonated, sections of the wall that had stood for eighteen months of siege collapsed inward, and the forces that had been waiting for two years surged through.

Wei was already awake. She had been awake for hours, Lilith thought—though the tracking didn't always make such details clear. Perhaps she'd felt it coming. Perhaps she'd never really slept, these final days.

The aid station was full. Too full. Wounded from the previous day's fighting had arrived faster than they could be treated, and the triage arithmetic had collapsed under the weight of impossible choices. There were perhaps forty patients on pallets. Another twenty on the floor. A handful of workers—nurses, orderlies, the few who hadn't fled—moved among them with expressions that suggested they knew this was the last shift.

When the explosion came, everyone stopped.

Then, slowly, they started again. Because stopping wouldn't change anything.

Wei moved to the entrance of the temple. Lilith followed, adjusting her observation to track both the larger chaos and the particular woman moving through it.

The city was dying in real time. Qing soldiers—regular forces supplemented by the Ever Victorious Army, foreign-led and foreign-armed—poured through the breaches. The defenders who remained fought, but it was the fighting of desperation, not strategy. Everywhere, people ran. Everywhere, smoke rose.

Wei assessed the situation with the calm of someone who had already made peace with what was coming.

"Can we evacuate?" one of the orderlies asked. He was young, barely twenty. His hands were shaking.

Wei looked at the forty patients who couldn't walk. At the twenty who could walk but couldn't fight. At the city that was falling around them.

"No," she said.

But then she did something Lilith didn't expect.

She began organizing an evacuation anyway.

*What are you doing?* Lilith thought—not in frustration, but in genuine curiosity. Watching Wei direct the mobile patients toward a side door, watching her assign orderlies to carry litters, watching her chart a path through the chaos toward a gate she couldn't possibly reach.

She knew it was futile. Lilith could feel her knowing. The Qing forces were everywhere. The evacuation route would be cut off within an hour. Most of these patients would die before nightfall.

She was doing it anyway.

*Purified determination*, Lilith thought. *This is what it looks like.*

She could have intervened. She still had circumstantial access; she could have adjusted the timing of the Qing advance, slowed it, redirected it away from the evacuation route.

But she didn't.

Partly because she suspected it wouldn't work—every intervention had backfired, and intervening to *help* the evacuation might somehow make it worse.

And partly because she wanted to see what happened. What this soul would do at the very end, with no illusions left to sustain it.

Wei got twenty-three patients out of the temple. She organized them into a convoy—litters carried by the ambulatory, the orderlies forming a rough perimeter—and sent them toward the eastern gate.

Then she went back.

"What are you doing?" the young orderly asked.

"There are people who can't be moved," Wei said. "I'm staying with them."

The orderly stared at her. Then, slowly, he nodded. He stayed too.

Lilith watched them return to the temple, to the seventeen patients who remained—too wounded to walk, too wounded to be carried, too wounded for anything except waiting.

The Qing cavalry found the evacuation convoy an hour later. Lilith didn't need to adjust anything; the interception happened on its own, a consequence of the routes available and the forces deployed. All twenty-three patients died. All the orderlies who accompanied them died.

The convoy had been doomed from the moment Wei organized it.

*She knew*, Lilith thought. *She knew, and she did it anyway.*

Because the trying was not nothing.

In the temple, Wei waited.

She treated the wounds of the patients who remained. She talked to those who could still hear, telling them—Lilith couldn't quite parse the words, but the tone was steady, reassuring, the voice of someone who wasn't pretending the end wasn't coming, but also wasn't letting the end define the moment.

The Qing forces arrived at mid-morning.

Wei stood.

She positioned herself between the soldiers and the patients. The young orderly stood beside her. There were no weapons in their hands. There was no way to fight.

Wei's final thought came through the tracking with unexpected clarity—not words, exactly, but meaning. A kind of summary. A closing argument.

*I saved no one. The walls fell. The kingdom fell. Every hand I held went cold.*

A pause.

*But the holding was not nothing. The trying is never nothing.*

And then, with something that felt almost like certainty:

*I will try again.*

The weapon fell.

Lilith felt Wei's death as a kind of hollowing—the soul passing through, the consciousness flickering, the pattern that had been Wei Shufen releasing its current form and flowing onward toward whatever came next.

And she felt something else.

Something she didn't have a name for.

A tightness in her chest that corresponded to nothing in the observation. A weight behind her eyes. A sensation that had no strategic value and shouldn't exist at all.

*Why?* she thought, too surprised to suppress the question. *Why does it hurt to watch her die?*

She'd watched him—her—die eight times now. Death was a waypoint, not an ending. The soul moved on. The pattern continued. There was nothing tragic about transition.

But something in her—something deep, something she didn't want to examine—ached at the moment of Wei's passing.

Not grief, exactly. Something closer to... recognition. As if something in Wei's final thought had touched something in Lilith that she hadn't known was there.

*The trying is never nothing.*

She filed the sensation for later examination. She had work to do.
