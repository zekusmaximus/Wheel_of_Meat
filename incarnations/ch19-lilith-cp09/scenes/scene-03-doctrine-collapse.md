# Scene III: The Doctrine Collapse

The bowl sat in Wei's hands and the wrongness of it registered across timelines as smell before understanding: green and rot together, vegetation that had given up being food and become only fiber, only bulk, only the pretense of sustenance.

Manna.

Hong Xiuquan's decree: "The Heavenly Father provides sweet dew from the palace gardens, as He did for the Israelites in the wilderness. Eat and be sustained."

Reality: weeds pulled from between paving stones, grass clippings, bark stripped from decorative trees in courtyards that had once held beauty and now held only desperation. Boiled into paste or eaten raw, distributed by the Holy Treasury to a population that had moved past hunger into the hollow country beyond it where the body consumed itself for fuel and the mind narrowed to the width of the next mouthful.

Wei stared at the bowl. In Manchester, Lilith stared at nothing—her flat's white wall, the rain still steady against windows, the autumn light gone thin and gray. Both of them motionless. Both of them witnessing the moment theology collapsed under the weight of meat's undeniable truth.

This is not God, Wei thought. This is a man lying to himself while his people starve.

The recognition arrived clean and final. No rage. No bitterness. Just the simple arithmetic of bodies that needed rice and were being given weeds, of doctrine that promised protection while artillery reduced walls to rubble and hunger reduced people to the skeletal geometries of failure.

He did not eat the manna. Gave his portion to a child—boy, seven perhaps, belly distended with kwashiorkor—and watched the child choke it down because hunger had become more pressing than taste, than dignity, than the knowledge that this would kill slower than starvation but kill nonetheless.

The dysentery outbreak started three days later.

Fifty cases in Wei's ward. No medicine. No clean water. The latrines had overflowed and the wells were contaminated and the disease spread through the West Ward like fire through paper, reducing people who were already meat and bone to something less—bodies that voided themselves of what little substance remained, that dehydrated into husks, that died with their mouths open and their eyes fixed on nothing.

Wei worked. Boiled rags for compresses. Used ash to pack wounds. Held basins while people retched. The smell saturated everything—shit and rot and the sourness of systems failing. In Manchester the rain brought its own smell through the window Lilith had cracked open: petrichor and diesel, urban autumn, the scent of nothing dying because nothing here was that close to death yet.

But the pressure in her chest built anyway.

She dismissed it. Tension from sustained tracking. The cost of proximity maintained too long. Nothing that required examination.

The pressure continued.

Hong Xiuquan died on the first day of the sixth month. Official story: ascended to heaven to sit at the right hand of the Heavenly Father. Whispered truth: ate manna, went mad, died raving. They found him in his chambers with green paste on his lips and his eyes rolled back and the theological architecture of the Heavenly Kingdom evacuated from his skull, leaving only meat that had believed itself divine and discovered too late the body's veto over doctrine.

Wei felt nothing when the news came. The emptiness where faith had been was not new emptiness—it had been hollowing for months, for years, since the first time he'd watched someone he'd saved die for reasons he couldn't explain, since the pattern had become undeniable, since the whispers started and he'd begun to see himself as the curse rather than the cure.

The Heavenly King was dead. The kingdom was dying. And Wei had become a student of patterns he could not break.

That night—June third, 1864, though he'd stopped tracking dates with the same precision he'd once tracked saved versus lost—Wei sat in the empty Buddha alcove of the converted temple. The idol had been smashed years ago when the Taiping first took Tianjing, when they'd declared all other gods false and only the Heavenly Father true. Now the alcove held nothing. Just stone and shadow and the particular quality of absence that marked where something sacred had been removed.

He sat in that absence and made a decision.

Everyone I help dies. Hong is dead. The kingdom is dead. I am the common factor.

Conclusion: I should stop.

For two days, he refused new patients. Told them to see Old Huang, see the other medics, see anyone but him because his hands had become instruments of delayed murder rather than healing. The ledger had inverted—more lost than saved, the gap widening—and the only rational response was to remove himself from the equation. Stop helping. Stop counting. Stop being the one who reached toward suffering as if reaching could solve it.

Lilith watched this paralysis and called it victory.

Finally, she thought. He's breaking. I've won.

The certainty should have felt like satisfaction. Should have settled through her the way rain settled into soil, inevitable and right. But instead the pressure in her chest tightened. Became localized. Became almost pain.

She blamed the flat's poor heating. Blamed the sustained attention. Blamed anything except the truth her body knew and her mind refused: that Wei's paralysis registered in her awareness as her own, that his choice to stop helping felt like something stopping in herself, that the pattern she'd imposed on him from outside was also a pattern she was living from inside.

Whose paralysis is this?

The question arrived and she dismissed it immediately. Filed it with the other cognitive noise—the hesitations she'd been suppressing since Macarius, the pull toward Silas that exceeded tactical necessity, the kinship she kept recognizing and refusing to examine.

Not relevant. Not now.

What mattered was the work.

In Tianjing, Wei sat motionless in the empty alcove. In Manchester, Lilith sat motionless in her chair. Rain continued. Siege continued. Both of them waiting in the space between action and paralysis, between helping and stopping, between the compulsion that had defined them and the recognition that the compulsion might be destroying rather than serving.

The temple was silent except for distant artillery—a sound so constant it had become the texture of air rather than event. The flat was silent except for rain—the same constancy, the same redefinition of normal.

Two kinds of violence. Two kinds of waiting.

Both held in the same awareness, the same breath.

And beneath it all, the pressure in her chest that had no source she could name, no explanation she would accept, no resolution except the one approaching that she could not yet see.
