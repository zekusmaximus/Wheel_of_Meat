# Scene 1: The Method

The notebooks surrounded her in concentric rings, their spines cracked from use, their margins dense with her handwriting. The earliest ones—from that first year when the awareness had bloomed unbidden—were almost illegible now, the ink faded, the paper soft from handling. The recent ones maintained their clinical precision. Progress, she supposed. Or repetition disguised as refinement.

Lilith sat cross-legged in the corner of her flat that had ceased to be a corner and become, over eight years, a command center. She had not opened the curtains in days. The Manchester dawn struggled through anyway, milk-grey light filtering around the edges, the particular color of English winter mornings that seemed designed to make urgency feel foolish.

Three coffee cups on the floor beside her, their contents at various stages of abandonment. The flat smelled of stale grounds and the particular staleness of a space whose inhabitant had been elsewhere—not physically, but attentionally—for too long.

Her body knew this posture. Eight years of returning to this corner, this position, these notebooks. She had read once about monks who sat so long their knees wore grooves in temple floors. The comparison would once have amused her. Now it merely described.

She opened the notebook labeled *Forward Scan: Year Eight*.

The technique had evolved. That first accidental glimpse in her twenty-fifth year—the dying man in ancient waters, the face that wasn't a face but somehow was—had grown into something she could almost control. The key was death. Not her own, but his. Each time he died, the soul's passage created a signature she could follow. Like tracing the path of a river by the sediment it deposited, the traces clearest at the moment of transition.

*Follow the transitions*, she had written three years ago. *Map the trajectory.*

It worked. It worked imperfectly, with gaps she couldn't fill and connections she was forced to infer, but it worked. She had traced him backward to the primordial—that protohuman who had first touched something she recognized as kin. She had traced him forward through Egypt, Rome, Athens, medieval Spain. Each death a waypoint. Each life a data point.

And now, after a year of intensive work, she had nearly completed the forward scan.

She was close. Close enough to feel him. Not in the tracking way, not in the awareness that let her observe his past lives, but in a different register entirely. A presence in the world. A weight on the same scale where she stood.

*He's here*, she had written last month, underlining it twice. *Somewhere in this timeline. This city, possibly. I can feel the terminus of the thread.*

Today she would observe the Taiping incarnation. The last major waypoint before the modern era. After that, a brief scan through the mid-twentieth century, and then—

Then she would find him.

Her NHS position had thinned to something barely defensible. Colleagues had stopped asking if she was all right; they had learned to read her absence even when she was present. She had let it happen. The cosmic scope of what she pursued made ordinary professional concerns feel like children's games played by the side of a roaring ocean.

This was the cost of seeing what she saw. Not physical strain—her body remained capable, her mind remained sharp—but the gradual, voluntary withdrawal from everything that didn't matter. And increasingly, only one thing mattered.

The transition was easier now than it had been. That first year, she'd fought against the dissolution of ordinary perception, uncertain what she was becoming. Now she simply... allowed it. Like releasing a held breath. The releasing was almost relief.

Her flat receded. Not vanished—she could still feel the floor beneath her, the cool morning air on her skin—but it became distant. Secondary. A fading signal beneath a stronger one.

Time became porous.

She reached backward through the thread she'd been following, feeling for the death that preceded him. The Renaissance skeptic—Jean, she'd learned, though names rarely mattered—had died on a road in France, refusing to offer certainty he didn't possess. His death had the particular brightness of alignment, that clean quality she'd learned to recognize when someone died integrated with whatever they truly were. The soul had passed onward, carrying what it had learned, seeding what would come next.

And what came next was this: China. 1862. A kingdom falling, a faith fracturing, a healer who couldn't stop trying to save people she knew she couldn't save.

She let herself drift forward along the thread. The texture changed—different century, different geography, different constraints. Where the Renaissance thread had tasted of uncertainty transmuted into principle, this one tasted of determination still contaminated by hope. She believed, this incarnation. Believed in the divine kingdom she was dying to protect. Believed that her healing hands served a purpose beyond their immediate use.

Lilith felt the familiar recognition—not pleasure exactly, but something closer to professional regard. This was a worthy configuration. Determination attached to outcomes. The kind of structure that could, with precise intervention, be shown its own limits.

The thread stabilized. She felt herself settling into observation—not inhabitation, not yet, but presence. She could see without being seen. She could watch without participating.

Though after eight years, she'd learned that watching always became participating. Every observation was also an intervention. Every attention she paid created ripples she couldn't fully control.

She understood this. She understood, too, the deeper irony—that her interventions had never once produced the result she intended. Eight years. Eight attempts. Eight backfires.

And still she continued. This was its own lesson, though she couldn't quite read it.

She opened herself to 1862.

Spring. Siege conditions. A temple converted to an aid station.

And him. Her. The one she followed.

Wei Shufen. A woman this time—interesting. She'd noted early that the soul's gender wasn't fixed, though in her observation it tended to cluster around certain presentations more than others. This version was female, early thirties, Hakka ethnicity. Lüshuai rank—captain, in Western terms. Medical training gained somewhere informal but effective.

She was treating wounded soldiers at dawn.

Lilith watched, feeling the familiar settling of observation into position. Like sliding into the role she'd learned over a decade of practice. Witness. Analyst. The one who saw what was truly at stake.

*Let's see what you're carrying*, she thought at the woman who moved efficiently among the bleeding men, her hands steady, her face expressionless in a way that spoke of long practice.

*Let's see how deep the attachment runs.*
