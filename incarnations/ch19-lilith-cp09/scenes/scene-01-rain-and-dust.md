Rain drummed Manchester windows and dust rose from Tianjing's broken walls—two species of violence held in the same awareness, the same breath. Lilith sat in her Fallowfield flat, Week 8 or 9 of tracking (she'd stopped counting days when the pursuit became fever), and felt the autumn cold seep through cheap walls while smoke from artillery fires seeped through centuries. The sound was rain and also artillery. The silence was her flat's emptiness and also the weighted quiet before massacre. Both true. Both present. Both bleeding through the membrane of her attention like temperature through glass.

Tea sat beside her, gone cold. The film on its surface might have formed an hour ago or this morning—she could not have said which. Outside her window, leaves fell from trees that had not existed when Wei Shufen first lifted a scalpel, first wrapped bandages around wounds that would kill anyway, first began the compulsive counting that mirrored her own. Autumn in Manchester. The slow dying of the year. In Tianjing, it was summer 1862, then winter 1863, then spring 1864—two years compressed into her sustained attention, a siege she'd been watching for days that had lasted for the besieged across seasons they'd measured in starvation and hope's slow erosion.

The thread of his consciousness hummed at the edge of perception. Different from the others—from Chandra's bureaucratic weight, from Philon's philosophical skin-knowledge, from Verinus's procedural certainty, from all the faces that had come before and between. This one methodical, medical, obsessive in its helping. His hands moved through her awareness: herb-stained fingers checking bandages, checking pulses, checking the arithmetic of saved versus lost with the same compulsion she brought to tracking intervention against backfire.

She saw the parallel before suppressing it.

Wei at his makeshift desk in the converted temple, charcoal in hand, updating his ledger: 103 saved, 97 lost. The gap closing. The numbers approaching equilibrium like a equation solving toward zero. And Lilith in her flat, tracking her own arithmetic—Chandra, Philon, Verinus, Macarius, Kaoru, Diego, Jean, and the glimpses between them, the lives she'd seen in passing, the deaths that blurred into pattern rather than staying discrete as memory. She didn't count them. Counting implied finitude. This had gone on too long for numbers.

But this time would be different.

This time: sustained intervention. Not a single corrupted relationship or a dream planted or evidence altered. Two years of circumstantial manipulation—artillery timing adjusted so evacuees died, intelligence leaked so healed soldiers walked into ambush, disease vectors guided toward specific patients, supply lines failed at calculated moments. Making futility visible. Everyone Wei saved would die anyway, and he would see the pattern, and the pattern would break him, and determination—the last perfection, the one she'd watched him approach across lifetimes—would crack before it crystallized.

Her certainty sat in her chest like stone, like ice, like the autumn cold that had nothing to do with Manchester weather.

The rain continued. The dust continued. Both true.

Wei's hands reached for another patient—a soldier, shrapnel wound, survivable if treated—and she watched the moment of his choice. He would help. He always helped. His compulsion matched hers: the inability to look away, to stop, to delegate what consumed him. She watched him work, and in Manchester her own hands tightened around the cold ceramic of the mug she'd forgotten to drink from, and neither of them noticed the gesture was the same.

The siege pressed inward. The walls held but the people inside were dying of hunger, of disease, of the violence of systems failing under pressure. And she'd made it worse. Guided it. Made certain that every hand Wei reached toward would go cold, every wound he closed would reopen, every patient he saved would return to him as a name on the list of the dead.

In two years—his two years, her days—the pattern had taken shape.

Soldiers whispered: "Don't let the lüshuai treat you. Everyone he touches dies."

She'd heard the whisper arrive in Wei's awareness like a stone dropped in still water. Watched the ripples spread through his careful certainty. He'd dismissed it at first—coincidence, the chaos of war, normal attrition in a siege where everyone was dying on installment. But the pattern persisted. Became undeniable. Twelve of fifteen patients tracked, dead within weeks. The arithmetic inverting: more lost than saved, and all of them—every single one—passing through his hands first.

This intervention will work.

The phrase settled through her like sediment, like certainty, like the rain that fell steady and relentless on Manchester while in Tianjing the summer heat pressed down on a city running out of water, out of rice, out of the manna Hong Xiuquan claimed God provided but which killed faster than it fed.

She leaned forward. Manchester and Tianjing both. Watching Wei update his ledger again—133 saved, 128 lost, five left before the numbers crossed—and she did not see herself doing the same calculation. Did not see that his patient ledger and her intervention ledger were the same compulsion at different scales. Did not see that the trying which consumed him consumed her with equal ferocity, equal blindness, equal certainty that the next attempt would finally balance the arithmetic of suffering against salvation.

Rain on windows. Dust from walls. The sound of both kinds of violence, held.

She watched. She waited. The wheel turned, and neither of them knew they were already caught in it.
