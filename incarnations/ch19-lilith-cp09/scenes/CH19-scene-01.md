Rain drummed Manchester windows and dust rose from Tianjing's broken walls. Two species of violence held in the same awareness, the same breath. Lilith sat in her Fallowfield flat, Week 8 or 9 of tracking (she'd stopped counting days when the pursuit became fever), and felt the autumn cold seep through cheap walls while smoke from artillery fires seeped through centuries. The sound was rain and also artillery. The silence was her flat's emptiness and also the weighted quiet before massacre. Both true. Both present. Both bleeding through the membrane of her attention like temperature through glass.

Tea sat beside her, gone cold. The film on its surface might have formed an hour ago or this morning—she could not have said which. Outside her window, leaves fell from trees that had not existed when Wei Shufen first lifted a scalpel, first wrapped bandages around wounds that would kill anyway, first began the compulsive counting that mirrored her own. Autumn in Manchester. The slow dying of the year. In Tianjing, it was summer 1862, then winter 1863, then spring 1864. Two years compressed into her sustained attention, a siege she'd been watching for days that had lasted for the besieged across seasons they'd measured in starvation and hope's slow erosion.

The thread of his consciousness hummed at the edge of perception, and the signature confirmed what should have been impossible.

Eight iterations of progress, crystallized into behavior before she could observe him struggling.

She watched Wei move within the Taiping medical hierarchy with the ease of someone who had long since dissolved isolation as default. He coordinated with Old Huang, deferred to expertise when another medic knew more, shared supplies when sharing meant his own patients might go without. Ka's separation—the herder who could not work with the collective—was absent. This one worked the networks naturally, as if cooperation had never been a struggle.

When he treated patients, he gave equal attention regardless of status. Soldiers and civilians, officers and conscripts, faithful Taiping and quiet doubters—each received the same careful hands, the same precise diagnosis, the same presence. Chandra's ledger-mind, that bureaucratic distance that weighed recipient against worth, had dissolved into something cleaner. He gave his own rations to a starving child without calculation, without the arithmetic of deserve.

The diagnostic clarity persisted. She watched him recognize the siege was unwinnable, watched him understand that Hong's "manna decree" revealed delusion rather than divinity, and he didn't despair. Philon's wisdom intact—the capacity to see systems clearly while remaining useful within them. Bodies told truth that theology denied; he heard the bodies.

He maintained ethical standards despite impossible scarcity, didn't abandon protocols when supplies ran out, held to medical integrity even when integrity produced enemies. Verinus's rigid certainty was absent—he acted virtuously without requiring perfect conditions, without the brittle righteousness that had shattered under pressure in Rome.

Even Macarius's performance had dissolved. This one held genuine uncertainty about the Heavenly Kingdom's theology, not tactical neutrality. His faith crisis was honest, not displayed for witness. No holy doubt that needed audience. The humility was real.

Kaoru's grasping had released—he accepted that the siege would end badly, held his dying patients without freezing the care. The attachment to outcome that had made the monk cling to beauty as proof of enlightenment was absent. Wei treated the dying as carefully as the recoverable.

And there: Jean's inheritance. She watched him doubt Taiping doctrine—the Heavenly Father's protection, the divine mandate, the promises that corpses disproved daily—without bitterness. Clean doubt. Honest uncertainty. Still functional. He told patients the truth about their chances without cynicism, acted ethically when certainty was impossible. Doubt had not become fortress.

Diego's patience too. The capacity to endure. She had created a pattern of impossible deaths—everyone he saved died within weeks—and he hadn't hardened. Watched the numbers invert and kept treating patients. The "curse" she'd manufactured hadn't poisoned his presence. He endured watching everyone he touched die without letting futility become hatred.

Eight patterns, integrated into behavior before she could observe him struggling.

What remained was contaminated: determination still attached to outcomes—the ledger he kept, the count he maintained, the need to be "the one who saves." His hands moved through her awareness: herb-stained fingers checking bandages, checking pulses, checking the arithmetic of saved versus lost with the same compulsion she brought to tracking intervention against backfire.

She saw the parallel before suppressing it.

Wei at his makeshift desk in the converted temple, charcoal in hand, updating his ledger: 103 saved, 97 lost. The gap closing. The numbers approaching equilibrium like an equation solving toward zero. And Lilith in her flat, tracking her own arithmetic—nine interventions, nine backfires, the many lives and many deaths blurring into pattern rather than staying discrete as memory. His patient ledger and her intervention ledger. The same compulsion at different scales.

She didn't count them. Counting implied finitude. This had gone on too long for numbers.

But this time would be different.

This time: sustained intervention. Not a single corrupted relationship or a dream planted or evidence altered. Two years of circumstantial manipulation. Artillery timing adjusted so evacuees died, intelligence leaked so healed soldiers walked into ambush, disease vectors guided toward specific patients, supply lines failed at calculated moments. Making futility visible. Everyone Wei saved would die anyway, and he would see the pattern, and the pattern would break him. Determination—the last perfection, the one she'd watched him approach across lifetimes, would crack before it crystallized.

Her certainty sat in her chest like stone, like ice, like the autumn cold that had nothing to do with Manchester weather.

The rain continued. The dust continued. Both true.

Wei's hands reached for another patient. This one a soldier, shrapnel wound, survivable if treated. Lilith watched the moment of his choice. He would help. He always helped. His compulsion matched hers: the inability to look away, to stop, to delegate what consumed him. She watched him work, and in Manchester her own hands tightened around the cold ceramic of the mug she'd forgotten to drink from, and neither of them noticed the gesture was the same.

The siege pressed inward. The walls held but the people inside were dying of hunger, of disease, of the violence of systems failing under pressure. And she'd made it worse. Guided it. Made certain that every hand Wei reached toward would go cold, every wound he closed would reopen, every patient he saved would return to him as a name on the list of the dead.

In two years the pattern had taken shape.

Soldiers whispered: "Don't let the lüshuai treat you. Everyone he touches dies."

She'd heard the whisper arrive in Wei's awareness like a stone dropped in still water. Watched the ripples spread through his careful certainty. He'd dismissed it at first as coincidence, the chaos of war, normal attrition in a siege where everyone was dying on installment. But the pattern persisted. Became undeniable. Twelve of fifteen patients tracked, dead within weeks. The arithmetic inverting: more lost than saved, and every single one passing through his hands first.

This intervention will work.

The phrase settled through her like sediment, like certainty, like the rain that fell steady and relentless on Manchester while in Tianjing the summer heat pressed down on a city running out of water, out of rice, out of the manna Hong Xiuquan claimed God provided but which killed faster than it fed.

She leaned forward. Manchester and Tianjing both. Watching Wei update his ledger again: 133 saved, 128 lost, five left before the numbers crossed. She did not see herself doing the same calculation. Did not see that his patient ledger and her intervention ledger were the same compulsion at different scales. Did not see that the trying which consumed him consumed her with equal ferocity, equal blindness, equal certainty that the next attempt would finally balance the arithmetic of suffering against salvation.

Rain on windows. Dust from walls. The sound of both kinds of violence, held.

She watched. She waited. The wheel turned, and neither of them knew they were already caught in it.
