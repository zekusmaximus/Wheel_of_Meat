# Scene 3: The Intervention

Time moved strangely during extended tracking. Lilith had learned to stop fighting the temporal distortion, to accept that hours in 1862 might correspond to minutes in her Manchester flat or—she'd discovered once, to her disquiet—to three full days of lost time that she couldn't account for afterward.

This was the cost. Not physical strain—her body bore it well enough—but *attentional* cost. Hours or days vanished from her ordinary life while she was present elsewhere. Her career, her relationships, her connection to anything that wasn't this—all of it eroded not through exhaustion but through absence. She chose this erosion. That distinction mattered to her, though she wasn't sure it should.

She let the intervention unfold across what felt like weeks but was probably less subjective time than that. The manipulations she'd set in motion required patience. Small causes; large effects. The same precision she would apply to any complex system, informed by decades of study and centuries of awareness.

Summer 1862.

Wei's ledger read: *71 saved. 58 lost.*

The gap was closing.

Lilith observed from her usual strange angle, watching Wei treat a mass casualty event. Thirty-two wounded from a single breach in the northern wall. The Qing forces had gotten closer this time, holding their position long enough to do real damage before the Taiping defenders pushed them back.

Wei worked through the triage with her characteristic efficiency, but something had changed in her face. A tightness around the eyes that hadn't been there in spring. A pause, barely perceptible, before each touch—as if she were bracing herself for what she might find.

*She's starting to notice the pattern*, Lilith thought.

The numbers told a story Wei couldn't ignore. Patients she'd saved in spring were dying in summer. The young soldier with the broken arm had caught typhoid from contaminated water—water that Lilith had carefully arranged to be contaminated—and had died sweating and delirious within a week of returning to his unit. A family Wei had evacuated to a safer neighborhood had returned when the fighting shifted, only to be killed when artillery struck their temporary lodgings.

The artillery had been aiming for a different target. Lilith had adjusted its timing by approximately four seconds.

She observed her own work with the clinical detachment of a surgeon reviewing an operation. Small adjustments. Untraceable causes. The butterfly's wing, applied with precision.

But something in her sat uneasily with the work. She recognized the feeling from earlier interventions—the seventh and eighth in particular, when she had begun to suspect that her methods were producing the opposite of their intended effects. She filed the unease and continued.

Fall 1862.

Wei's ledger read: *103 saved. 97 lost.*

Nearly even.

The theological framework was straining visibly now. Hong Xiuquan's sermons—delivered through increasingly erratic channels as the Heavenly King retreated into visions and pronouncements—spoke of divine protection, of suffering purified by faith, of victory guaranteed by God's word.

Wei knelt through the services, her hands folded correctly, her responses timed properly. But Lilith, observing from her strange angle, could feel the hollowness spreading.

*She still prays*, Lilith noted. *But the prayers have stopped being conversation. They've become ritual.*

Spring 1863.

Wei's ledger read: *133 saved. 128 lost.*

The gap: five.

*Five more deaths*, Lilith calculated, *and she's killed more than she's saved—by her own arithmetic.*

Wei sat alone in the temple aid station, the ledger open before her. The candle provided barely enough light to read by. Outside, the siege continued—it had been continuing for years now, the rhythm of assault and bombardment as familiar as weather—but inside, there was something approaching silence.

Lilith watched her trace the numbers with one finger. The running totals. The careful arithmetic that had once seemed to measure something important and now seemed to measure only her capacity for self-deception.

"Fifteen," Wei said aloud, to no one.

She was referring to a list she'd made. Fifteen people she had personally saved who were still alive. Fifteen out of all the people she'd treated, all the wounds she'd bound, all the fevers she'd cooled and bones she'd set. Fifteen remained.

She had decided to check on them. To find them, wherever they were in the city, and confirm that they still lived.

Lilith felt something stir—not a strategic thought, exactly, but something older. A whisper of warning she'd learned to recognize over the course of many lifetimes.

*If she visits them. If she confirms they're alive. Some ember of faith might rekindle.*

She reached into the fabric of circumstance. Adjusted.

A fever here. A structural weakness there. An assignment to the dangerous sector of the wall.

Over the next three days of Wei's subjective time—and perhaps an hour of Lilith's—twelve of the fifteen died.

Wei found the bodies. Or heard the news. Or stood at the edge of mass graves and counted.

Her ledger:

*133 saved. 142 lost.*

She had killed more than she'd saved.

Winter 1863-1864.

Wei's ledger lay closed in a drawer. She hadn't updated it in months.

*She's stopped counting*, Lilith noted. *That means she's stopped believing the counts matter.*

The theological framework had collapsed—Lilith could feel its absence like a missing tooth. Where there had been certainty, there was now silence. Where there had been prayer, there was only breathing.

And yet—

Wei continued to treat the wounded.

Lilith frowned.

She couldn't find the break she'd expected. The woman had lost her faith, lost her ledger, lost the theological framework that had sustained her for eight years. But she still showed up. Still moved through the triage. Still bound wounds and set bones and sometimes, with her knife, ended suffering.

*Why?*

It was a question Lilith had learned to distrust. This soul had a history of surprising her at exactly the moments when victory seemed assured. But she couldn't see what Wei was holding onto. The determination seemed genuinely hollow.

*Perhaps*, she thought, *I should wait and see.*

But the pressure remained. The weight of eons. The certainty that only one of them could complete.

She continued watching.
