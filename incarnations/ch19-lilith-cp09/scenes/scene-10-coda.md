# Scene 10: Coda — The Approach Begins

Three weeks later.

Lilith sat in the same corner of her flat, but everything had changed.

The tracking notebooks had been organized, dated, filed. They were history now—a record of eight years of observation and intervention. She would refer to them if needed, but their primary purpose was complete. The forward scan was done.

The new notebook—the proximity project—was filling rapidly.

She had submitted applications to four university positions. Two were clinical appointments, the kind of student-support work that she was qualified for but had never particularly wanted. One was a research fellowship—consciousness studies, naturally—that would put her in the same building as the philosophy department. The fourth was more speculative: a guest lectureship on clinical approaches to meditation, proposed to a continuing education program that sometimes cross-listed with Silas's department.

Any of them would work. All of them would give her access.

She had written cover letters in the precise, slightly distanced voice she'd perfected over fifteen years of professional correspondence. She had attached CVs that emphasized her meditation research, her publications on mindfulness-based interventions, her theoretical interest in contemplative traditions. Everything was true. Everything was also strategic.

The NHS position was ending. She'd formally resigned two weeks ago—a relief to everyone, probably, though Dr. Whitmore had managed a convincing impression of regret. Her clinical caseload was being redistributed. Her office would be reassigned. By the end of the month, she would be officially unemployed.

*And free*, she thought, looking at the applications. *Free to do what needs to be done.*

But even that framing—*needs to be done*—felt less certain than it once had. The urgency remained, but it had become complicated by the doubts she'd been accumulating. The backfire pattern. The questions about mutual exclusion. The strange ache she'd felt watching Wei die.

Her mobile rang. She glanced at it—Nadia—and considered not answering. But some habits were difficult to break, and her sister's persistence had only grown since the wedding.

"Hello?"

"You sound distracted." Nadia's voice was warm despite the assessment. "Where are you?"

"Home. Working."

"You're always working." The concern in Nadia's voice was familiar—she'd been expressing it for years, with increasing frequency. "Mum's worried about you. I'm worried about you. Are you still on that... research project?"

*Research project.* Nadia's euphemism for whatever she thought Lilith was actually doing with the notebooks, the absences, the gradual withdrawal from ordinary life.

"The research is complete," Lilith said. "I found what I was looking for."

There was a pause. "That's... good? Is that good?"

"It means I can move to the next phase."

Another pause, longer this time. "Lily." Nadia's nickname for her, rarely used. "I don't understand what you're doing. I've never understood. You used to tell me things—remember? Before all this. We used to talk."

Something stirred in Lilith's chest. Not quite guilt. Something more like recognition—recognition of what she'd let erode in the name of her pursuit.

"I know," she said, and her voice was gentler than she'd intended. "I'm sorry. I wish I could explain."

"Then explain."

The temptation was almost overwhelming. Tell Nadia everything. The tracking. The soul she'd been following through eons. The threshold approaching, the question of whether two beings could complete together. Let someone else carry part of this weight.

But Nadia couldn't understand. Even if she believed—which she wouldn't—she couldn't see what Lilith saw. The knowledge would just become one more thing separating them.

And there was someone who might understand. Someone who could see what she saw, or something close to it.

"I'm changing jobs," Lilith said instead. "Moving to university work. Manchester. I'll be around more."

"That's... good." Nadia didn't sound convinced. "For how long?"

*Until I understand what I've been missing*, Lilith thought. *Until I know whether what I've believed for eons is actually true.*

"For the foreseeable future," she said.

They talked for a few more minutes—Nadia's husband, Nadia's job, the holiday plans Nadia wanted Lilith to attend. Surface conversation, the kind they'd been reduced to. When they hung up, Lilith sat for a long moment with the phone in her hand, feeling the weight of everything she couldn't say.

*He's the only one who might understand.*

The thought came again, and this time she didn't fight it.

Silas Pahlavan. Philosophy lecturer. Consciousness researcher. Meditator approaching the threshold.

If she told him what she knew—what she'd seen, what she'd done, what she understood about the wheel and the threshold and the question that had been driving her for eons—he might actually *get it*. He was the only person on Earth who had a chance of comprehending what she'd been carrying alone for a decade.

*But not yet*, she reminded herself. *First proximity. First understanding. First see what I've been unable to see from a distance.*

She would get close. She would build trust. She would become... what? Important to him. Essential. Real.

And somewhere in that process, she might learn something that changed everything.

The notebooks held ten years of watching him die.

Now she would watch him live.

And find out—finally—whether what she'd believed about their paths was true.

She set down the phone. She opened the laptop. She began drafting a follow-up email for one of the university positions—the research fellowship, the one that would put her closest to his department.

*This is research*, she told herself.

*Proximity for observation. Trust for access. Relationship for understanding.*

But beneath the strategy, something else was forming. Something that had been forming since she'd watched Wei treat a child in a dying kingdom and realized that the trying was never nothing.

Something that felt less like opposition and more like... recognition.

She didn't name it. She wasn't ready.

But it was there.
