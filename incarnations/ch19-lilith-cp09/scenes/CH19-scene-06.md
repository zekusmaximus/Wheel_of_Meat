The thread continued.

Wei's last thought—*I will try again*—became seed, became pattern, became the karmic momentum that pulled consciousness forward through death and the between-space and into whatever form awaited. Lilith followed it. Had to follow it. The compulsion that had driven her through Tianjing's siege drove her now through the tracking, through the tracing, through the need to know where the pattern surfaced next and whether she had time to prevent it or whether the wheel had already turned past the point where prevention was possible.

The thread moved forward from 1864. She moved with it.

Glimpses:

A face in Bombay, 1891. Child dying of cholera. The consciousness she recognized flickering in eyes that would close before age five. Gone before the pattern could develop. She barely registered it—there and past, a life too brief to track, the wheel turning through forms like water through cupped hands.

A woman in Chicago, 1923. Nurse. The helping impulse strong but truncated by tuberculosis before middle age. Lilith watched her die coughing blood into white cloth and felt the thread pull forward again, barely pausing, the pattern not yet ready to crystallize.

Again. Again. The thread surfacing and submerging, forms taken and released, the consciousness she tracked appearing in fragments across decades she didn't count because counting implied she could hold the vastness when the truth was it exceeded her, had always exceeded her, the many times and many deaths blurring into pattern rather than staying discrete as memory.

She'd watched him die. Over and over. In forms she hadn't documented, in eras between the significant lives, in the spaces where the pattern tested itself without achieving, where the wheel turned without the friction that would slow it enough for lessons to crystallize into perfections.

Her exhaustion was deeper than nine attempts. Deeper than ten. The weight of it pressed through her awareness—how many times had she seen this consciousness flicker and fail, surface and submerge, reach toward something it could not yet grasp?

Too many. Always too many.

The thread accelerated toward present. The glimpses between became flashes—faster, briefer, the karmic momentum building toward the life that would matter, that would hold the pattern long enough for what Wei had seeded to grow.

And then: Manchester.

The thread arrived in present tense. In now. In the rain that was still falling against her windows, the autumn that was still dying around her flat, the city that held her and held him in the same geography, the same moment, the same breath.

Him.

Alive. Close. The presence she'd been tracking condensed into location, into direction, into the pull that had been building beneath her interventions for longer than she'd admitted.

The university. Philosophy department. A name she didn't know yet but could find, a face she would recognize when she saw it though it would be different from all the others—Wei's face, the woman in Chicago's face, the child in Bombay's face—because faces changed but the pattern underneath was constant.

*Silas Pahlavan.*

The name arrived with the location, attached to the presence the way a label attaches to something already known. She tested it silently, felt how it fit the pattern she'd been tracking. Different from Wei Shufen, from Jean de Langon, from all the previous names. But the consciousness underneath—that was constant.

She would know him when she found him.

Relief crashed through her like water breaking a dam—months of tracking, centuries of history, nine catastrophic interventions, and finally she knew where he was. Present day. Manchester. Close enough that the pull had weight, had direction, had the quality of inevitability she'd felt since that first moment tracking Ka and recognizing something she couldn't name.

*I've found him.*

And then, beneath the relief: terror.

Not the word she used. She called it strategic concern. But the sensation was older than strategy, rawer than calculation. She had found him—but she did not know how close he was.

The thread showed location. It did not show spiritual status. Did not reveal whether Wei's final achievement—the outcome-independent determination, the release she'd accidentally caused—would manifest immediately in this life or whether there would be lag, breathing room, time to position before he crossed where she could not follow.

She could sense him but not measure him. Knew where he was but not how close he was to stream-entry. Did not know whether she had months or weeks or days before he crossed.

*What if I'm already too late?*

The question arrived with the precision of a diagnosis. Her hands gripped the chair arms—the ache in her chest from Wei's death still phantom-present, still unexplained—and she felt both things at once: the relief of finding, the terror of not knowing.

He could be one significant choice from crossing. Could have already crossed. Could be years away. She had no way to tell from location alone, and the thread offered proximity but not proximity-to-threshold.

*I need more data.*

The thought crystallized with desperate certainty. Track his immediate past life—Jack Malone, Los Angeles, 1930s. That death would tell her where he was in the process, how close to crossing, whether the race she felt in the architecture was measured in months or weeks or days.

But there was something else beneath the urgency.

A pressure in the architecture itself.

She felt it now—had been feeling it build across the tracking, across the interventions, across the years she'd spent leaning into his thread. Not doctrine read in texts but pattern experienced in structure: two souls approaching the same threshold. Two presences in the space where there was only room for one.

Or not room. Not quite.

The pressure wasn't scarcity. It was interference. Crowding. Like two frequencies too close together creating distortion, or two flames that would extinguish each other if they didn't—

She cut off the thought.

The race had crystallized. That was what mattered. The feeling of running out of room, of the threshold narrowing, of her own practice sharpening not from wisdom but from the structural necessity of two approaching the same door.

Only one can achieve.

The phrase arrived without source, without doctrine to support it, just the weight of pattern felt in her awareness. She didn't question it. Questioning would require examining the pressure itself, the interference, the reason two souls approaching created problem rather than something else, some other configuration she couldn't name because naming would require seeing what she refused to see.

Filed it. The race was real. The pressure was real. The need to reach him first was real.

The pull toward him exceeded all of it.

That was what frightened her, though she did not call it fear. The way the tracking had become pursuit had become hunger had become something that felt less like competition and more like gravity, like water finding water, like the specific recognition of missing piece approaching completion.

She was walking toward him the way water walks toward the sea.

But she called it positioning. Called it strategic necessity. Called it the logical next move after nine historical interventions had failed and only present-day engagement remained.

The thread glowed in her awareness: Manchester, the university, philosophy, him.

Alive. Approachable. Close enough that the pull had weight, had direction, had the quality of inevitability she'd felt since that first moment tracking Ka's thread and recognizing something she couldn't name.

Tianjing was fully receded now. Smoke smell gone. Artillery memory faded. The violence of war replaced by Manchester's violence of calm—institutional waiting rooms, application forms, the slow grinding of bureaucratic systems that would give her access to his world if she moved correctly, if she positioned precisely, if she approached with the competence that had always sustained her.

She could do this. She was good at this. Clinical work, student mental health, the job that would place her on campus with legitimate reason to be in spaces where philosophy professors existed, where chance meetings could be arranged, where acquaintance could be made.

But first she needed to know: how close was he?

The thread showed her present location, showed her he was alive, showed her the pull was real. It did not show her how close. Did not show her whether he had weeks or months, whether Wei's final achievement would manifest immediately or whether there would be delay, time to position before he crossed.

She would need to track backward one life. Not Wei—the life immediately prior to now. The one that would tell her where he was in the process, how close to crossing, whether she had time or whether time had already run out.

The detective. Los Angeles. 1930s. Jack Malone.

While making Silas's acquaintance, she would track Jack. Simultaneous observation: the past-life pattern revealing spiritual proximity while the present-life engagement began.

Chapter 21. The pivot in action. The intimacy strategy crystallizing.

But first: positioning.

She had to secure the job, establish presence, become part of the university's landscape in a way that made meeting him natural rather than contrived.

The rain had stopped. She hadn't noticed when. The flat was darker—afternoon having shifted toward evening while she'd been tracing forward, the autumn light failing earlier each day.

She stood. The motion felt strange after hours of stillness, her body protesting the return to ordinary gravity after the sustained tracking that had compressed timelines into superposition.

Manchester was solid around her. Real. Present. The violence of calm waiting.

And somewhere in this city, he was waiting too.

Not waiting for her. He didn't know she existed. Didn't know he'd died endless times with her watching. Didn't know the pattern that connected them exceeded intervention, exceeded competition, exceeded even the race that had her moving toward him with urgency that felt like need.

She would find him. Would position herself. Would begin the work that historical intervention had failed to accomplish.

The wheel turned. The pattern continued.

And the pull toward him that she would not name grew stronger with proximity, with certainty, with the recognition her body knew and her mind refused.

Not examined. Not yet. Not ever.

The work continued.
