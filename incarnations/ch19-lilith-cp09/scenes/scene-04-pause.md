# Scene 4: The Pause — June 1864

Hong Xiuquan died on June 1, 1864.

Lilith learned of it the way she learned everything during extended tracking—as a kind of doubled awareness, information arriving from Wei's perspective and from the larger context she couldn't help but absorb.

The Heavenly King had swallowed poison, or perhaps starved, or perhaps simply died of whatever sickness had been consuming him for months. The official story was unclear. The unofficial story was that the man who had declared himself the younger brother of Jesus Christ, who had built a kingdom on visions and carved it from the flesh of millions, had ended his life rather than watch it fall.

Wei received the news at dawn.

Lilith watched her face as the messenger delivered it. Watched the careful absence of reaction—the discipline of years making itself visible in the stillness of her features. Wei listened. She nodded. She asked two questions about the disposition of the body and the chain of command. Then she dismissed the messenger and sat down on an empty pallet in the aid station.

She didn't move for two days.

*This is it*, Lilith thought. But the thought carried less certainty than it would have years ago.

The siege continued around Wei's stillness. The workers in the aid station—fewer now, many dead, others fled—moved around her as if she were furniture. They stopped asking her questions. They stopped expecting her to help.

She sat. She breathed. She did nothing.

*The structure has collapsed*, Lilith assessed. *Hong's death was the final load-bearing element. Without the theology, without the divine kingdom, without the purpose that justified the suffering—she has nothing left to hold onto.*

But even as she formed the assessment, she doubted it. She had made similar assessments before. In the seventh incarnation, when she'd engineered the collapse of the philosopher's support network. In the eighth, when she'd amplified the persecution beyond what any faith should be able to absorb. Each time, she had believed the structure was broken.

Each time, something else had emerged from the breaking.

She began making notes—internal notes, the kind that would later become entries in her Manchester notebooks—but they were cautious now. *Intervention timeline: approximately two years. Method: circumstantial manipulation targeting outcome-attachment. Preliminary result: complete theological collapse.*

No word yet on whether the collapse would hold.

Wei sat on the pallet, staring at nothing. Outside, artillery continued its rhythm. Lilith felt herself beginning to withdraw, preparing to track forward to the next incarnation.

*Confirm the pattern holds*, she thought. *Find the twentieth-century waypoint. The detective. The final passage before the present.*

She was already beginning the detachment—loosening her observation, letting Wei's perspective fade back into the general texture of the tracking—when she noticed something.

Wei's hands had moved.

Not much. A small gesture, fingers adjusting against her knees. The kind of movement that could mean nothing.

Lilith paused her withdrawal. Watched.

Wei's eyes, which had been fixed on some middle distance, began to focus. Her gaze tracked across the aid station—the pallets, the wounded, the few workers still moving. Something was happening behind that face.

*Nothing*, Lilith decided. *She's just returning to awareness. The withdrawal took two days; now she's emerging.*

But she didn't fully withdraw. Some instinct—honed by eight interventions and eight surprises—made her wait.

Wei stood up.

She crossed to the nearest pallet, where a soldier was dying of infection. His wound had been treated days ago, before Hong's death, but the infection had set in anyway. He was delirious, sweating, moving in and out of consciousness.

Wei knelt beside him.

*Muscle memory*, Lilith told herself. *Habit. The body continuing what the soul has abandoned. It doesn't mean the determination has reformed.*

But some part of her was no longer certain.
