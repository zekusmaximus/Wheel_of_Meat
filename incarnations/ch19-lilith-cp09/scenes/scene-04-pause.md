The third day of Wei's paralysis arrived like the others: artillery at dawn, smoke rising, the siege grinding forward with the inevitability of stone wearing smooth under water. Two days he'd sat idle. Two days he'd refused patients. Two days Lilith had watched and called it success while the pressure in her chest refused to dissipate.

This is it, she thought. The pattern worked. Futility visible. Determination breaking.

The child stumbled through the temple entrance just after noon.

Boy. Seven or eight years old—malnutrition made aging guesswork. Shrapnel wound in his left arm, bleeding steady but not arterial. Survivable if treated. Fatal if ignored. The kind of injury Wei had handled hundreds of times, the kind that required twenty minutes of work and would save a life or end one depending on whether someone acted.

The boy stood in the doorway, bleeding. Wei sat in the alcove, motionless.

Both of them suspended in the moment before choice became action, before the pattern that had held for two years either completed or shattered.

Lilith leaned forward—Manchester and Tianjing both—and the motion was hunger, was certainty, was two years of sustained intervention converging on this single instant. Don't, she thought, willing it across centuries. You've learned. The futility is visible. Everyone you save dies. You are the curse. Don't reach. Don't help. Let this one go and break the pattern that's destroying you.

Wei's eyes met the boy's.

The child's face was gray with shock. His arm hung wrong. Blood dripped from his fingertips onto temple stone, each drop a small percussion, a countdown, a question demanding answer.

Wei stared at him. The boy stared back.

Long moment. Everything balanced.

In Manchester, Lilith's hands gripped the arms of her chair, knuckles white. The rain had shifted—harder now, autumn storm accelerating, the sound building from steady percussion to something closer to violence. She didn't notice. Her entire awareness was focused on Tianjing, on Wei, on the choice crystallizing in the space between paralysis and action.

Two days idle. Two days confronting the arithmetic: everyone he'd saved had died. The ledger inverted. The curse spreading. The logical conclusion was cessation—stop helping, stop being the variable that turned survival into deferred death, stop reaching toward suffering as if reaching mattered.

The boy swayed. Shock deepening. Blood loss mounting. Another minute and he'd collapse, and then the choice would resolve itself because unconscious bodies were easier to ignore than eyes asking wordless questions.

Wei reached for his tools.

No, Lilith thought. The word arrived sharp and immediate, the first time in two years she'd felt alarm rather than satisfaction, the first crack in the certainty that had sustained her through sustained intervention. No, you're supposed to stop. You learned. The pattern showed you. I made futility visible. Why are you—

Wei's hands closed around needle and thread.

The boy's eyes stayed fixed on him. Trusting. Desperate. Unaware that the man reaching toward him was curse disguised as cure, that survival might only be postponement, that the pattern suggested this help would doom rather than save.

Wei did not know this would work. Did not believe it would work. Two years and two days of evidence argued otherwise. But the boy was bleeding now, and Wei knew how to stop bleeding, and the gap between knowledge and action collapsed into the simple fact of need meeting capacity.

He gestured. The boy approached.

Lilith watched it happen—the moment she'd spent two years preventing, the choice she'd made impossible made anyway. Wei kneeling beside the child. Tools laid out. Hands steady despite everything. The determination she'd tried to break crystallizing instead, purifying, becoming outcome-independent in the instant he chose to help knowing it was futile.

The temple held them both: man and child, physician and patient, cursor and cursed.

Outside, artillery continued. Rain continued. The siege ground forward.

And Wei began to work.
