# Scene 1: The Method

The notebooks surrounded her in concentric rings, their spines cracked from use, their margins dense with her handwriting. The earliest ones—from that first year when the awareness had bloomed unbidden—were almost illegible now, the ink faded, the paper soft from handling. The recent ones maintained their clinical precision. Progress, she supposed. Or repetition disguised as refinement.

Lilith sat cross-legged in the corner of her flat that had ceased to be a corner and become, over eight years, a command center. She had not opened the curtains in days. The Manchester dawn struggled through anyway, milk-grey light filtering around the edges, the particular color of English winter mornings that seemed designed to make urgency feel foolish.

Three coffee cups on the floor beside her, their contents at various stages of abandonment. The flat smelled of stale grounds and the particular staleness of a space whose inhabitant had been elsewhere—not physically, but attentionally—for too long.

Her body knew this posture. Eight years of returning to this corner, this position, these notebooks. She had read once about monks who sat so long their knees wore grooves in temple floors. The comparison would once have amused her. Now it merely described.

She opened the notebook labeled *Forward Scan: Year Eight*.

The technique had evolved. That first accidental glimpse in her twenty-fifth year—the dying man in ancient waters, the face that wasn't a face but somehow was—had grown into something she could almost control. The key was death. Not her own, but his. Each time he died, the soul's passage created a signature she could follow. Like tracing the path of a river by the sediment it deposited, the traces clearest at the moment of transition.

*Follow the transitions*, she had written three years ago. *Map the trajectory.*

It worked. It worked imperfectly, with gaps she couldn't fill and connections she was forced to infer, but it worked. She had traced him backward to the primordial—that protohuman who had first touched something she recognized as kin. She had traced him forward through Egypt, Rome, Athens, medieval Spain. Each death a waypoint. Each life a data point.

Her own face in the tracking—when she glimpsed her past incarnations in the peripheral awareness that sometimes accompanied deep observation—was always the same. The widow's peak. The dark strand falling left. The particular way light caught the crescent in her left eye.

His face changed every time.

She had never wondered why. The observation filed itself away, a detail that seemed to mean nothing.

And now, after a year of intensive work, she had nearly completed the forward scan.

She was close. Close enough to feel him. Not in the tracking way, not in the awareness that let her observe his past lives, but in a different register entirely. A presence in the world. A weight on the same scale where she stood.

*He's here*, she had written last month, underlining it twice. *Somewhere in this timeline. This city, possibly. I can feel the terminus of the thread.*

Today she would observe the Taiping incarnation. The last major waypoint before the modern era. After that, a brief scan through the mid-twentieth century, and then—

Then she would find him.

Her NHS position had thinned to something barely defensible. Colleagues had stopped asking if she was all right; they had learned to read her absence even when she was present. She had let it happen. The cosmic scope of what she pursued made ordinary professional concerns feel like children's games played by the side of a roaring ocean.

This was the cost of seeing what she saw. Not physical strain—her body remained capable, her mind remained sharp—but the gradual, voluntary withdrawal from everything that didn't matter. And increasingly, only one thing mattered.

She had managed one appointment that morning. The NHS clinic, the truncated schedule she maintained to preserve the appearance of professional continuity. Eleanor Hartley, forty-seven, caregiver exhaustion. Three years attending her mother's decline from Alzheimer's, the slow erosion visible in Eleanor's face, the way her hands moved with the particular tremor of someone running on fumes.

"I know she won't get better," Eleanor had said, staring at the tissue she was methodically shredding. "The doctors have been clear. It's just... maintenance now. Keeping her comfortable. But I can't stop trying to reach her. Every day I try to get her to remember my name. My face. Something."

Lilith had sat with the familiar weight of another person's futility, feeling it settle like sediment.

"And does she?" she'd asked. "Remember?"

"No. Not for months. But I keep trying anyway."

The silence between them had held something Lilith recognized but couldn't name. She'd leaned forward slightly, using the gesture to signal attention, engagement—the practiced choreography of clinical care.

"Sometimes," she'd said, her voice carrying the particular gentleness she'd learned to manufacture, "the meaning isn't in whether you succeed. It's in the trying itself. In the commitment. You're showing up for her even when the outcome is already determined. That has its own value."

Eleanor had looked at her with something like hope, or perhaps just relief at being given permission to continue the impossible.

After the session, Lilith had returned to her desk to write her notes. Her hands had shaken slightly as she held the pen—exhaustion from last night's tracking session, probably. The migraine had started three hours in, pressure behind her left eye, the way peripheral vision fragmented at the edges. She'd taken paracetamol and continued anyway. The pain had faded by dawn but left a residue, the particular emptiness that came from pushing past the body's warnings.

She'd written: *Patient demonstrates persistent effort despite acknowledged futility. Advised reframing success metrics. Prognosis: will continue caregiver role until natural conclusion.*

The irony hadn't registered. Not then. Not sitting in her clinic office with Eleanor's gratitude still warm in the air. She'd filed the notes, cleared her desk, and returned to the flat where the real work waited.

The transition was easier now than it had been. That first year, she'd fought against the dissolution of ordinary perception, uncertain what she was becoming. Now she simply... allowed it. Like releasing a held breath. The releasing was almost relief.

Her flat receded. Not vanished—she could still feel the floor beneath her, the cool morning air on her skin—but it became distant. Secondary. A fading signal beneath a stronger one.

Time became porous.

She reached backward through the thread she'd been following, feeling for the death that preceded him. The Renaissance skeptic—Jean, she'd learned, though names rarely mattered—had died on a road in France, refusing to offer certainty he didn't possess. His death had the particular brightness of alignment, that clean quality she'd learned to recognize when someone died integrated with whatever they truly were. The soul had passed onward, carrying what it had learned, seeding what would come next.

And what came next was this: China. 1862. A kingdom falling, a faith fracturing, a healer who couldn't stop trying to save people she knew she couldn't save.

She let herself drift forward along the thread. The texture changed—different century, different geography, different constraints. Where the Renaissance thread had tasted of uncertainty transmuted into principle, this one tasted of determination still contaminated by hope. She believed, this incarnation. Believed in the divine kingdom she was dying to protect. Believed that her healing hands served a purpose beyond their immediate use.

Lilith felt the familiar recognition—not pleasure exactly, but something closer to professional regard. This was a worthy configuration. Determination attached to outcomes. The kind of structure that could, with precise intervention, be shown its own limits.

The thread stabilized. She felt herself settling into observation—not inhabitation, not yet, but presence. She could see without being seen. She could watch without participating.

Though after eight years, she'd learned that watching always became participating. Every observation was also an intervention. Every attention she paid created ripples she couldn't fully control.

She understood this. She understood, too, the deeper irony—that her interventions had never once produced the result she intended. Eight years. Eight attempts. Eight backfires.

And still she continued. This was its own lesson, though she couldn't quite read it.

She opened herself to 1862.

Spring. Siege conditions. A temple converted to an aid station.

And him. Her. The one she followed.

Wei Shufen. A woman this time—interesting. She'd noted early that the soul's gender wasn't fixed, though in her observation it tended to cluster around certain presentations more than others. This version was female, early thirties, Hakka ethnicity. Lüshuai rank—captain, in Western terms. Medical training gained somewhere informal but effective.

She was treating wounded soldiers at dawn.

Lilith watched, feeling the familiar settling of observation into position. Like sliding into the role she'd learned over a decade of practice. Witness. Analyst. The one who saw what was truly at stake.

*Let's see what you're carrying*, she thought at the woman who moved efficiently among the bleeding men, her hands steady, her face expressionless in a way that spoke of long practice.

*Let's see how deep the attachment runs.*

# Scene 2: The Observation — Spring 1862

The siege sounds were muffled by distance and the thick walls of the converted temple, but Wei Shufen's hands knew when artillery was coming. They would pause, just slightly, over whatever wound she was treating. Not stopping. Never stopping. But acknowledging, in the grammar of the body, that the world outside was actively trying to kill everything she was working to save.

Lilith observed from the strange angle that tracking provided—neither inside Wei's head nor entirely outside it. She could see what Wei saw, feel something of what Wei felt, but it remained separate. Like watching a performance in a language she knew well but had not been born speaking.

The aid station occupied what had once been a Buddhist temple. The icons had been removed—the Taiping faith permitted no idols—but something of the space's original purpose lingered in the proportions of the room, the quality of light through high windows, the way sound moved. Sick and wounded men lay on straw pallets arranged in rows. There were perhaps forty of them. By Lilith's count, at least twelve would be dead within a week regardless of treatment.

Wei moved among them with an efficiency that bordered on ruthlessness. Triage by touch: a hand on a forehead, a glance at bandages, the quick assessment of who could be saved, who was already dead, and who occupied the brutal middle ground of dying too slowly to ignore but too certainly to prioritize.

*She counts*, Lilith noted with something approaching respect. Clinical as diagnosis.

And she did count. Every patient Wei treated, every outcome—survival or death—was entered into a small ledger she kept tucked in her waistband. Lilith watched her update it after each round of treatment. Careful notation. Running totals. The arithmetic of triage.

*48 saved. 23 lost.*

The numbers themselves meant little—context shifted their significance—but the act of counting was the tell. This was a woman who believed the numbers mattered. Who needed to know whether she was winning or losing.

*Outcome attachment*, Lilith assessed. *Believes the ledger measures something real about her merit.*

She felt no contempt for this. She understood it too well. The soul's development always passed through this phase—the phase where actions were weighed against results, where generosity was measured by gratitude received, where determination was validated by success achieved. It was attachment, yes. But it was also a necessary station along the path.

The theological framework was obvious. Taiping Christianity—that strange hybrid of Hong Xiuquan's visions and whatever Protestant missionary material had reached him—wrapped everything in divine purpose. Wei wasn't just treating wounded; she was participating in God's work. Every soldier saved was a soul preserved for the Heavenly Kingdom. Every death was... what? A mystery. A test. A failure she would need to answer for.

Lilith watched her pray before treating a soldier whose gut wound had turned septic. Quick words, almost silent, the gesture of hands pressed together and then opened toward the work ahead. The prayer did nothing medically. The soldier died that afternoon, his peritonitis unstoppable by nineteenth-century methods.

Wei recorded the death in her ledger. *24 lost.*

She didn't adjust her faith. That was what made this incarnation both admirable and dangerous. The death became a data point in a theology that could absorb any data point, that could interpret any outcome as part of God's plan. Wei's certainty wasn't fragile. It was pliable. It could bend around any fact without breaking.

*The determination is genuine*, Lilith observed. *The contamination is in the outcomes—in believing the ledger tells her something about where she stands with the divine.*

She expanded her observation, letting herself feel more of Wei's internal state. It was always a risk—the closer she got, the more the observation became participation—but she needed to understand the architecture of this soul's current configuration before she decided how to proceed.

What she found was... complex.

Wei Shufen was thirty-two years old. Hakka by birth, which meant outsider by definition—a member of the guest people who had migrated southward centuries ago and never quite belonged. She had learned medicine from her grandmother, a bone-setter and herbalist. When the Taiping rebellion reached her village, she had joined not from revolutionary fervor but from calculation: the Taiping treated women as something approaching human. They could fight, lead, own property, refuse husbands. Compared to the Qing alternative, it was barely a choice.

The faith had come later. Genuine conversion, Lilith assessed—not the performance of conviction. Something in Hong Xiuquan's wild theology had spoken to a hunger Wei hadn't known she carried. The idea that this suffering world would be transformed. That the Heavenly Kingdom was not metaphor but coming reality.

Eight years later, with the kingdom collapsing, Wei still believed.

*Contaminated determination*, Lilith thought, crystallizing her assessment. *She helps because it's God's work. She endures because divine reward awaits. If those props were removed...*

She paused.

If those props were removed, what would remain?

This was the question she had been working for eight years. Across seven incarnations, she had intervened—subtly, then less subtly, then with every capacity she could access. And every time, the result had been... not what she expected.

The props fell. The soul remained. More: the soul *strengthened*.

Was it possible the props weren't structural? That removing them didn't collapse the determination but purified it?

The question unsettled her in a way she didn't fully understand. She filed it for later.

She watched Wei set a young soldier's broken arm, working quickly, her hands sure despite the sweat on her forehead. The soldier was perhaps nineteen. He'd been crushed when a wall collapsed during the last assault. His arm would heal, probably. He would return to active duty within a month.

*And then?*

The thought arrived unbidden, and Lilith recognized it as something new. Not strategy. Not calculation. Something more like... curiosity. About what would happen if she didn't intervene at all. If she simply watched.

But she couldn't simply watch. Could she?

*Together doesn't hold.* The phrase from some deep memory, some awareness that predated her current life. Only one of them could complete. If she did nothing, he would continue. And if he completed first...

She felt the familiar pressure—not physical, but something deeper. The weight of eons of work. The cost of letting it slip away.

And so she began, very carefully, to slip tendrils of causation through the fabric of 1862.

# Scene 3: The Intervention

Time moved strangely during extended tracking. Lilith had learned to stop fighting the temporal distortion, to accept that hours in 1862 might correspond to minutes in her Manchester flat or—she'd discovered once, to her disquiet—to three full days of lost time that she couldn't account for afterward.

This was the cost. Not physical strain—her body bore it well enough—but *attentional* cost. Hours or days vanished from her ordinary life while she was present elsewhere. Her career, her relationships, her connection to anything that wasn't this—all of it eroded not through exhaustion but through absence. She chose this erosion. That distinction mattered to her, though she wasn't sure it should.

She let the intervention unfold across what felt like weeks but was probably less subjective time than that. The manipulations she'd set in motion required patience. Small causes; large effects. The same precision she would apply to any complex system, informed by decades of study and centuries of awareness.

Summer 1862.

Wei's ledger read: *71 saved. 58 lost.*

The gap was closing.

Lilith observed from her usual strange angle, watching Wei treat a mass casualty event. Thirty-two wounded from a single breach in the northern wall. The Qing forces had gotten closer this time, holding their position long enough to do real damage before the Taiping defenders pushed them back.

Wei worked through the triage with her characteristic efficiency, but something had changed in her face. A tightness around the eyes that hadn't been there in spring. A pause, barely perceptible, before each touch—as if she were bracing herself for what she might find.

*She's starting to notice the pattern*, Lilith thought.

The numbers told a story Wei couldn't ignore. Patients she'd saved in spring were dying in summer. The young soldier with the broken arm had caught typhoid from contaminated water—water that Lilith had carefully arranged to be contaminated—and had died sweating and delirious within a week of returning to his unit. A family Wei had evacuated to a safer neighborhood had returned when the fighting shifted, only to be killed when artillery struck their temporary lodgings.

The artillery had been aiming for a different target. Lilith had adjusted its timing by approximately four seconds.

She observed her own work with the clinical detachment of a surgeon reviewing an operation. Small adjustments. Untraceable causes. The butterfly's wing, applied with precision.

But something in her sat uneasily with the work. She recognized the feeling from earlier interventions—the seventh and eighth in particular, when she had begun to suspect that her methods were producing the opposite of their intended effects. She filed the unease and continued.

Fall 1862.

Wei's ledger read: *103 saved. 97 lost.*

Nearly even.

The theological framework was straining visibly now. Hong Xiuquan's sermons—delivered through increasingly erratic channels as the Heavenly King retreated into visions and pronouncements—spoke of divine protection, of suffering purified by faith, of victory guaranteed by God's word.

Wei knelt through the services, her hands folded correctly, her responses timed properly. But Lilith, observing from her strange angle, could feel the hollowness spreading.

*She still prays*, Lilith noted. *But the prayers have stopped being conversation. They've become ritual.*

Spring 1863.

Wei's ledger read: *133 saved. 128 lost.*

The gap: five.

*Five more deaths*, Lilith calculated, *and she's killed more than she's saved—by her own arithmetic.*

Wei sat alone in the temple aid station, the ledger open before her. The candle provided barely enough light to read by. Outside, the siege continued—it had been continuing for years now, the rhythm of assault and bombardment as familiar as weather—but inside, there was something approaching silence.

Lilith watched her trace the numbers with one finger. The running totals. The careful arithmetic that had once seemed to measure something important and now seemed to measure only her capacity for self-deception.

"Fifteen," Wei said aloud, to no one.

She was referring to a list she'd made. Fifteen people she had personally saved who were still alive. Fifteen out of all the people she'd treated, all the wounds she'd bound, all the fevers she'd cooled and bones she'd set. Fifteen remained.

She had decided to check on them. To find them, wherever they were in the city, and confirm that they still lived.

Lilith felt something stir—not a strategic thought, exactly, but something older. A whisper of warning she'd learned to recognize over the course of many lifetimes.

*If she visits them. If she confirms they're alive. Some ember of faith might rekindle.*

She reached into the fabric of circumstance. Adjusted.

A fever here. A structural weakness there. An assignment to the dangerous sector of the wall.

Over the next three days of Wei's subjective time—and perhaps an hour of Lilith's—twelve of the fifteen died.

Wei found the bodies. Or heard the news. Or stood at the edge of mass graves and counted.

Her ledger:

*133 saved. 142 lost.*

She had killed more than she'd saved.

Winter 1863-1864.

Wei's ledger lay closed in a drawer. She hadn't updated it in months.

*She's stopped counting*, Lilith noted. *That means she's stopped believing the counts matter.*

The theological framework had collapsed—Lilith could feel its absence like a missing tooth. Where there had been certainty, there was now silence. Where there had been prayer, there was only breathing.

And yet—

Wei continued to treat the wounded.

Lilith frowned.

She couldn't find the break she'd expected. The woman had lost her faith, lost her ledger, lost the theological framework that had sustained her for eight years. But she still showed up. Still moved through the triage. Still bound wounds and set bones and sometimes, with her knife, ended suffering.

*Why?*

It was a question Lilith had learned to distrust. This soul had a history of surprising her at exactly the moments when victory seemed assured. But she couldn't see what Wei was holding onto. The determination seemed genuinely hollow.

*Perhaps*, she thought, *I should wait and see.*

But the pressure remained. The weight of eons. The certainty that only one of them could complete.

She continued watching.

# Scene 4: The Pause — June 1864

Hong Xiuquan died on June 1, 1864.

Lilith learned of it the way she learned everything during extended tracking—as a kind of doubled awareness, information arriving from Wei's perspective and from the larger context she couldn't help but absorb.

The Heavenly King had swallowed poison, or perhaps starved, or perhaps simply died of whatever sickness had been consuming him for months. The official story was unclear. The unofficial story was that the man who had declared himself the younger brother of Jesus Christ, who had built a kingdom on visions and carved it from the flesh of millions, had ended his life rather than watch it fall.

Wei received the news at dawn.

Lilith watched her face as the messenger delivered it. Watched the careful absence of reaction—the discipline of years making itself visible in the stillness of her features. Wei listened. She nodded. She asked two questions about the disposition of the body and the chain of command. Then she dismissed the messenger and sat down on an empty pallet in the aid station.

She didn't move for two days.

*This is it*, Lilith thought. But the thought carried less certainty than it would have years ago.

The siege continued around Wei's stillness. The workers in the aid station—fewer now, many dead, others fled—moved around her as if she were furniture. They stopped asking her questions. They stopped expecting her to help.

She sat. She breathed. She did nothing.

*The structure has collapsed*, Lilith assessed. *Hong's death was the final load-bearing element. Without the theology, without the divine kingdom, without the purpose that justified the suffering—she has nothing left to hold onto.*

The aid station reflected the collapse. Word of Hong's death had spread through Tianjing like a contagion more virulent than the diseases Lilith had carefully seeded. Soldiers who had fought with religious fervor now moved with the mechanical numbness of men who knew they were already dead. The wounded stopped asking when reinforcements would come. The few remaining medical workers went through the motions, but something had gone out of their hands—the belief that any of this mattered.

And Wei sat, unmoving, at the center of it all.

Two years of Lilith's work, compressed into this moment. Every patient she'd ensured would die. Every rescue she'd arranged to fail. Every small hope she'd methodically extinguished. The ledger Wei no longer consulted showed the final tally: 133 saved, 142 lost. She had killed more than she'd saved.

Lilith felt satisfaction settle into her chest like a weight finding its proper place.

But even as she formed the assessment, she doubted it. She had made similar assessments before. In the seventh incarnation, when she'd engineered the collapse of the philosopher's support network. In the eighth, when she'd amplified the persecution beyond what any faith should be able to absorb. Each time, she had believed the structure was broken.

Each time, something else had emerged from the breaking.

She began making notes—internal notes, the kind that would later become entries in her Manchester notebooks—but they were cautious now. *Intervention timeline: approximately two years. Method: circumstantial manipulation targeting outcome-attachment. Preliminary result: complete theological collapse.*

No word yet on whether the collapse would hold.

She surfaced to Manchester midnight.

The transition back to her body carried the usual disorientation—the compression of hours into moments, the return to a single timeline after occupying two. Her legs were numb from sitting. The flat was dark except for streetlight filtering through curtains she'd forgotten to close. The radiator ticked in the silence.

She stood, stretching muscles that had been still for too long, and crossed to her desk. The notebook labeled *Taiping Intervention* waited. She opened it to a blank page and began writing in the dim light, not bothering to turn on the lamp.

*June 1, 1864. Hong Xiuquan deceased. Wei Shufen has ceased all medical activity. Preliminary assessment: theological framework collapsed. Outcome-dependent determination appears broken.*

*If this holds—if she remains in stasis—the perfection will not develop fully in this incarnation. The next life may require different intervention. Less sophisticated. Easier to corrupt.*

She paused, pen hovering over the page.

*Eight years. Eight backfires. But this feels different. She's stopped. She's actually stopped.*

The satisfaction returned, warmer now. Two years of meticulous work. Hundreds of small interventions woven into a pattern Wei couldn't see but couldn't escape. And it had worked. Finally, one of her interventions had worked.

She would track forward soon. Find the detective incarnation, confirm its parameters. Then the mid-twentieth century lives, brief and spiritually insignificant. And then—the modern presence she could feel waiting, close enough to touch.

Manchester. He was in Manchester. She was sure of it now.

But first, she needed to confirm Wei's collapse was permanent.

She returned to the tracking corner, lowered herself back into position. The transition was easier the second time—her consciousness still half-present in 1862, the thread still warm from recent attention.

Wei sat on the pallet, staring at nothing. Outside, artillery continued its rhythm. Lilith felt herself settling back into observation, preparing to track forward to the next incarnation.

*Confirm the pattern holds*, she thought. *Find the twentieth-century waypoint. The detective. The final passage before the present.*

She was already beginning the detachment—loosening her observation, letting Wei's perspective fade back into the general texture of the tracking—when she noticed something.

Wei's hands had moved.

Not much. A small gesture, fingers adjusting against her knees. The kind of movement that could mean nothing.

Lilith paused her withdrawal. Watched.

Wei's eyes, which had been fixed on some middle distance, began to focus. Her gaze tracked across the aid station—the pallets, the wounded, the few workers still moving. Something was happening behind that face.

*Nothing*, Lilith decided. *She's just returning to awareness. The withdrawal took two days; now she's emerging.*

But she didn't fully withdraw. Some instinct—honed by eight interventions and eight surprises—made her wait.

Wei stood up.

She crossed to the nearest pallet, where a soldier was dying of infection. His wound had been treated days ago, before Hong's death, but the infection had set in anyway. He was delirious, sweating, moving in and out of consciousness.

Wei knelt beside him.

*Muscle memory*, Lilith told herself. *Habit. The body continuing what the soul has abandoned. It doesn't mean the determination has reformed.*

But some part of her was no longer certain.

# Scene 5: The Backfire

The child appeared on the third day.

Lilith hadn't arranged this one. There were limits even to near-full manifestation, and by the final phase of the siege, chaos had become self-sustaining. The city was dying on its own now.

A boy, perhaps seven or eight. Burns on his legs—fire from a collapsed building. His family was nowhere. He had crawled into the aid station alone, following some child-instinct toward the place where hurt people were sometimes made less hurt.

Wei looked at him.

The moment stretched. Lilith could feel something shifting in the architecture of Wei's soul—something tectonic, moving at the foundation level. She couldn't see its shape, not yet, but she could feel the pressure.

*Walk away*, she thought—not as command, but as prediction. *You've stopped. You've given up. There's nothing left to draw on.*

Wei knelt in front of the boy.

"What's your name?" she asked.

The boy said nothing. Shock, perhaps. Or simply nothing left worth saying.

Wei looked at his burns. They were severe but treatable—if treated immediately, if resources were available, if infection could be prevented. All three conditions were unlikely in the final days of Tianjing.

She should walk away. She knew this. Lilith could feel her knowing it—the calculation running beneath the surface, the cold arithmetic of triage. Treating this child would use resources that could save others. And the others would probably die anyway. And the child would probably die anyway. And the walls would fall soon, and everyone would die, and nothing she did in the next hours or days would change that fundamental equation.

Wei began treating his burns.

Lilith felt something move in her own chest—not the Manchester body, not directly, but a translation of something deep. Recognition. And something that felt, strangely, like respect.

*No*, she thought, trying to reframe it. *This is just reflex. This is a healer who can't stop healing. It doesn't mean—*

But she was watching Wei's face, and what she saw there wasn't reflex.

It was choice.

Wei knew. Lilith could feel her knowing. She knew the ledger was inverted, knew everyone she'd saved had died, knew the theology was collapsed and the kingdom was falling and nothing she did would change any of it. She knew that treating this child made no sense, served no purpose, justified no faith.

And she did it anyway.

*I broke her faith*, Lilith thought, but the thought carried less triumph than it once would have. *I shattered her hope. I made futility visible.*

But what she was seeing wasn't faith. It wasn't hope. It wasn't determination contaminated by outcome-attachment.

It was something else.

Wei wrapped the child's burns with clean cloth—cleanish, anyway, nothing was truly clean in Tianjing now. She worked with the same efficiency she'd always had, but the quality was different. She wasn't counting. She wasn't praying. She wasn't calculating whether this would change the ledger.

She was just helping.

*He'll die*, Lilith thought—not as strategy, but as simple observation. *The walls will fall. The Qing will take the city. He'll die with everyone else.*

*And she knows this. And she's helping anyway.*

The child looked up at Wei with something approaching trust. Wei looked back at him without the weight she'd been carrying before. The transaction between them was simple: you are hurt; I can help; I am helping.

Nothing about divine reward. Nothing about outcomes. Nothing about a kingdom that would survive to validate the suffering.

Just: I can help. I am helping.

Lilith watched, and felt the familiar pattern crystallize once more.

Eight interventions now. Eight times she had stripped away the contamination. Eight times she had expected the core to crumble.

Eight times something else had emerged.

The list formed without her willing it:

- Betrayal teaching generosity without reciprocity.
- Isolation concentrating rather than diluting insight.
- Exile becoming space for transformation.
- Pride shown until it could be released.
- Stasis teaching impermanence through horror.
- Hatred purified through suffering.
- Doubt sharpened into truthfulness.
- And now: outcome-attachment broken, leaving determination that needed nothing external.

*I am refining him*, she thought, and the thought carried a weight she hadn't felt before.

Every obstacle she placed became a lesson. Every trap she set became a doorway. Every pressure she applied became exactly the friction needed to polish whatever was ready to be polished.

The pattern was undeniable. Distance didn't cause it—she had varied her distance. Method didn't cause it—she had varied her methods. The only constant was her.

She was the crucible.

And every fire she lit refined rather than destroyed.

Wei finished treating the child. She watched him as he was carried to a clean pallet—cleaner, anyway. She didn't pray. Didn't count. Didn't make any gesture toward a theology that might interpret the outcome.

She just stood there, in the middle of a dying kingdom, having done work that would probably mean nothing.

Her face was clear.

*Is it nothing?* Lilith thought, the question rising before she could suppress it. *Is the work nothing, if the outcome is nothing?*

She had assumed outcomes measured the work. She had assumed that if everyone died anyway, the helping was futile.

But Wei's face didn't look like futility.

Wei's face looked like... release.

*What if the work is its own point?* The thought arrived unbidden, and Lilith recognized it immediately as dangerous—dangerous to the framework she'd been operating from, the framework that said one of them had to win and one had to lose.

*What if the doing is what matters, not the achieving?*

She didn't have an answer. She only had the image of Wei's face—peaceful in a way it hadn't been for two years—and the cold, unsettling recognition that once again, despite everything, she had fed this soul exactly what it needed to grow.

# Scene 6: The Death

July 19, 1864.

The walls fell before dawn.

Lilith felt it as a kind of shudder through the tracking—the moment when inevitability stopped being prophecy and became present tense. Mining tunnels had undermined the northern fortifications. The Qing sappers had done their work well. When the charges detonated, sections of the wall that had stood for eighteen months of siege collapsed inward, and the forces that had been waiting for two years surged through.

Wei was already awake. She had been awake for hours, Lilith thought—though the tracking didn't always make such details clear. Perhaps she'd felt it coming. Perhaps she'd never really slept, these final days.

The aid station was full. Too full. Wounded from the previous day's fighting had arrived faster than they could be treated, and the triage arithmetic had collapsed under the weight of impossible choices. There were perhaps forty patients on pallets. Another twenty on the floor. A handful of workers—nurses, orderlies, the few who hadn't fled—moved among them with expressions that suggested they knew this was the last shift.

When the explosion came, everyone stopped.

Then, slowly, they started again. Because stopping wouldn't change anything.

Wei moved to the entrance of the temple. Lilith followed, adjusting her observation to track both the larger chaos and the particular woman moving through it.

The city was dying in real time. Qing soldiers—regular forces supplemented by the Ever Victorious Army, foreign-led and foreign-armed—poured through the breaches. The defenders who remained fought, but it was the fighting of desperation, not strategy. Everywhere, people ran. Everywhere, smoke rose.

Wei assessed the situation with the calm of someone who had already made peace with what was coming.

"Can we evacuate?" one of the orderlies asked. He was young, barely twenty. His hands were shaking.

Wei looked at the forty patients who couldn't walk. At the twenty who could walk but couldn't fight. At the city that was falling around them.

"No," she said.

But then she did something Lilith didn't expect.

She began organizing an evacuation anyway.

*What are you doing?* Lilith thought—not in frustration, but in genuine curiosity. Watching Wei direct the mobile patients toward a side door, watching her assign orderlies to carry litters, watching her chart a path through the chaos toward a gate she couldn't possibly reach.

She knew it was futile. Lilith could feel her knowing. The Qing forces were everywhere. The evacuation route would be cut off within an hour. Most of these patients would die before nightfall.

She was doing it anyway.

*Purified determination*, Lilith thought. *This is what it looks like.*

She could have intervened. She still had circumstantial access; she could have adjusted the timing of the Qing advance, slowed it, redirected it away from the evacuation route.

But she didn't.

Partly because she suspected it wouldn't work—every intervention had backfired, and intervening to *help* the evacuation might somehow make it worse.

And partly because she wanted to see what happened. What this soul would do at the very end, with no illusions left to sustain it.

Wei got twenty-three patients out of the temple. She organized them into a convoy—litters carried by the ambulatory, the orderlies forming a rough perimeter—and sent them toward the eastern gate.

Then she went back.

"What are you doing?" the young orderly asked.

"There are people who can't be moved," Wei said. "I'm staying with them."

The orderly stared at her. Then, slowly, he nodded. He stayed too.

Lilith watched them return to the temple, to the seventeen patients who remained—too wounded to walk, too wounded to be carried, too wounded for anything except waiting.

The Qing cavalry found the evacuation convoy an hour later. Lilith didn't need to adjust anything; the interception happened on its own, a consequence of the routes available and the forces deployed. All twenty-three patients died. All the orderlies who accompanied them died.

The convoy had been doomed from the moment Wei organized it.

*She knew*, Lilith thought. *She knew, and she did it anyway.*

Because the trying was not nothing.

In the temple, Wei waited.

She treated the wounds of the patients who remained. She talked to those who could still hear, telling them—Lilith couldn't quite parse the words, but the tone was steady, reassuring, the voice of someone who wasn't pretending the end wasn't coming, but also wasn't letting the end define the moment.

The Qing forces arrived at mid-morning.

Wei stood.

She positioned herself between the soldiers and the patients. The young orderly stood beside her. There were no weapons in their hands. There was no way to fight.

Wei's final thought came through the tracking with unexpected clarity—not words, exactly, but meaning. A kind of summary. A closing argument.

*I saved no one. The walls fell. The kingdom fell. Every hand I held went cold.*

A pause.

*But the holding was not nothing. The trying is never nothing.*

And then, with something that felt almost like certainty:

*I will try again.*

The weapon fell.

Lilith felt Wei's death as a kind of hollowing—the soul passing through, the consciousness flickering, the pattern that had been Wei Shufen releasing its current form and flowing onward toward whatever came next.

And she felt something else.

Something she didn't have a name for.

A tightness in her chest that corresponded to nothing in the observation. A weight behind her eyes. A sensation that had no strategic value and shouldn't exist at all.

*Why?* she thought, too surprised to suppress the question. *Why does it hurt to watch her die?*

She'd watched him—her—die eight times now. Death was a waypoint, not an ending. The soul moved on. The pattern continued. There was nothing tragic about transition.

But something in her—something deep, something she didn't want to examine—ached at the moment of Wei's passing.

Not grief, exactly. Something closer to... recognition. As if something in Wei's final thought had touched something in Lilith that she hadn't known was there.

*The trying is never nothing.*

She filed the sensation for later examination. She had work to do.

# Scene 7: The Noir Glimpse

The soul moved.

Lilith followed.

It was easier, this part. Death created the clearest signatures—the moment of release sent ripples through whatever substrate connected incarnations. She rode those ripples like a current, feeling the pattern of the soul as it passed through the between-state and emerged somewhere else.

The intermediate life was brief. A Japanese woman in the 1890s—factory worker, died young of tuberculosis. Lilith noted it without dwelling on it. Not every incarnation was spiritually significant. Some were just... lives. The soul cycling through, resting, gathering what it needed for the next turn of the wheel.

Then the thread brightened.

1920s. America. Los Angeles, or somewhere with that quality of light—Lilith had never visited, but the tracking gave her impressions that suggested it. Sun that felt different from England. Heat that came with a kind of insistence. Architecture that was still inventing itself.

And him.

A man this time. Late twenties when the tracking settled, though she was glimpsing a life that would span decades. Private detective—or something adjacent to that category. The neon and fedora era, the world she'd absorbed from films without ever quite believing it was real.

*The determination has evolved*, she noted with something approaching admiration. *Not conviction anymore. Perseverance.*

She recognized the shift. Wei's purified determination—the trying that needed no outcome—had transformed in its passage through death into something related but distinct. Energy. Perseverance. The capacity to continue despite obstacles.

The detective's life was hard.

Lilith watched it in fragments, letting the tracking compress decades into impressions. Cases that went nowhere. Clients who lied. Victories that turned to ash when the real story emerged. He was good at his job—she could feel that, the careful attention, the refusal to assume—but goodness didn't translate to success.

Every case failed.

That wasn't true, exactly. Some succeeded. But the successes were small, and the failures were large, and the overall arc was one of diminishing returns. By his fifties, he was a marginal figure in a marginal profession, solving problems no one important cared about, making money that barely covered the office rent.

And he continued anyway.

*Perseverance*, Lilith thought. *Purified through failure.*

She didn't intervene.

She could have. The power was there. She could have manifested as a client—the genre practically required it—could have attached to him, could have engineered ever-more-spectacular failures. She could have tested his perseverance the way she'd tested Wei's determination.

But she knew now how that would end.

Eight incarnations. Eight interventions. Eight backfires—the list was complete now, Wei's purified determination the final proof. The pattern was undeniable. Distance didn't prevent it. Method didn't prevent it. The only constant was her opposition—and every opposition accelerated rather than obstructed.

*I would refine him*, she thought. *Every obstacle would become a lesson. Every failure would teach him to fail better. Even here, even in this marginal life, my interference would polish rather than corrupt.*

So she simply watched. The soul she was tracking had some quality—some structural feature she couldn't quite see—that transformed obstruction into fuel.

Or perhaps the quality wasn't in the soul. Perhaps it was in the structure of reality itself. Perhaps there was no way to interfere with genuine spiritual progress that didn't, paradoxically, accelerate it.

This was a troubling thought. She filed it for later.

She watched the detective die. An alley. A case that had finally caught up with him. Quick violence, the kind that films glamorized and reality made ugly.

His final thought had less clarity than Wei's, but the shape was the same:

*Didn't finish the case. But I was on the case. That's something.*

The trying was not nothing.

Lilith felt the familiar ache—the strange recognition she'd felt at Wei's death, returning now, slightly less intense but definitely present. She didn't try to explain it away. Something was happening that she didn't fully understand.

*Why do I hurt when he dies?*

The question sat with her as she followed the thread onward.

Mid-twentieth century. She felt the decades compress—the war, the post-war, the strange acceleration of the 1960s and 1970s. The soul was moving faster now, the lives arriving and departing in quick succession. A soldier. A teacher. A businessman who died of a heart attack at forty-eight.

None of them were spiritually significant. The detective's perseverance had been the last major development—the last transformation this soul would undergo before its current configuration.

And then—

The thread arrived.

Present day.

Lilith felt the moment as a kind of settling—a sense that the tracking had reached its destination. The soul she'd been following for eight years, across dozens of incarnations, through eons of rebirth and development, was *here*.

In her timeline.

In her city, probably. The signature was close. Closer than she'd expected.

Her Manchester body was present to her again—the feeling of sitting, the cool air, the stillness of the flat. She had been away for hours. Perhaps days. Time moved strangely during extended tracking; she'd learned to stop fighting it.

But she couldn't stop now.

She followed the thread to its terminus.

A man. Early thirties. University lecturer—she could feel the institutional affiliation without seeing it directly, the particular texture of an academic life. Philosophy or religious studies, something in that territory. He studied minds, or claimed to study minds. He meditated.

*Oh, he meditates*, Lilith thought, and felt something bloom in her chest—something that was neither purely cold nor purely warm.

She could feel his practice. Not the details—the tracking didn't work that way—but the signature. Regular sitting. Years of it. The kind of slow, steady work that ground down the fetters one by one.

He was close.

Closer than she'd realized.

*First three fetters weakening*, she assessed. *Self-view becoming transparent. Doubt resolving. Attachment to rites and rituals releasing.*

Stream-entry. He was approaching stream-entry.

And she had perhaps two years—maybe three—before he crossed.

The thread stabilized. She had a fix. A location. A target.

Lilith opened her eyes.

*I found him.*

# Scene 8: The Find

Research was comfortable. Research she could do.

Lilith sat at her laptop—the notebooks temporarily set aside, a new mode of investigation replacing the old—and let the internet do what it did best. Academic databases. University directories. Social media traces that people forgot they'd left.

*Silas Pahlavan.*

The name had come to her in the tracking, or after it—she was never quite sure how the transition between observed knowledge and conscious awareness worked. But she knew it now, and the knowledge felt like completion. Like the final piece of a puzzle she'd been assembling for a decade.

Philosophy department. University of Manchester. Lecturer—not full professor, not yet, but the trajectory suggested he would be eventually. Publications on consciousness, phenomenology, the overlap between Eastern contemplative traditions and Western analytical approaches. The kind of work that straddled disciplines, that attracted both interest and suspicion.

She found his faculty profile first. The photograph was small, low-resolution, the kind of perfunctory image that said *this is required* rather than *I care about this*. He was looking slightly away from the camera, his expression somewhere between patience and mild annoyance.

Dark hair. Persian features—the surname made sense now, Iranian heritage probably several generations back. Eyes that were looking at something the photograph couldn't capture.

*A different face*, she noted. *Again.*

The observation caught her off guard. She'd known—had always known, at some level—that the soul she tracked wore different bodies. Different genders, different ethnicities, different ages and configurations. The recognition came through something other than appearance. 

But she hadn't quite registered, until this moment, the contrast with her own constancy.

Her face never changed. Through every past life she'd glimpsed of her own—and there were glimpses, unavoidable side effects of this kind of work—the face was the same. Her widow's peak. Her eyes. The pale crescent that appeared in her left iris when the light hit it correctly.

His face changed every time.

*What does that mean?*

She didn't know. But the question felt important in a way she couldn't quite articulate. Filed for later.

She read his publications. They were good—she could assess that even without deep expertise in the philosophy of mind. Careful, precise, unwilling to claim more than the evidence supported. He wrote about meditation practice from both inside and outside, a practitioner who was also an analyst. The combination was rare.

*How close is he?* She calculated based on what she'd felt in the tracking. *First three fetters weakening. Stream-entry within two or three years, probably sooner.*

The timeline was frighteningly short.

Eight years of tracking. Eight interventions. And now she had perhaps two years—maybe three—before he crossed the threshold she'd been approaching for eons.

If he crossed first...

She didn't complete the thought. The phrase that came to her—*together doesn't hold*—wasn't quite right, but it carried some of the weight. Only one of them could complete. One exit per... something. Per cycle. Per era. If he finished before she did, she would cycle again.

More lives. More bodies. More waiting.

But even as she formed this thought, she felt a strange doubt. The certainty that had sustained her for eight years—that their paths were mutually exclusive, that his progress was her failure—felt less solid than it once had. 

Wei's face floated up: peaceful, released, purified by the very intervention meant to corrupt her.

*What if I'm wrong about something fundamental?*

She shook off the doubt. There wasn't time for philosophical questioning. There was work to do.

She went deeper. Social media presence: minimal. He had accounts but rarely used them. A few posts about departmental events, a handful of liked articles, nothing personal. Divorced, she discovered through detective work that would have made the Noir investigator proud—a passing reference in a colleague's post, a conspicuous absence in group photos after a certain date.

No children. No current partner, as far as she could tell.

He lived alone. He meditated. He taught. He wrote.

He was approaching the threshold.

She closed the laptop and sat for a long moment in her flat, feeling the weight of everything she now knew. Outside the window, Manchester traffic moved in the patterns she'd learned to ignore.

*I found him.*

The statement should have felt triumphant. Eight years of work, finally paying off. A target identified. A strategy possible.

But what she felt, sitting alone with his photograph lingering in her mind, wasn't triumph.

It was something else. Something that made her heart rate elevate slightly—and she was too sophisticated to simply call it adrenaline. Something that made her want to look at his face again, to study the way his eyes weren't quite meeting the camera.

*Interest*, she thought. *Professional interest. He's a worthy... fellow traveler.*

She corrected the word mid-thought. Not opponent. Not target. Fellow traveler.

*He's walking the same path I'm walking. We're both approaching the same threshold.*

*And only one of us can cross.*

---

She found his public lecture series.

It wasn't hard—he was listed on the philosophy department's events page. A series on consciousness studies, open to the public, Tuesday evenings at seven. She could walk there from her flat.

The next lecture was in three days.

*I should observe*, she thought. *I should see him in person. Confirm what the tracking showed.*

The reasoning was perfectly sound. Tracking gave her impressions, not certainties. Seeing him live would provide data she couldn't get any other way.

Three days later, she sat in the back row of a medium-sized lecture hall, anonymous among the mix of students and public attendees. She'd dressed with more thought than she usually gave to clothing. Professional but not formal. Someone who belonged in a university setting but wasn't tied to it.

He was shorter than she'd expected.

That was her first observation—the absurd specificity of a physical body that the tracking never quite conveyed. Five-nine, maybe. Lean in the way that suggested discipline rather than deprivation. Hands that moved precisely when he spoke, each gesture intentional.

He lectured on the relationship between attention and experience. He spoke without slides, without notes, without the performative apparatus that lesser academics used to seem prepared. His voice was calm and precise—the same quality she'd noticed in his writing, translated into sound.

*He's good*, she thought, and was surprised to find she meant it without resentment.

Then he said something about the observer changing the observed, about how attention was never neutral, and she felt a shock of recognition.

*He knows.*

Not everything. Not about her, certainly. But he knew *something*—something about the nature of observation, about the way watching altered what was watched. The same thing she'd learned, in her own way, through eight years of backfires.

*Does he know he's being watched?*

She couldn't tell. His gaze moved across the audience in the practiced sweep of someone who'd been teaching for years—no particular attention to anyone, no moment of eye contact that suggested recognition.

But she felt... seen. Somehow. In a way that had nothing to do with physical sight.

After the lecture, she left before the questions began. She didn't approach him. She didn't introduce herself. She walked back to her flat through the Manchester evening, her mind churning with thoughts she hadn't quite decided how to interpret.

*First sighting*, she would later write in her notebook. *He's exactly as advanced as the tracking suggested. Perhaps more.*

*The strategy must be proximity. Trust. Relationship. I need to be close enough to...*

She paused.

*To what? To stop him? To intervene?*

*Or to understand what I might be missing?*

# Scene 9: The Decision Crystallizes

The notebook lay open in front of her. Not the tracking notebooks—those were history now, their purpose complete. This was a new one, opened specifically for the question that had kept her awake for three nights.

*What now?*

She sat in her tracking corner, but she wasn't tracking. She was thinking. Processing eight years of data, eight outcomes, eight lessons she was only beginning to understand.

She had written lists.

**The Pattern (Evidence)**

*Ch 3-5: Betrayal → Generosity without reciprocity*
*Ch 5-7: Isolation → Concentrated rather than diluted insight*
*Ch 7-9: Circumstance manipulation → Exile as space for transformation*
*Ch 9-11: Feed spiritual pride → Mirror that enabled release*
*Ch 11-13: Stasis field → Impermanence learned through horror*
*Ch 13-15: Cultivate hatred → Suffering as crucible for release*
*Ch 15-17: Feed doubt → Challenges sharpened understanding*
*Ch 17-19: Ensure futility → Determination purified from outcome-attachment*

Eight interventions. Eight accelerations.

She had circled the last line twice.

**The Problem**

Distance didn't work. Every approach from a distance—through vessels, through circumstances, through past lives—had produced the opposite of her intended result. She had tried subtlety and force, patience and pressure, working through intermediaries and working alone. Every method produced the same outcome.

*I have been refining him.*

The sentence sat on the page, stark and unfamiliar. The handwriting was her own, but it read like someone else's diagnosis.

*Every obstacle I place becomes a lesson. Every trap I set becomes a doorway. Opposition is fuel.*

She understood now what she hadn't understood at twenty-five, when she'd first glimpsed a dying man in ancient waters and assumed she could simply redirect his path. The soul she was tracking wasn't just resilient. It wasn't just clever. It had some quality—or perhaps the path itself had some quality—that made obstruction indistinguishable from support.

When she pushed, he grew.

When she obstructed, he strengthened.

When she broke one attachment, the breaking became the lesson that freed him to release others.

*So what*, she wrote slowly, *if I stopped pushing?*

The thought was so foreign that she put down the pen and stared at the wall for several minutes.

She couldn't stop. Could she? There was no stopping. She had spent eons approaching the same threshold he was approaching, and only one of them could cross. *Together doesn't hold.* The ancient memory, the certainty of mutual exclusion.

If he finished before her, she would cycle again. Untold lives. Untold bodies. Waiting.

But even as she recited this to herself, she felt the doubt she'd noticed earlier—the same doubt that had stirred when Wei's face showed release instead of defeat.

*What if I'm wrong about the mutual exclusion? What if 'together doesn't hold' meant something other than what I assumed?*

She didn't know. She only knew that eight years of certainty had produced eight years of backfire.

She picked up the pen.

**The Remaining Options**

Option 1: Continue past-life interventions.
*Result: Predictable. More refinement. More fuel for his progress.*

Option 2: Cease all interventions.
*Result: He continues toward stream-entry on his current trajectory. 2-3 years, maybe less.*

Option 3: Present-day proximity.
*Result: Unknown.*

She underlined the third option.

What if distance was the problem? Not the methods, not the timing, not the execution—the *distance*. Every intervention had come from outside. From another time, another place, another identity. She had never been *present* in the way that mattered.

What if she was present now?

The strategy articulated itself, piece by piece, as she wrote.

*Proximity.* Get close to him. Not as a vessel, not as a circumstantial manipulation, but as herself. As Lilith Azami, the woman she was in this life, the one who could plausibly exist in his professional and personal world.

*Trust.* Establish a relationship. Let him know her—not the full scope of her, but enough that he recognized her as real. Enough that he trusted her presence.

*Relationship.* Deepen the connection. Move from professional to personal. Move from acquaintance to... something else.

Her hand hesitated over the page.

*Intimacy.*

She wrote the word and stared at it.

*If I become essential to his life, I can...*

She paused. What had she been about to write? *Intervene at the critical moment*? *Disrupt his progress*? *Stop him*?

Or something else?

*If I become essential to his life, I can understand something I've been missing. I can see what I've been unable to see from a distance. I can learn what keeps producing backfires.*

This was closer to true. But it wasn't the whole truth.

*If I become essential to his life...*

She didn't complete the sentence. There was something forming beneath the strategy, something she wasn't ready to name.

She would need to change her professional circumstances. The NHS position was already unsustainable; she'd been choosing this work over that work for years, and the NHS work had withered from neglect. But there were opportunities in academic settings—university counseling centers, research positions, clinical faculty appointments. The same kind of institution where he worked.

*Engineering proximity.*

It felt less like strategy than she wanted it to.

**The Professional Pivot**

*Current position: NHS, partial leave, increasingly untenable.*
*Target setting: University. Academic adjacent. His professional world.*
*Mechanism: Clinical faculty appointment? Research collaboration? Student counseling services?*

She would research the options. She would craft applications. She would manufacture the circumstances that would make their meeting seem natural, unplanned, the kind of connection that happened every day between professionals in adjacent fields.

And then she would be close.

Close enough to observe. Close enough to understand. Close enough to...

*Close enough to finally know him*, a part of her whispered. *After eight years of watching him die, to finally see him live.*

She closed the notebook harder than necessary.

*He's the only one who might understand.*

The thought arrived unbidden, and she recognized it immediately as significant. She had been carrying this knowledge—the wheel, the threshold, the exit, the question of how two beings could approach the same destination—for ten years. Alone. No one else could see what she saw. No one else knew what she knew.

But he might.

If she told him. If she explained. If she let him in on the cosmic scope of what they were both approaching...

*No.* She pushed the thought away. *That's not the strategy. The strategy is proximity, observation, understanding. Not confession.*

But the loneliness remained, settling into the silence of her flat like dust.

Eight years of carrying this alone.

And now she was planning to get close to the only other person in the world who might understand it.

*For research purposes*, she told herself.

*For understanding.*

*Not for anything else.*

# Scene 10: Coda — The Approach Begins

Three weeks later.

Lilith sat in the same corner of her flat, but everything had changed.

The tracking notebooks had been organized, dated, filed. They were history now—a record of eight years of observation and intervention. She would refer to them if needed, but their primary purpose was complete. The forward scan was done.

The new notebook—the proximity project—was filling rapidly.

She had submitted applications to four university positions. Two were clinical appointments, the kind of student-support work that she was qualified for but had never particularly wanted. One was a research fellowship—consciousness studies, naturally—that would put her in the same building as the philosophy department. The fourth was more speculative: a guest lectureship on clinical approaches to meditation, proposed to a continuing education program that sometimes cross-listed with Silas's department.

Any of them would work. All of them would give her access.

She had written cover letters in the precise, slightly distanced voice she'd perfected over fifteen years of professional correspondence. She had attached CVs that emphasized her meditation research, her publications on mindfulness-based interventions, her theoretical interest in contemplative traditions. Everything was true. Everything was also strategic.

The NHS position was ending. She'd formally resigned two weeks ago—a relief to everyone, probably, though Dr. Whitmore had managed a convincing impression of regret. Her clinical caseload was being redistributed. Her office would be reassigned. By the end of the month, she would be officially unemployed.

*And free*, she thought, looking at the applications. *Free to do what needs to be done.*

But even that framing—*needs to be done*—felt less certain than it once had. The urgency remained, but it had become complicated by the doubts she'd been accumulating. The backfire pattern. The questions about mutual exclusion. The strange ache she'd felt watching Wei die.

Her mobile rang. She glanced at it—Nadia—and considered not answering. But some habits were difficult to break, and her sister's persistence had only grown since the wedding.

"Hello?"

"You sound distracted." Nadia's voice was warm despite the assessment. "Where are you?"

"Home. Working."

"You're always working." The concern in Nadia's voice was familiar—she'd been expressing it for years, with increasing frequency. "Mum's worried about you. I'm worried about you. Are you still on that... research project?"

*Research project.* Nadia's euphemism for whatever she thought Lilith was actually doing with the notebooks, the absences, the gradual withdrawal from ordinary life.

"The research is complete," Lilith said. "I found what I was looking for."

There was a pause. "That's... good? Is that good?"

"It means I can move to the next phase."

Another pause, longer this time. "Lily." Nadia's nickname for her, rarely used. "I don't understand what you're doing. I've never understood. You used to tell me things—remember? Before all this. We used to talk."

Something stirred in Lilith's chest. Not quite guilt. Something more like recognition—recognition of what she'd let erode in the name of her pursuit.

"I know," she said, and her voice was gentler than she'd intended. "I'm sorry. I wish I could explain."

"Then explain."

The temptation was almost overwhelming. Tell Nadia everything. The tracking. The soul she'd been following through eons. The threshold approaching, the question of whether two beings could complete together. Let someone else carry part of this weight.

But Nadia couldn't understand. Even if she believed—which she wouldn't—she couldn't see what Lilith saw. The knowledge would just become one more thing separating them.

And there was someone who might understand. Someone who could see what she saw, or something close to it.

"I'm changing jobs," Lilith said instead. "Moving to university work. Manchester. I'll be around more."

"That's... good." Nadia didn't sound convinced. "For how long?"

*Until I understand what I've been missing*, Lilith thought. *Until I know whether what I've believed for eons is actually true.*

"For the foreseeable future," she said.

They talked for a few more minutes—Nadia's husband, Nadia's job, the holiday plans Nadia wanted Lilith to attend. Surface conversation, the kind they'd been reduced to. When they hung up, Lilith sat for a long moment with the phone in her hand, feeling the weight of everything she couldn't say.

*He's the only one who might understand.*

The thought came again, and this time she didn't fight it.

Silas Pahlavan. Philosophy lecturer. Consciousness researcher. Meditator approaching the threshold.

If she told him what she knew—what she'd seen, what she'd done, what she understood about the wheel and the threshold and the question that had been driving her for eons—he might actually *get it*. He was the only person on Earth who had a chance of comprehending what she'd been carrying alone for a decade.

*But not yet*, she reminded herself. *First proximity. First understanding. First see what I've been unable to see from a distance.*

She would get close. She would build trust. She would become... what? Important to him. Essential. Real.

And somewhere in that process, she might learn something that changed everything.

The notebooks held ten years of watching him die.

Now she would watch him live.

And find out—finally—whether what she'd believed about their paths was true.

She set down the phone. She opened the laptop. She began drafting a follow-up email for one of the university positions—the research fellowship, the one that would put her closest to his department.

*This is research*, she told herself.

*Proximity for observation. Trust for access. Relationship for understanding.*

But beneath the strategy, something else was forming. Something that had been forming since she'd watched Wei treat a child in a dying kingdom and realized that the trying was never nothing.

Something that felt less like opposition and more like... recognition.

She didn't name it. She wasn't ready.

But it was there.
