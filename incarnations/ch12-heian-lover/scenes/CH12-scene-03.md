The ninth month came, and the leaves did not fall.

Kaoru noticed it first as an absence of color. The maple along the western corridor should have burned crimson by now—every estate in the capital wore autumn like a new robe, the aristocracy timing their poetry gatherings to catch the peak of each tree's transformation. But here, in the garden of the Seiryō Pavilion, the maple remained stubbornly green. Its leaves hung motionless in air that did not move.

He had been coming every night for three weeks. Perhaps four. Time had begun to fold in on itself, the hours between visits contracting while the moments within the estate stretched like silk pulled too thin. His duties at court—the memoranda he should have drafted, the minor ceremonies he should have attended—had become abstractions, obligations that belonged to a version of himself that no longer quite existed.

Tsunefusa had mentioned the Seiryō estate at last week's gathering—in passing, the way courtiers mentioned inconvenient truths. "I visited there once, two seasons ago. The lady's poetry was... adequate. Pleasant, even. But thin." He had hesitated, searching for the word. "Nothing like extraordinary." Kaoru had dismissed the observation then, certain his own aesthetic judgment was superior. Now, remembering the two voices from behind the screen, he wondered if Tsunefusa had been telling him something he was not ready to hear. The extraordinary verse had not come from Lady Hotaru. It had come *through* her, from somewhere else.

Each evening, he brought gifts. Poetry on his finest paper. Incense from the markets near the eastern temple district. A bolt of autumn-colored silk that he had spent three days selecting.

Each evening, the Attendant received them at the gate with a bow so precise it seemed rehearsed beyond any natural movement. She carried them inside without comment. He never saw them again—not displayed, not returned, not acknowledged in any of Hotaru's whispered conversations through the screen. They vanished into the house as completely as sound vanished into its corridors.

Tonight, he had brought a branch of maple. True autumn maple, cut from a tree in the Rokujō gardens, its leaves the exact shade of dried blood. A gift meant to prove something, though he could not have said what.

The Attendant's hands trembled when she took it. Almost imperceptibly—a flutter in her fingers that she corrected immediately—but he saw it. She bowed. The maple branch disappeared with her into the darkness of the service corridor.

Kaoru waited on the veranda. Lady Hotaru's voice drifted from behind the *sudare*, weak tonight, struggling to complete her sentences. The other voice—the clear one, the terrible one—had not appeared in several visits. He found himself waiting for it with something that felt shamefully like anticipation.

"The nights grow cold," Hotaru murmured. "Or perhaps they do not. I cannot always tell. The cold that reaches me seems... old. As though it has been waiting."

"Shall I have more braziers brought?" Kaoru asked.

"No. No, the Attendant manages the warmth. She manages everything. I think sometimes that if she stopped, the house would forget how to exist."

Silence settled between them. No crickets. He had not heard crickets since his first visit. No wind stirred the blinds. The lantern flames burned without flickering, as they always did here, steady as painted fire.

"I brought you autumn," he said. "A branch of maple. Red as—"

"She will take care of it."

The flatness in Hotaru's voice stopped him. He had heard her confused, uncertain, grateful, desperate. He had never heard her sound resigned.

The next evening, Kaoru arrived early. The sun had barely set, the sky still holding the last amber light of day, and he walked the white gravel path with the deliberate pace of a man who has decided to pay attention.

The maple branch was gone. Not set aside, not wilted in some forgotten corner—gone, as though it had never existed. In its place, arranged in simple vases along the corridor, fresh green branches held leaves that should not have appeared for another four months. Spring green. The color of new growth in the second month, when plum blossoms gave way to cherry.

He touched one. The leaf was real—waxy, smooth, alive. Impossible.

A sound from the eastern garden. Kaoru moved toward it without thinking, his feet carrying him off the approved paths and into the overgrown wilderness that surrounded the perfect center. Bamboo closed around him. Ferns brushed his robes. The smell of stagnant water reached him, thick and organic.

There—near the collapsed stone lantern, half-hidden by a screen of wild grasses—the Attendant.

She was bent over a pile of ash. In her hands, the remains of his maple branch smoldered, its red leaves curling into gray nothing. Beside her sat a basket of fresh green cuttings, their stems still weeping sap. She was shaking.

Kaoru stopped. The Attendant had not noticed him—or if she had, she gave no sign. Her shoulders rose and fell with breaths that came too fast, too shallow. Her fingers, black with ash, scraped the remains of the maple into a small hole she had dug in the earth. Erasing it. Burying autumn itself.

The ash pile, the bare earth, the absence—his chest seized without warning. For an instant the garden seemed to flatten into something parched and hostile, a landscape stripped of all moisture and shade. He tasted dust in his mouth, felt sun that was not there burning the back of his neck. Then the sensation passed, and he was standing in the wet overgrowth again, shaking.

He should speak. Announce himself. Demand an explanation for this madness, this deliberate destruction of natural time. Instead, he watched.

The Attendant finished her burial. She gathered the green branches, rose unsteadily to her feet, and turned toward the main house. For one terrible moment, her eyes swept across the place where he stood—and saw nothing. Looked through him as though he were not there, or as though he were simply another element of the garden to be managed, corrected, replaced.

Then she was gone, walking with that mechanical grace back toward the perfect corridors.

Kaoru stood in the wild garden, surrounded by decay he was not supposed to have seen. His chest ached. When he breathed, the air seemed to resist him, thick as water. A cough rose in his throat—not the polite clearing of a nobleman in dusty company, but something deeper, wet, concerning.

He ignored it.

Later, on the veranda, waiting for Hotaru's voice:

"The garden is so beautiful." She sounded dreamy tonight, half-present. "It never changes. I used to love the seasons—the anticipation of what would bloom next, the mourning when it passed. Now I do not have to mourn. Isn't that better? Isn't it better not to lose things?"

"My lady," Kaoru said carefully, "outside these walls, the leaves have turned. Autumn is at its peak."

Silence.

"Is it?" She sounded genuinely uncertain. "I... I cannot remember what autumn looks like. The colors. I know there are colors. But when I try to see them, I see only green. Only spring. Only—"

Her voice broke. Behind the screen, he heard movement—something being set down, hands pressed against fabric, a sound that might have been a sob muffled by silk.

"Forgive me." The voice had changed. Not to the terrible clarity of the puppeteered verses, but to something smaller, rawer. "I think I used to be different. I think there was a woman who lived here before me, and she loved the passing of things. But that woman is gone, and I do not know where she went, and the Attendant says I must not grieve for her because grieving means acknowledging loss and there can be no loss here, there can be no—"

"My lady—"

"Please come again tomorrow." The voice was hollow now, mechanical. The desperate woman had vanished, replaced by something that spoke with her mouth but no longer seemed to live behind her eyes. "I will be here. I am always here. I do not go anywhere. I cannot go anywhere. The garden is beautiful. The garden never changes. Please come again tomorrow."

Kaoru rose. His hands were trembling. His throat burned—from the incense, from the airless rooms, from something deeper that he did not want to name.

He left the Seiryō Pavilion at a near-run, the white gravel scattering beneath his feet. Behind him, the perfect house stood unchanging, its lanterns burning without flicker, its spring blossoms frozen against the autumn night.

He coughed the entire way home. By the time his ox-cart reached the crossing at Fourth Avenue, his sleeve was spotted with something darker than phlegm.

He would return tomorrow. He could not have said why.
