The lamp went out.

Kaoru had been walking the corridor toward the entrance, his mind still caught in the web of Hotaru's voice—the weak one tonight, the one that forgot what it was saying mid-sentence and trailed off into silences that lasted too long. The incense had been particularly heavy, and his chest ached with each breath. He was thinking of nothing except the clean air waiting beyond the gates when the darkness swallowed him.

He stopped. The corridor had no windows; the only light came from oil lamps set in iron brackets along the walls, and the nearest one had simply ceased to burn. No smoke rose from its wick—the flame had not guttered out but vanished, as though it had never existed at all. A cold draft touched his face, carrying the sharp bite of raw lamp oil and something older beneath it, something that smelled of wells and stone.

He should continue to the entrance. The path was simple enough—straight ahead, then right at the garden corner, then through the main gate where his cart waited. He did not need light for that. He had walked it dozens of times.

Instead, he turned toward the service wing.

The Attendant. He wanted to see her before he left. Not for conversation—she rarely spoke more than the necessary courtesies—but to confirm something he could not name. To assure himself that she was still scrubbing, still repairing, still engaged in the endless labor of holding this house together. Her motion was part of the rhythm of this place. Without it, he did not know what the silence would contain.

The service wing branched off to the east, through a low doorway that servants used to move unseen between the kitchens and the main halls. Kaoru ducked his head and entered.

At first he saw nothing. The darkness here was complete, the lamps either unlit or extinguished. Then his eyes adjusted, and he saw her.

The Attendant stood beside a wooden bucket, her hands at her sides. She was not moving. Not breathing, as far as he could tell—her chest neither rose nor fell beneath the plain robes she always wore. The bucket held water; he could see its surface gleaming faintly in what light crept through a high window. But she was not scrubbing. She was not cleaning. She was simply standing, still as furniture, as though someone had placed her there and forgotten to tell her what to do next.

"Attendant?"

His voice came out as barely a whisper. She did not respond.

Kaoru took a step closer. The floorboards creaked beneath him—an actual sound, jarring after the perfect silence of the main halls—and still she did not move. He could see her hands now, hanging loose at her sides. The raw skin at her knuckles had begun to heal, new pink tissue forming over the cracks. She had not been scrubbing. Perhaps for days.

"Are you—"

She looked up.

The woman who met his gaze was not the Attendant. She wore the Attendant's face—the severe widow's peak, the single dark strand falling across the left brow—but the expression behind those features had changed completely. The frantic energy was gone. The mechanical devotion was gone. In its place was something Kaoru had never encountered in any court, any temple, any gathering of the learned men who prided themselves on wisdom: a perfect, clinical stillness.

Her left eye caught what little light filtered through the window, and he saw it clearly for the first time—a crescent of pale green at the upper edge of the iris, vivid as new growth against the deep brown beneath it. The mark should have been beautiful. Instead, it made his stomach turn, as though some fundamental law of how faces should look had been violated.

She tilted her head. The motion was slow, deliberate, and utterly wrong—not the tilt of curiosity but the tilt of assessment, the way a hawk might regard a mouse before deciding whether it was worth the effort to kill.

"You should not be here." Her voice was different. Lower. Smoother. Without the sing-song quality that colored her courtesies. "This is not part of the arrangement."

Kaoru could not move. His feet had rooted themselves to the floorboards. His hands hung at his sides, useless, trembling. Something in his chest had seized—not the cough, not the illness that had been building for weeks, but something older, something his blood remembered even if his mind could not name it.

"Who—"

She blinked.

The change was immediate. The clinical stillness shattered. The woman who remained looked around wildly, her breath coming in sudden gasps, her hands flying to her face as though checking that it was still there. Her eyes—the strange green crescent now invisible in the dim light—swept across the room, across Kaoru, across herself, and found no answers to questions she could not articulate.

"I—" Her voice was the Attendant's again, high and fraying at the edges. "I do not—how did I—"

She ran. There was no other word for it. She gathered her robes and fled through the service corridor, her footsteps receding into the darkness until the house swallowed them entirely and left Kaoru standing alone beside the bucket of still water.

His reflection looked up at him from the surface. A man he barely recognized—pale, hollowed, the robes hanging loose on a frame that had lost weight it could not afford to lose. His hands trembled. His chest ached. His throat burned with incense and something else, something that tasted like iron.

He made his way to the entrance on legs that did not feel like his own. The white gravel path stretched before him, perfect as ever, the lanterns burning with their uncanny steadiness. The spring blossoms hung motionless against the autumn sky.

He understood, now. The house was not merely haunted. Something lived inside the Attendant—something that watched, that waited, that assessed visitors with eyes that did not belong in a human face. And that something knew he had seen it.

He should not return. The thought was clear as temple water, sharp as an unsheathed blade. He should burn his robes, bathe for three days, have priests examine him for any taint that might have followed him home. He should never speak the name of this place again.

But Hotaru's voice echoed in his memory, thin and lost and desperate. *I have been alone for so very long.*

He climbed into his ox-cart. The driver did not ask questions. By the time they reached Fourth Avenue, Kaoru had decided nothing and everything.

He would return tomorrow.
