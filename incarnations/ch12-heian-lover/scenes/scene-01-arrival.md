# Scene I: The Arrival

---

The scent of pine smoke and stale perfume hung beneath the eaves of the Kujō mansion, heavy as the brocade curtains drawn against the autumn chill. In the northern gallery, a dozen courtiers recited verses about chrysanthemums, each poem more exquisite than the last, each voice pitched to suggest depths of feeling that Fujiwara no Kaoru could not, despite his reputation, bring himself to counterfeit.

He sat apart from the circle, his robes—autumn colors, browns bleeding into faded gold—arranged with deliberate carelessness over the cypress boards. A sake cup warmed his palm. His thumb traced its rim, again and again, a habit he could not remember acquiring.

"*The morning dew*," one of the younger lords recited, "*lingers on the petal's edge—*"

Kaoru stopped listening. The dew did not linger. The dew evaporated. The petal would fall. These men knew this, celebrated it in their verses, and yet they spoke of impermanence as though it were ornament, a pleasing melancholy to be worn like a new hunting robe and set aside when the season turned.

He raised the cup to his lips. The sake was cold.

A servant shuffled forward on his knees, bent nearly double, and placed a folded paper beside Kaoru's elbow. The bark grain was unfamiliar—not the smooth *torinoko* favored at court, but something rougher, fibrous, smelling faintly of sand and a heat that did not belong to this late-autumn evening.

Kaoru set down his cup. His thumb continued its circuit along the ceramic edge for three rotations before he realized he was doing it, and stopped.

The poem inside was written in a woman's hand, though not in the florid style that court ladies practiced until their characters became indistinguishable from one another. This brush moved like water over stone—effortless, inevitable, leaving a clarity that court calligraphy spent years learning to avoid.

*In my garden blooms*  
*a moon that never sets—come,*  
*and I will show you*  
*how beauty outlasts the frost,*  
*outlasts even the watcher.*

His chest tightened. Not at the poem's elegance—though it was elegant—but at its promise. *A moon that never sets.* The words answered something in him that he had not known was asking.

"My lord?" The servant waited, forehead still pressed to the floor. "The messenger said the lady hopes for a reply."

"Who sent this?"

"A retainer from the Seiryō Pavilion, my lord. West of—"

"I know where it is."

Everyone knew where it was. The Seiryō Pavilion had housed minor Fujiwara branches for three generations, each less fortunate than the last. The current owner—if owner was the word for someone who could not afford servants to maintain the gates—was said to be a recluse. Some illness. Some scandal, half-remembered. The sort of person one no longer saw at court functions because one no longer remembered to look.

Kaoru folded the poem again, aligned its edges precisely, and slipped it into his sleeve.

"No reply."

He would go tonight.

The ox-cart jolted over a root that had buckled the avenue's paving stones. Kaoru gripped the lacquered frame as the driver called encouragement to the beast, his voice swallowed by darkness filling the gaps between estate walls. Oil lamps had been lit along the main thoroughfare, but here—two streets from the Imperial Palace, yet a world removed from its ceremonial brightness—the great houses stood shuttered and silent.

Rain had fallen earlier. The cart wheels splashed through shallow pools that reflected nothing; no moon, no stars, only the swaying light of his own lantern casting shadows that seemed to move independent of their source.

The air changed first. He noticed it before the cart slowed—a thickness, a stillness, as though they had passed through some membrane separating one season from another. The scent of chrysanthemums should have been everywhere at this time of year, that crisp vegetable bitterness of autumn. Instead, he smelled plum blossoms.

Plum blossoms, which had no business blooming for another four months.

The Seiryō Pavilion's outer walls rose on his left, and Kaoru understood why the place had earned its reputation. Collapse would have been less unsettling than what he saw. The wall had not crumbled—it had rotted, slowly, the plaster sloughing away to reveal wooden bones black with moisture. Moss climbed the exposed beams. A gate hung from a single hinge, caught mid-fall for what might have been years. Beyond it, darkness pooled like ink in a shallow dish.

But the path.

The path leading from the ruined gate to the main hall shone white in the lantern light. White gravel, raked in patterns so precise that each line seemed to glow against the surrounding decay. Not a single leaf marred its surface. Not a single weed had cracked its border.

Kaoru stepped down from the cart. His sandals sank into mud, then found the gravel, and made a sound like teeth grinding.

The driver was already turning the ox. "My lord, I will wait at the crossing of Fourth and—"

"Wait here."

"My lord, this place—"

"Wait."

He walked the white path. On either side, the garden had surrendered to wilderness decades ago—bamboo grown into choking thickets, stone lanterns toppled and swallowed by ferns, a pond visible only as a gleam of stagnant water between overgrown reeds. But the path remained immaculate. Someone had swept it within the hour. Perhaps within the minute.

The Seiryō Pavilion's main hall rose before him, three stories in the old style, its cypress beams polished to a sheen that reflected his lantern back at him like dark water. Screens and blinds hung in perfect alignment. Incense smoke drifted from somewhere inside—plum, again, impossibly, the scent of spring in the throat of autumn.

Movement.

He stopped. His hand found the edge of his folded fan and gripped it, though what he intended to do with a paper fan against whatever moved in that darkness, he could not have said.

A woman knelt on the eastern veranda. She scrubbed small circles against the cypress boards with a cloth that had once been white and was now stained the rust-red of old blood. Her movements were mechanical, relentless—not the careful work of a servant maintaining a household, but something closer to compulsion. Her fingers, visible now as his eyes adjusted, were raw. The skin at her knuckles had cracked and wept. She did not pause. She did not look up.

"I received a poem." His voice came out rougher than he intended. "From this household."

The woman stopped.

For a long moment she remained motionless, her cloth frozen mid-stroke, her body arranged in a stillness so complete that she seemed to have become part of the architecture. Then she raised her head.

Dark hair drawn back severely from her face, a single thick strand escaped and falling across her left brow. Widow's peak. Eyes that were difficult to read in the dim light—one seemed darker than the other, or perhaps it was a trick of the lantern, a pale crescent visible at the upper edge where no iris should have shown such color.

She smiled. The expression did not reach those strange eyes.

"The Lady has been expecting you." Her voice was steady, almost musical, at odds with her bleeding hands. "Please. Follow."

She rose in a single fluid motion and moved toward the main entrance without checking whether he followed. The cloth hung forgotten in her grip, leaving small rust-colored drops on the white path.

Kaoru should have left. The ruined estate, the impossible plum scent, the woman scrubbing her own flesh raw against floorboards that did not need cleaning—these were warnings his body understood even if his mind had not yet assembled them into a coherent fear. His feet remained rooted to the gravel, and for one breath, perhaps two, he stood at the edge of a choice he did not fully perceive.

The Lady's poem rustled against his chest. *A moon that never sets.*

He followed the bloodstained path into the perfect house.
