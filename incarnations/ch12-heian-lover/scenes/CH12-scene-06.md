The storm passed sometime in the hours before dawn. Kaoru did not notice. He had stopped noticing things that did not involve the weight in his arms, the cold that had seeped through his robes and into his bones, the shallow rhythm of his own breathing—each inhale a negotiation with lungs that no longer wanted to cooperate.

Lady Hotaru had grown cold long ago. He knew this the way he knew the color of the sky or the sound of his own name—as a fact that existed independent of his feelings about it. Her body had stiffened, then relaxed again, settling into a stillness that no living person could have held. He had not set her down. He did not intend to.

Grey light crept through the shattered ceiling. Dawn, or something close to it—the sky still heavy with the storm's residue, clouds the color of old silk stretched thin across the horizon. Rain no longer fell, but moisture hung in the air, beading on every surface, turning the ruins of the Seiryō Pavilion into something that glistened like the inside of a shell.

The white gravel path was gone, buried under mud and debris. The perfect gardens had surrendered to chaos—branches scattered like bones, the pond overflowed and mingling with the grounds, the stone lanterns toppled and half-submerged in brown water. Somewhere in the wreckage, the fragments of screens and blinds lay tangled with the remains of silk robes and lacquered boxes that had spilled from storage rooms no one had opened in decades.

And the blossoms. The impossible spring blossoms that the Attendant had maintained through sheer force of will—they lay everywhere, stripped from branches that had finally been permitted to age. Plum petals mixed with mud, their white fading to grey, their edges curling as they began the decay that had been denied them for so long.

Kaoru looked at it all. The ugliness. The truth.

He found it beautiful.

Not in the way he had understood beauty before—not the curated perfection of court gardens, not the arranged elegance of a well-composed poem, not the artificial grace of a woman's voice speaking through a screen. This was a different kind of beauty, raw and terrible and honest. The beauty of things as they actually were, stripped of the constructions that made them bearable.

*It is beautiful because it is dying,* he thought again. The words had settled into him now, taking root. *It was always beautiful because it was dying. The dying was the beauty. I could not see it until now.*

His chest ached. Not metaphorically—a literal, physical pain that radiated from somewhere deep in his lungs, spreading with each shallow breath. The cough that had been building for weeks had become something more. He could taste blood in the back of his throat, could feel the fever burning behind his eyes. The weeks of breathing incense in airless rooms, of walking through gardens saturated with unnatural preservation, of refusing to listen to what his body had been trying to tell him—it had all caught up at once.

He was dying. He knew this the same way he knew the sky and his name. Another fact, independent of feeling.

He did not mind.

The Attendant was gone. He had not seen her since the height of the storm, when she had screamed at him not to look. Perhaps she had fled when her work was destroyed. Perhaps she had simply ceased to exist, her purpose ended. Perhaps she was out there somewhere, wandering the ruined streets of the capital, trying to understand what she had been and what she had lost.

Kaoru did not wonder about her for long. What lived behind her eyes—the clinical watcher, the thing that assessed him like a hawk studying prey—that was a mystery he would not solve in whatever time remained to him. And somehow, it did not seem to matter. The mystery was not the point. The mystery had never been the point.

The point was this: a woman dying in his arms, and his choice to stay.

He had spent his life chasing beauty. Pursuing it across gardens and galleries, through poems and performances, in the faces of women who smiled at him from behind fans. He had believed that beauty existed outside of himself—a treasure to be captured, possessed, preserved against the indignity of decay. He had been wrong.

Beauty was not something you captured. Beauty was something you witnessed. It appeared in the moment of passing, in the space between what was and what would be. It required impermanence the way fire required air. Without the dying, there was nothing to see.

The Attendant had tried to freeze time. She had tried to give him a world without decay, a love without loss, a beauty that never faded. And in doing so, she had created something monstrous—a prison of perfection, a trap built from the very things he thought he wanted.

He understood now why it had felt wrong from the beginning. Why his body had rebelled, why his dreams had turned to nightmares, why every evening in that perfect house had left him more hollowed than the one before. He had been suffocating in the absence of death.

*I will not make this mistake again,* he thought. Then: *Will there be an again?*

The question drifted through his fever-clouded mind. He did not know where it had come from or what it meant. But something in him—something older than memory, something that lived in the spaces between breaths—answered without words.

*Yes. There will be an again. And you will carry this with you.*

The sun rose, eventually. Weak and watery, filtering through clouds that would not fully clear for days. It found Kaoru still sitting in the mud, still cradling the woman who had died in his arms, still breathing—though barely, now, each inhale a shallow gasp that did not quite fill his lungs.

Servants would come soon, perhaps. People from the city, surveying the storm damage, looking for survivors. They would find a young courtier in ruined robes, holding the body of an old woman no one remembered. They would not understand what they were seeing. They would not need to.

Kaoru's eyes drifted closed. The world faded—not to darkness, but to grey, the color of honest light, the color of things as they actually were.

His final thought was not of beauty. Not of poetry. Not of the woman in his arms or the ghost who had tried to trap him.

It was simpler than that. A single, quiet recognition:

*To endure what is real. That is enough. That is everything.*

The fever claimed him gently, like water closing over his head. He did not struggle. He did not cling to the breath that was leaving him. He simply let go—and in the letting go, something settled.

A lesson, planted deep. A seed that would grow in soil he could not yet imagine.

Patience. The strength to endure reality without fleeing into illusion.

Somewhere far away, in a time that had not yet happened, a man would be accused of heresy and tortured for his beliefs. He would endure. He would not break.

And he would not know why he was so certain that truth was worth more than comfort.

But he would be certain.

And that certainty would begin here, in the mud, in the morning, in the arms of a man who had finally learned what beauty required.
