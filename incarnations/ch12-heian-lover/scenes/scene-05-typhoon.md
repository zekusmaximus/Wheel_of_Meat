The storm came from the south, moving faster than the messengers who tried to warn the capital. By the time Kaoru heard the first crash of thunder from his chambers in the Rokujō district, the sky had already turned the color of a bruise—purple-black, swollen with a violence that the city's elegant architecture had never been built to withstand.

He should stay inside. The prudent move, the courtier's move, the move that any reasonable man would make when wind began to tear tiles from rooftops. His servants had already secured the shutters. His ox had been led to the covered stables. There was nothing required of him except to wait.

But the Seiryō Pavilion rose in his mind—its perfect corridors, its impossible gardens, its lanterns that burned without flicker. And Hotaru, always behind her screen, whispering fragments of sentences that never quite completed themselves.

*I have been alone for so very long.*

He was running before he realized he had decided to move.

The streets had emptied. What remained was chaos—loose debris rolling across the paving stones, shutters torn from their hinges and spinning through the air, the distant screams of those who had not found shelter in time. Rain fell in sheets so thick that Kaoru could barely see ten paces ahead. His robes, soaked through within moments, clung to a body that had grown thin during his weeks of visiting, and each breath came harder than the last.

No ox-cart would run tonight. He went on foot, keeping to the center of the avenues where the wind had less purchase, ducking into covered walkways when the gusts threatened to throw him off his feet. Lightning split the sky in great jagged cracks, and in its light, the city became unrecognizable—all the beauty stripped away, the bones of its architecture exposed and fragile.

The Seiryō Pavilion's gates stood open. Undamaged, simply open, as though someone had forgotten to close them. Kaoru passed through without slowing and found himself on the white gravel path.

It was no longer white. Mud had washed across it in brown waves, obscuring the careful patterns, drowning the perfection in ordinary filth. Branches littered the ground—not the pristine green cuttings he had grown accustomed to, but real autumn debris, leaves the color of rust and fire, torn from trees that had finally been permitted to die.

The main hall loomed ahead, its screens rattling in their frames. Several had already blown in, their paper torn to ribbons that whipped in the wind like the tongues of ghosts.

And there—in the garden—the Attendant.

She was running back and forth along the eastern veranda, her robes drenched, her hair escaped from its bindings and streaming behind her like a dark flag. In her hands she held a wooden shutter, and she was trying—desperately, futilely—to force it back into its frame. The wind tore it from her grip. She caught it. The wind tore it again.

"Stop!" she screamed at the storm itself. "This is not— you cannot— the arrangement—"

Her voice cracked on the last word. She dropped the shutter and grabbed the frame of the veranda with both hands, as though she could hold the house together through will alone. Her fingers, healed from their earlier rawness, now bled fresh where the splintering wood cut into them.

Kaoru climbed onto the veranda. "We have to get inside!"

She turned. Her face was wild—the clinical stillness he had seen in the service wing was gone, replaced by something shattered. The manic servant had collided with whatever watched behind her eyes, and the result was chaos.

"You should not be here!" The voice flickered between registers, high and low, desperate and cold. "This was— I was unfinished— there was more time—"

A crack like the world splitting open. The great maple at the garden's edge—the one she had been protecting all these weeks, replacing its leaves with impossible green—toppled. Its trunk, rotted through in ways that no amount of careful maintenance could have hidden, gave way at the base. It fell slowly, almost gracefully, and crashed through the eastern veranda with a sound that Kaoru would hear in his dreams for whatever remained of his life.

The Attendant screamed. Beyond words, beyond language—a sound of grief so profound that it seemed to tear itself from her throat against her will. She fell to her knees in the wreckage, her hands scrabbling at the broken wood as though she could somehow put it back.

Kaoru stepped around her. The shattered veranda led to the eastern gallery—Hotaru's gallery, where he had sat so many nights listening to her fractured voice. The *sudare* that had hidden her was gone, ripped away by the wind and wrapped around a fallen beam.

And there, in the grey storm-light, was Lady Hotaru.

She was old. That was the first thing he understood—old in the way that suggested not years but erosion, as though time had worn her down to something barely substantial. Her hair, which he had imagined dark and lustrous, was white and thin, escaping in wisps from a loose braid. Her skin hung loose on bones that seemed too fragile to support even such meager flesh. She huddled in robes that had once been fine but now showed their age in frayed hems and faded colors, the brocade patterns almost invisible beneath years of wear.

She was sick. That was the second thing. The smell hit him even through the rain—old medicine, herbal poultices, the sweet-rot stench of flesh that had begun to fail. Her breathing came in shallow gasps. Her eyes, when she looked up at him, were clouded with cataracts.

She was terrified. That was the third thing, and somehow the worst. She pressed herself against the wall behind her, arms raised as though to ward off a blow, her mouth working around words that would not come. She did not know who he was. She did not know where she was. She knew only that the beautiful lie that had surrounded her had been torn away, and now she was exposed—dying, decaying, *real*—in front of a stranger's eyes.

"Please—" Her voice was nothing like the one he had heard through the screen. Cracked, ruined, barely audible. "Please, I never asked— she told me it would be beautiful— she said the poet would love me if I stayed still and let her speak—"

"Do not look!"

The Attendant's voice, behind him. He turned. She stood in the wreckage of the veranda, rain streaming down her face, her eyes flickering between manic and clinical in a way that seemed physically painful to witness.

"Do not look at her! The beauty is still here— I can rebuild it— if you would only stop looking—"

A breaking in Kaoru's chest.

Deeper than the illness that had been building for weeks—older, what had calcified around his heart without his knowing. The need for perfect beauty. The hunger for things that did not decay. The compulsion to rescue the ideal from the ordinary wreckage of the world.

He looked at Lady Hotaru—old, sick, terrified, real—and he did not feel revulsion. He felt something that lived on the other side of all his aesthetic obsessions, in a country he had not known existed.

He knelt beside her. The rain poured through the ruined roof, soaking them both. The wind howled. Somewhere behind him, the Attendant was screaming words that no longer mattered.

"I am here," he said. His voice, rough with illness, with incense, with weeks of breathing poison air, came out gentler than he had expected. "I am not leaving."

Lady Hotaru looked at him. Her clouded eyes searched his face for something—deception, perhaps, or the disgust she clearly expected. She found neither.

"I am dying," she whispered.

"Yes." He took her hand. The skin was papery, cold, stretched over bones like bird wings. "I know."

"She—the servant—she said she could make me beautiful again. She said a poet would come, and he would see me as I was, and I would not be alone anymore." Tears cut tracks through the dirt on her face. "But it was never me he saw. It was only what she made."

"I see you now," Kaoru said.

The storm raged. The perfect house collapsed around them in stages, each crash bringing down another section of the impossible preservation. The Attendant's screams had faded—whether she had fled or simply stopped, he could not tell. What mattered was here: an old woman dying, a young man who had learned too late what beauty actually required.

"It's cold," Hotaru murmured.

Kaoru gathered her into his arms. She weighed almost nothing. The shattered ceiling let the rain pour down on them both, washing away the last of the incense, the last of the preservation, the last of everything that had been constructed to hide the truth.

*It is beautiful because it is dying,* he thought. The words rose in him like a verse taking shape. *It was always beautiful because it was dying. I could not see it until now.*

He did not know how long he held her. Minutes. Hours. The storm began to fade, its violence exhausted. Grey light crept through the clouds—not dawn, not yet, but the promise of it.

Lady Hotaru's breathing slowed. Then stopped.

Kaoru remained where he was, cradling her body, surrounded by the ruins of the perfect house. He was shaking. From what felt like the loosening of chains he had not known he wore, colder than any storm.

The Attendant was gone. Where she had fled, he could not guess. Perhaps back into the vessel's original life. Perhaps somewhere else entirely, somewhere beyond the edges of the world.

It did not matter. What mattered was the woman in his arms, and the truth he had finally permitted himself to see.
