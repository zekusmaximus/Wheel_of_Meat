The Attendant led him through corridors that smelled of dust and plum, always plum, until the fragrance thickened into something almost physical. By the time she slid open the panel to the eastern gallery, Kaoru's throat burned with it.

"Please wait here." She bowed, the movement fluid despite the rawness of her hands. "The Lady will speak with you presently."

She withdrew. The panel closed. Kaoru stood alone in a room that should not have existed.

The eastern gallery opened onto a small interior garden, visible through latticed screens that filtered what little moonlight penetrated the overcast sky. Lanterns burned at precise intervals along the veranda—not the sputtering oil lamps of most estates, but something steadier, their flames unnaturally still despite the draft that crept beneath the screens. The tatami beneath his knees was fresh, the woven edge crisp as newly cut grass. Every surface gleamed.

He had seen grand houses before. This was different. Grand houses showed their age in honorable ways—a patina of use, the comfortable wear of generations. This room felt preserved, as though someone had stopped time at the moment of its completion and held it there by force of will.

Behind the *sudare* at the far end of the gallery, a shape moved. Fabric rustling against fabric. The creak of a low table being adjusted.

"You came." The voice that emerged was barely a voice at all—thin, reedy, punctuated by the labored breath of someone for whom speech required effort. "I did not... I was not certain you would."

Kaoru bowed toward the blind, though she could not see him any better than he could see her. "Your poem moved me, my lady. I could not stay away."

A pause. The sound of breathing, rough at the edges.

"The poem," she said. Her voice wavered on the last syllable, as if she were trying to remember something that kept slipping away. "Yes. I... wrote it. I think I wrote it."

The uncertainty should have troubled him. Instead, he found it charming—the humility of a true artist, unable to take credit for what the gods had channeled through her brush. He had met poets who remembered every verse they'd ever composed and recited them at every gathering. This was different. This was genuine.

"Will you honor me with another?" He kept his voice soft, the register he used with nervous horses and grieving widows. "Your words are unlike anything I have encountered at court."

Silence stretched between them. Behind the *sudare*, the shape shifted, and for a moment he thought she would refuse.

Then the voice changed.

"*The watcher at the gate—*"

It was not the same voice. The thin uncertainty had vanished, replaced by something deeper, richer, a timbre that seemed to bypass his ears entirely and settle in the base of his spine. The words came with the inevitability of water finding its level.

"*—does not know the hour.*  
*He counts the falling leaves,*  
*but leaves do not count him.*  
*When the moon outlasts the watcher—*  
*what then?*"

The final syllable hung in the incense-thickened air. Kaoru realized he had stopped breathing. His hands, folded in his lap, had clenched without his permission.

The poetry of the court celebrated beauty. It mourned impermanence. It played elegant games with seasonal imagery and layered allusion. What he had just heard did none of those things. It asked a question that he could not answer—and worse, a question he was not certain he wanted answered.

"My lady," he managed. His voice came out rougher than he intended. "That was—"

"Did I say something beautiful?"

The voice had changed again. Thin. Uncertain. Confused.

"I so rarely..." She trailed off. Behind the blind, the shape seemed smaller suddenly, contracted, as though whatever had filled it a moment ago had withdrawn. "Forgive me. I cannot always remember. The words come, and then they go, and I am... I am not certain which ones I spoke and which ones I only thought."

Something cold moved through Kaoru's chest. Not fear—he did not name it fear—but something adjacent to it, a wrongness that his body registered before his mind could articulate. The woman behind that screen had spoken in two voices. One weak and dying. One clear as a temple bell.

The incense swelled around him, cloying, sweet to the point of rot. Beneath it—beneath the plum, beneath the smoke—something else lurked. Something the perfumed air was working very hard to hide.

He should leave. The thought surfaced clearly, a single bright warning in the fog of his fascination. This house was cursed, or haunted, or something else entirely that priests should examine and nobles should avoid. The woman behind the screen was ill—ill in body, perhaps ill in mind—and he had no business sitting here, breathing this poison air, listening to a voice that was not one voice but two.

He did not leave.

"My lady," he said instead, "may I return tomorrow?"

The pause that followed lasted long enough that he thought she had not heard him, or had heard and would not answer. Then the blind moved—not lifted, but pressed outward from within, as though a hand had rested against it from the other side.

"Yes." The voice was weak again, grateful, almost desperate. "Yes. Please. I have been alone for so very long. The days... the days do not pass here as they should. I think it has been spring for months. Or perhaps years. I cannot—"

She broke off. A dry sound that might have been a cough or might have been a sob.

"I will return," Kaoru said. He rose to his knees, bowed again toward the screen, and began to make his way back through the corridor. The plum scent followed him like a living thing, clinging to his robes, filling his lungs.

At the entrance, the Attendant waited. She did not look at him as she slid the screen aside to let him pass. Her face was composed, blank, the strange pale crescent in her eye invisible in the dim light.

"Thank you," he said, uncertain why he was thanking her.

"The Lady values your company." Her voice carried no inflection. "Your visits bring her... stability."

The word was wrong. He knew it was wrong even as she spoke it. Stability implied something out of balance, something that needed correction. But the Attendant's face revealed nothing, and Kaoru was already stepping out onto the white gravel path, already drawing the night air into lungs that ached for something clean.

Behind him, the perfect house stood silent. The lanterns burned without flickering. The plum trees held their impossible blossoms against the autumn sky.

He would return tomorrow. He could not have said why.
