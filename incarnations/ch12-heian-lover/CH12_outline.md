## Thematic Core & Genre Translation
* **The Gothic Engine:** "Love amidst Terror." The obstacle is not social rank, but the mortal danger emanating from the beloved.
* **The "Great House":** A dilapidated estate on the fringes of the capital (Toribeno), overgrown with autumn weeds. It is beautiful, isolating, and actively hostile.
* **The "Bluebeard" Dynamic:** Kaoru enters Lilith’s domain (the Ruined Pavilion). He is the "Damsel" probing a secret that will consume him; she is the mysterious, threatening presence.
* **The Lesson:** Equanimity (upekkhā). By confronting the "perfect" object of desire and finding it hollow/terrifying, he learns that craving cannot be satisfied by form.

## Scene Breakdown

### PART I: THE DESCENT (Scenes 1-2)

**Scene 1: The Summons (The Hollow Court)**
* **Gothic Beat:** The heroine leaves civilization.
* **Action:** The Imperial Court is suffocatingly safe. Kaoru feels the "ennui" of perfection. He receives a mysterious poem attached to a branch of fading autumn leaves. It hints at a beauty that exists only in decay.
* **The Hook:** It summons him to an old estate near the cremation grounds (Toribeno).
* **Voice Note:** Sensory anchor on the cloying perfume of the court vs. the sharp scent of the dead leaves.

**Scene 2: The Crossing (Into Isolation)**
* **Gothic Beat:** The physical journey into danger. Weather turns.
* **Action:** Kaoru travels by oxcart to the fringes of the capital. The fog rolls in. The refined city gives way to wild grasses and rotting wooden gates.
* **The Setting:** The Ruined Estate. It has a "personality"—melancholy, hungry. The servants are terrified and refuse to go past the gate.
* **Lilith’s Intervention (Indirect):** She controls the atmosphere. The fog separates him from his retinue. He is physically isolated.

### PART II: THE HAUNTING (Scenes 3-6)

**Scene 3: The Meeting (The Uncanny)**
* **Gothic Beat:** First encounter. Mysterious, rude, or distant.
* **Action:** Kaoru enters the main pavilion. It is ruined but elegantly furnished with ancient screens. He sees *Her* (Lady Hotaru) behind a misu (bamboo blind).
* **The Interaction:** She does not invite him in. She speaks in riddles about the "vanishing of things." The widow's peak and strange eye are glimpsed through the slats.
* **The Feeling:** She is terrifyingly attractive. He feels a "mortal danger" but mistakes it for the thrill of love (The Sublime).

**Scene 4: The Intrusion (The Gaslight)**
* **Gothic Beat:** Strange events. Footsteps. Is she real?
* **Action:** Kaoru returns to the capital but is haunted. He receives letters that know his private thoughts. He sees her face in the moon, in the water.
* **The Rival:** A friend (Prince Atsumichi) claims to have visited the same estate but found only a fox-hole. Kaoru questions his sanity. Is he being gaslit by a spirit?
* **Lilith’s Intervention (Social):** She manipulates the rival to visit the estate, where he is frightened into illness (or madness), proving the danger is real.

**Scene 5: The Thaw (The Seduction)**
* **Gothic Beat:** Vulnerability. The romance blooms.
* **Action:** Kaoru returns to the estate. Lady Hotaru allows him closer. She shares a "secret"—a tragic past (fabricated) that mirrors his own longing.
* **The Trap:** She touches his hand. The sensation is electric but draining (like touching ice). He pledges his life to her. He agrees to stay forever.

**Scene 6: The Black Moment (The Discovery)**
* **Gothic Beat:** Finding proof of the Secret.
* **Action:** Kaoru explores the estate while she sleeps (or seems to). He finds the "locked room" or its equivalent—perhaps a collection of poems from men who died of longing. Or he sees her reflection in a mirror, and it is *wrong* (shifting, ancient, or monstrous).
* **The Realization:** She is not a tragic noblewoman. She is something that *eats* longing.

### PART III: THE PURGE (Scenes 7-8)

**Scene 7: The Cataclysm (The Storm)**
* **Gothic Beat:** Fire or Storm. The confrontation.
* **Action:** A typhoon hits. The estate groans like a dying beast.
* **The Manifestation:** Lilith drops the mask. She manifests fully—beautiful, terrifying, undeniable. She demands he merge with her (the ultimate possession). "Be mine, and you will never fade."
* **The Rejection:** Kaoru, terrified and awed, sees the *mechanism* of his desire. He realizes the "Hotaru" he loves is a projection of his own mind. He refuses to grasp.
* **The Climax:** The rejection shocks her. The manifestation destabilizes. The pavilion collapses (or burns, if lightning strikes). Kaoru flees into the storm, coughing blood.

**Scene 8: The Scars (Death & Insight)**
* **Gothic Beat:** The somber ending.
* **Setting:** Weeks later. Kaoru’s winter residence.
* **Action:** He is dying of the "wasting sickness" contracted at the estate (karmic exhaustion).
* **The Insight:** He holds a fan given to him by Hotaru. It crumbles to dust. He realizes: *Beauty cannot be possessed. Truth is inward.*
* **Death:** He dies with the "Scars" of the encounter, but his spirit is free of the craving that drew him there. He has learned Equanimity.
