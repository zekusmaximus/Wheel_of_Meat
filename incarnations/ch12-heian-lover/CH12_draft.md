The scent of pine smoke and stale perfume hung beneath the eaves of the Kujō mansion, heavy as the brocade curtains drawn against the autumn chill. In the northern gallery, a dozen courtiers recited verses about chrysanthemums, each poem more exquisite than the last, each voice pitched to suggest depths of feeling that Fujiwara no Kaoru could not, despite his reputation, bring himself to counterfeit.

He sat apart from the circle, his robes—autumn colors, browns bleeding into faded gold—arranged with deliberate carelessness over the cypress boards. A sake cup warmed his palm. His thumb traced its rim, again and again, a habit he could not remember acquiring.

"*The morning dew*," one of the younger lords recited, "*lingers on the petal's edge—*"

Kaoru stopped listening. The dew did not linger. The dew evaporated. The petal would fall. These men knew this, celebrated it in their verses, and yet they spoke of impermanence as though it were ornament, a pleasing melancholy to be worn like a new hunting robe and set aside when the season turned.

He raised the cup to his lips. The sake was cold.

A servant shuffled forward on his knees, bent nearly double, and placed a folded paper beside Kaoru's elbow. The bark grain was unfamiliar—not the smooth *torinoko* favored at court, but something rougher, fibrous, smelling faintly of sand and a heat that did not belong to this late-autumn evening.

Kaoru set down his cup. His thumb continued its circuit along the ceramic edge for three rotations before he realized he was doing it, and stopped.

The poem inside was written in a woman's hand, though not in the florid style that court ladies practiced until their characters became indistinguishable from one another. This brush moved like water over stone—effortless, inevitable, leaving a clarity that court calligraphy spent years learning to avoid.

*In my garden blooms*  
*a moon that never sets—come,*  
*and I will show you*  
*how beauty outlasts the frost,*  
*outlasts even the watcher.*

His chest tightened. Not at the poem's elegance—though it was elegant—but at its promise. *A moon that never sets.* The words answered something in him that he had not known was asking.

"My lord?" The servant waited, forehead still pressed to the floor. "The messenger said the lady hopes for a reply."

"Who sent this?"

"A retainer from the Seiryō Pavilion, my lord. West of—"

"I know where it is."

Everyone knew where it was. The Seiryō Pavilion had housed minor Fujiwara branches for three generations, each less fortunate than the last. The current owner—if owner was the word for someone who could not afford servants to maintain the gates—was said to be a recluse. Some illness. Some scandal, half-remembered. The sort of person one no longer saw at court functions because one no longer remembered to look.

Kaoru folded the poem again, aligned its edges precisely, and slipped it into his sleeve.

"No reply."

He would go tonight.

---

The ox-cart jolted over a root that had buckled the avenue's paving stones. Kaoru gripped the lacquered frame as the driver called encouragement to the beast, his voice swallowed by darkness filling the gaps between estate walls. Oil lamps had been lit along the main thoroughfare, but here—two streets from the Imperial Palace, yet a world removed from its ceremonial brightness—the great houses stood shuttered and silent.

Rain had fallen earlier. The cart wheels splashed through shallow pools that reflected nothing; no moon, no stars, only the swaying light of his own lantern casting shadows that seemed to move independent of their source.

The air changed first. He noticed it before the cart slowed—a thickness, a stillness, as though they had passed through some membrane separating one season from another. The scent of chrysanthemums should have been everywhere at this time of year, that crisp vegetable bitterness of autumn. Instead, he smelled plum blossoms.

Plum blossoms, which had no business blooming for another four months.

The Seiryō Pavilion's outer walls rose on his left, and Kaoru understood why the place had earned its reputation. Collapse would have been less unsettling than what he saw. The wall had not crumbled—it had rotted, slowly, the plaster sloughing away to reveal wooden bones black with moisture. Moss climbed the exposed beams. A gate hung from a single hinge, caught mid-fall for what might have been years. Beyond it, darkness pooled like ink in a shallow dish.

But the path.

The path leading from the ruined gate to the main hall shone white in the lantern light. White gravel, raked in patterns so precise that each line seemed to glow against the surrounding decay. Not a single leaf marred its surface. Not a single weed had cracked its border.

Kaoru stepped down from the cart. His sandals sank into mud, then found the gravel, and made a sound like teeth grinding.

The driver was already turning the ox. "My lord, I will wait at the crossing of Fourth and—"

"Wait here."

"My lord, this place—"

"Wait."

He walked the white path. On either side, the garden had surrendered to wilderness decades ago—bamboo grown into choking thickets, stone lanterns toppled and swallowed by ferns, a pond visible only as a gleam of stagnant water between overgrown reeds. But the path remained immaculate. Someone had swept it within the hour. Perhaps within the minute.

The Seiryō Pavilion's main hall rose before him, three stories in the old style, its cypress beams polished to a sheen that reflected his lantern back at him like dark water. Screens and blinds hung in perfect alignment. Incense smoke drifted from somewhere inside—plum, again, impossibly, the scent of spring in the throat of autumn.

Movement.

He stopped. His hand found the edge of his folded fan and gripped it, though what he intended to do with a paper fan against whatever moved in that darkness, he could not have said.

A woman knelt on the eastern veranda. She scrubbed small circles against the cypress boards with a cloth that had once been white and was now stained the rust-red of old blood. Her movements were mechanical, relentless—not the careful work of a servant maintaining a household, but something closer to compulsion. Her fingers, visible now as his eyes adjusted, were raw. The skin at her knuckles had cracked and wept. She did not pause. She did not look up.

"I received a poem." His voice came out rougher than he intended. "From this household."

The woman stopped.

For a long moment she remained motionless, her cloth frozen mid-stroke, her body arranged in a stillness so complete that she seemed to have become part of the architecture. Then she raised her head.

Dark hair drawn back severely from her face, a single thick strand escaped and falling across her left brow. Widow's peak. Eyes that were difficult to read in the dim light—one seemed darker than the other, or perhaps it was a trick of the lantern, a pale crescent visible at the upper edge where no iris should have shown such color.

She smiled. The expression did not reach those strange eyes.

"The Lady has been expecting you." Her voice was steady, almost musical, at odds with her bleeding hands. "Please. Follow."

She rose in a single fluid motion and moved toward the main entrance without checking whether he followed. The cloth hung forgotten in her grip, leaving small rust-colored drops on the white path.

Kaoru should have left. The ruined estate, the impossible plum scent, the woman scrubbing her own flesh raw against floorboards that did not need cleaning—these were warnings his body understood even if his mind had not yet assembled them into a coherent fear. His feet remained rooted to the gravel, and for one breath, perhaps two, he stood at the edge of a choice he did not fully perceive.

The Lady's poem rustled against his chest. *A moon that never sets.*

He followed the bloodstained path into the perfect house.

The Attendant led him through corridors that smelled of dust and plum, always plum, until the fragrance thickened into something almost physical. By the time she slid open the panel to the eastern gallery, Kaoru's throat burned with it.

"Please wait here." She bowed, the movement fluid despite the rawness of her hands. "The Lady will speak with you presently."

She withdrew. The panel closed. Kaoru stood alone in a room that should not have existed.

The eastern gallery opened onto a small interior garden, visible through latticed screens that filtered what little moonlight penetrated the overcast sky. Lanterns burned at precise intervals along the veranda—not the sputtering oil lamps of most estates, but something steadier, their flames unnaturally still despite the draft that crept beneath the screens. The tatami beneath his knees was fresh, the woven edge crisp as newly cut grass. Every surface gleamed.

He had seen grand houses before. This was different. Grand houses showed their age in honorable ways—a patina of use, the comfortable wear of generations. This room felt preserved, as though someone had stopped time at the moment of its completion and held it there by force of will.

Behind the *sudare* at the far end of the gallery, a shape moved. Fabric rustling against fabric. The creak of a low table being adjusted.

"You came." The voice that emerged was barely a voice at all—thin, reedy, punctuated by the labored breath of someone for whom speech required effort. "I did not... I was not certain you would."

Kaoru bowed toward the blind, though she could not see him any better than he could see her. "Your poem moved me, my lady. I could not stay away."

A pause. The sound of breathing, rough at the edges.

"The poem," she said. Her voice wavered on the last syllable, as if she were trying to remember something that kept slipping away. "Yes. I... wrote it. I think I wrote it."

The uncertainty should have troubled him. Instead, he found it charming—the humility of a true artist, unable to take credit for what the gods had channeled through her brush. He had met poets who remembered every verse they'd ever composed and recited them at every gathering. This was different. This was genuine.

"Will you honor me with another?" He kept his voice soft, the register he used with nervous horses and grieving widows. "Your words are unlike anything I have encountered at court."

Silence stretched between them. Behind the *sudare*, the shape shifted, and for a moment he thought she would refuse.

Then the voice changed.

"*The watcher at the gate—*"

It was not the same voice. The thin uncertainty had vanished, replaced by something deeper, richer, a timbre that seemed to bypass his ears entirely and settle in the base of his spine. The words came with the inevitability of water finding its level.

"*—does not know the hour.*  
*He counts the falling leaves,*  
*but leaves do not count him.*  
*When the moon outlasts the watcher—*  
*what then?*"

The final syllable hung in the incense-thickened air. Kaoru realized he had stopped breathing. His hands, folded in his lap, had clenched without his permission.

The poetry of the court celebrated beauty. It mourned impermanence. It played elegant games with seasonal imagery and layered allusion. What he had just heard did none of those things. It asked a question that he could not answer—and worse, a question he was not certain he wanted answered.

"My lady," he managed. His voice came out rougher than he intended. "That was—"

"Did I say something beautiful?"

The voice had changed again. Thin. Uncertain. Confused.

"I so rarely..." She trailed off. Behind the blind, the shape seemed smaller suddenly, contracted, as though whatever had filled it a moment ago had withdrawn. "Forgive me. I cannot always remember. The words come, and then they go, and I am... I am not certain which ones I spoke and which ones I only thought."

Something cold moved through Kaoru's chest. Not fear—he did not name it fear—but something adjacent to it, a wrongness that his body registered before his mind could articulate. The woman behind that screen had spoken in two voices. One weak and dying. One clear as a temple bell.

The incense swelled around him, cloying, sweet to the point of rot. Beneath it—beneath the plum, beneath the smoke—something else lurked. Something the perfumed air was working very hard to hide.

He should leave. The thought surfaced clearly, a single bright warning in the fog of his fascination. This house was cursed, or haunted, or something else entirely that priests should examine and nobles should avoid. The woman behind the screen was ill—ill in body, perhaps ill in mind—and he had no business sitting here, breathing this poison air, listening to a voice that was not one voice but two.

He did not leave.

"My lady," he said instead, "may I return tomorrow?"

The pause that followed lasted long enough that he thought she had not heard him, or had heard and would not answer. Then the blind moved—not lifted, but pressed outward from within, as though a hand had rested against it from the other side.

"Yes." The voice was weak again, grateful, almost desperate. "Yes. Please. I have been alone for so very long. The days... the days do not pass here as they should. I think it has been spring for months. Or perhaps years. I cannot—"

She broke off. A dry sound that might have been a cough or might have been a sob.

"I will return," Kaoru said. He rose to his knees, bowed again toward the screen, and began to make his way back through the corridor. The plum scent followed him like a living thing, clinging to his robes, filling his lungs.

At the entrance, the Attendant waited. She did not look at him as she slid the screen aside to let him pass. Her face was composed, blank, the strange pale crescent in her eye invisible in the dim light.

"Thank you," he said, uncertain why he was thanking her.

"The Lady values your company." Her voice carried no inflection. "Your visits bring her... stability."

The word was wrong. He knew it was wrong even as she spoke it. Stability implied something out of balance, something that needed correction. But the Attendant's face revealed nothing, and Kaoru was already stepping out onto the white gravel path, already drawing the night air into lungs that ached for something clean.

Behind him, the perfect house stood silent. The lanterns burned without flickering. The plum trees held their impossible blossoms against the autumn sky.

He would return tomorrow. He could not have said why.

The ninth month came, and the leaves did not fall.

Kaoru noticed it first as an absence of color. The maple along the western corridor should have burned crimson by now—every estate in the capital wore autumn like a new robe, the aristocracy timing their poetry gatherings to catch the peak of each tree's transformation. But here, in the garden of the Seiryō Pavilion, the maple remained stubbornly green. Its leaves hung motionless in air that did not move.

He had been coming every night for three weeks. Perhaps four. Time had begun to fold in on itself, the hours between visits contracting while the moments within the estate stretched like silk pulled too thin. His duties at court—the memoranda he should have drafted, the minor ceremonies he should have attended—had become abstractions, obligations that belonged to a version of himself that no longer quite existed.

Each evening, he brought gifts. Poetry on his finest paper. Incense from the markets near the eastern temple district. A bolt of autumn-colored silk that he had spent three days selecting.

Each evening, the Attendant received them at the gate with a bow so precise it seemed rehearsed beyond any natural movement. She carried them inside without comment. He never saw them again—not displayed, not returned, not acknowledged in any of Hotaru's whispered conversations through the screen. They vanished into the house as completely as sound vanished into its corridors.

Tonight, he had brought a branch of maple. True autumn maple, cut from a tree in the Rokujō gardens, its leaves the exact shade of dried blood. A gift meant to prove something, though he could not have said what.

The Attendant's hands trembled when she took it. Almost imperceptibly—a flutter in her fingers that she corrected immediately—but he saw it. She bowed. The maple branch disappeared with her into the darkness of the service corridor.

Kaoru waited on the veranda. Lady Hotaru's voice drifted from behind the *sudare*, weak tonight, struggling to complete her sentences. The other voice—the clear one, the terrible one—had not appeared in several visits. He found himself waiting for it with something that felt shamefully like anticipation.

"The nights grow cold," Hotaru murmured. "Or perhaps they do not. I cannot always tell. The cold that reaches me seems... old. As though it has been waiting."

"Shall I have more braziers brought?" Kaoru asked.

"No. No, the Attendant manages the warmth. She manages everything. I think sometimes that if she stopped, the house would forget how to exist."

Silence settled between them. No crickets. He had not heard crickets since his first visit. No wind stirred the blinds. The lantern flames burned without flickering, as they always did here, steady as painted fire.

"I brought you autumn," he said. "A branch of maple. Red as—"

"She will take care of it."

The flatness in Hotaru's voice stopped him. He had heard her confused, uncertain, grateful, desperate. He had never heard her sound resigned.

---

The next evening, Kaoru arrived early. The sun had barely set, the sky still holding the last amber light of day, and he walked the white gravel path with the deliberate pace of a man who has decided to pay attention.

The maple branch was gone. Not set aside, not wilted in some forgotten corner—gone, as though it had never existed. In its place, arranged in simple vases along the corridor, fresh green branches held leaves that should not have appeared for another four months. Spring green. The color of new growth in the second month, when plum blossoms gave way to cherry.

He touched one. The leaf was real—waxy, smooth, alive. Impossible.

A sound from the eastern garden. Kaoru moved toward it without thinking, his feet carrying him off the approved paths and into the overgrown wilderness that surrounded the perfect center. Bamboo closed around him. Ferns brushed his robes. The smell of stagnant water reached him, thick and organic.

There—near the collapsed stone lantern, half-hidden by a screen of wild grasses—the Attendant.

She was bent over a pile of ash. In her hands, the remains of his maple branch smoldered, its red leaves curling into gray nothing. Beside her sat a basket of fresh green cuttings, their stems still weeping sap. She was shaking.

Kaoru stopped. The Attendant had not noticed him—or if she had, she gave no sign. Her shoulders rose and fell with breaths that came too fast, too shallow. Her fingers, black with ash, scraped the remains of the maple into a small hole she had dug in the earth. Erasing it. Burying autumn itself.

He should speak. Announce himself. Demand an explanation for this madness, this deliberate destruction of natural time. Instead, he watched.

The Attendant finished her burial. She gathered the green branches, rose unsteadily to her feet, and turned toward the main house. For one terrible moment, her eyes swept across the place where he stood—and saw nothing. Looked through him as though he were not there, or as though he were simply another element of the garden to be managed, corrected, replaced.

Then she was gone, walking with that mechanical grace back toward the perfect corridors.

Kaoru stood in the wild garden, surrounded by decay he was not supposed to have seen. His chest ached. When he breathed, the air seemed to resist him, thick as water. A cough rose in his throat—not the polite clearing of a nobleman in dusty company, but something deeper, wet, concerning.

He ignored it.

---

Later, on the veranda, waiting for Hotaru's voice:

"The garden is so beautiful." She sounded dreamy tonight, half-present. "It never changes. I used to love the seasons—the anticipation of what would bloom next, the mourning when it passed. Now I do not have to mourn. Isn't that better? Isn't it better not to lose things?"

"My lady," Kaoru said carefully, "outside these walls, the leaves have turned. Autumn is at its peak."

Silence.

"Is it?" She sounded genuinely uncertain. "I... I cannot remember what autumn looks like. The colors. I know there are colors. But when I try to see them, I see only green. Only spring. Only—"

Her voice broke. Behind the screen, he heard movement—something being set down, hands pressed against fabric, a sound that might have been a sob muffled by silk.

"Forgive me." The voice had changed. Not to the terrible clarity of the puppeteered verses, but to something smaller, rawer. "I think I used to be different. I think there was a woman who lived here before me, and she loved the passing of things. But that woman is gone, and I do not know where she went, and the Attendant says I must not grieve for her because grieving means acknowledging loss and there can be no loss here, there can be no—"

"My lady—"

"Please come again tomorrow." The voice was hollow now, mechanical. The desperate woman had vanished, replaced by something that spoke with her mouth but no longer seemed to live behind her eyes. "I will be here. I am always here. I do not go anywhere. I cannot go anywhere. The garden is beautiful. The garden never changes. Please come again tomorrow."

Kaoru rose. His hands were trembling. His throat burned—from the incense, from the airless rooms, from something deeper that he did not want to name.

He left the Seiryō Pavilion at a near-run, the white gravel scattering beneath his feet. Behind him, the perfect house stood unchanging, its lanterns burning without flicker, its spring blossoms frozen against the autumn night.

He coughed the entire way home. By the time his ox-cart reached the crossing at Fourth Avenue, his sleeve was spotted with something darker than phlegm.

He would return tomorrow. He could not have said why.

The lamp went out.

Kaoru had been walking the corridor toward the entrance, his mind still caught in the web of Hotaru's voice—the weak one tonight, the one that forgot what it was saying mid-sentence and trailed off into silences that lasted too long. The incense had been particularly heavy, and his chest ached with each breath. He was thinking of nothing except the clean air waiting beyond the gates when the darkness swallowed him.

He stopped. The corridor had no windows; the only light came from oil lamps set in iron brackets along the walls, and the nearest one had simply ceased to burn. No smoke rose from its wick—the flame had not guttered out but vanished, as though it had never existed at all. A cold draft touched his face, carrying the sharp bite of raw lamp oil and something older beneath it, something that smelled of wells and stone.

He should continue to the entrance. The path was simple enough—straight ahead, then right at the garden corner, then through the main gate where his cart waited. He did not need light for that. He had walked it dozens of times.

Instead, he turned toward the service wing.

The Attendant. He wanted to see her before he left. Not for conversation—she rarely spoke more than the necessary courtesies—but to confirm something he could not name. To assure himself that she was still scrubbing, still repairing, still engaged in the endless labor of holding this house together. Her motion was part of the rhythm of this place. Without it, he did not know what the silence would contain.

The service wing branched off to the east, through a low doorway that servants used to move unseen between the kitchens and the main halls. Kaoru ducked his head and entered.

At first he saw nothing. The darkness here was complete, the lamps either unlit or extinguished. Then his eyes adjusted, and he saw her.

The Attendant stood beside a wooden bucket, her hands at her sides. She was not moving. Not breathing, as far as he could tell—her chest neither rose nor fell beneath the plain robes she always wore. The bucket held water; he could see its surface gleaming faintly in what light crept through a high window. But she was not scrubbing. She was not cleaning. She was simply standing, still as furniture, as though someone had placed her there and forgotten to tell her what to do next.

"Attendant?"

His voice came out as barely a whisper. She did not respond.

Kaoru took a step closer. The floorboards creaked beneath him—an actual sound, jarring after the perfect silence of the main halls—and still she did not move. He could see her hands now, hanging loose at her sides. The raw skin at her knuckles had begun to heal, new pink tissue forming over the cracks. She had not been scrubbing. Perhaps for days.

"Are you—"

She looked up.

The woman who met his gaze was not the Attendant. She wore the Attendant's face—the severe widow's peak, the single dark strand falling across the left brow—but the expression behind those features had changed completely. The frantic energy was gone. The mechanical devotion was gone. In its place was something Kaoru had never encountered in any court, any temple, any gathering of the learned men who prided themselves on wisdom: a perfect, clinical stillness.

Her left eye caught what little light filtered through the window, and he saw it clearly for the first time—a crescent of pale green at the upper edge of the iris, vivid as new growth against the deep brown beneath it. The mark should have been beautiful. Instead, it made his stomach turn, as though some fundamental law of how faces should look had been violated.

She tilted her head. The motion was slow, deliberate, and utterly wrong—not the tilt of curiosity but the tilt of assessment, the way a hawk might regard a mouse before deciding whether it was worth the effort to kill.

"You should not be here." Her voice was different. Lower. Smoother. Without the sing-song quality that colored her courtesies. "This is not part of the arrangement."

Kaoru could not move. His feet had rooted themselves to the floorboards. His hands hung at his sides, useless, trembling. Something in his chest had seized—not the cough, not the illness that had been building for weeks, but something older, something his blood remembered even if his mind could not name it.

"Who—"

She blinked.

The change was immediate. The clinical stillness shattered. The woman who remained looked around wildly, her breath coming in sudden gasps, her hands flying to her face as though checking that it was still there. Her eyes—the strange green crescent now invisible in the dim light—swept across the room, across Kaoru, across herself, and found no answers to questions she could not articulate.

"I—" Her voice was the Attendant's again, high and fraying at the edges. "I do not—how did I—"

She ran. There was no other word for it. She gathered her robes and fled through the service corridor, her footsteps receding into the darkness until the house swallowed them entirely and left Kaoru standing alone beside the bucket of still water.

His reflection looked up at him from the surface. A man he barely recognized—pale, hollowed, the robes hanging loose on a frame that had lost weight it could not afford to lose. His hands trembled. His chest ached. His throat burned with incense and something else, something that tasted like iron.

He made his way to the entrance on legs that did not feel like his own. The white gravel path stretched before him, perfect as ever, the lanterns burning with their uncanny steadiness. The spring blossoms hung motionless against the autumn sky.

He understood, now. The house was not merely haunted. Something lived inside the Attendant—something that watched, that waited, that assessed visitors with eyes that did not belong in a human face. And that something knew he had seen it.

He should not return. The thought was clear as temple water, sharp as an unsheathed blade. He should burn his robes, bathe for three days, have priests examine him for any taint that might have followed him home. He should never speak the name of this place again.

But Hotaru's voice echoed in his memory, thin and lost and desperate. *I have been alone for so very long.*

He climbed into his ox-cart. The driver did not ask questions. By the time they reached Fourth Avenue, Kaoru had decided nothing and everything.

He would return tomorrow.

The storm came from the south, moving faster than the messengers who tried to warn the capital. By the time Kaoru heard the first crash of thunder from his chambers in the Rokujō district, the sky had already turned the color of a bruise—purple-black, swollen with a violence that the city's elegant architecture had never been built to withstand.

He should stay inside. The prudent move, the courtier's move, the move that any reasonable man would make when wind began to tear tiles from rooftops. His servants had already secured the shutters. His ox had been led to the covered stables. There was nothing required of him except to wait.

But the Seiryō Pavilion rose in his mind—its perfect corridors, its impossible gardens, its lanterns that burned without flicker. And Hotaru, always behind her screen, whispering fragments of sentences that never quite completed themselves.

*I have been alone for so very long.*

He was running before he realized he had decided to move.

---

The streets had emptied. What remained was chaos—loose debris rolling across the paving stones, shutters torn from their hinges and spinning through the air, the distant screams of those who had not found shelter in time. Rain fell in sheets so thick that Kaoru could barely see ten paces ahead. His robes, soaked through within moments, clung to a body that had grown thin during his weeks of visiting, and each breath came harder than the last.

No ox-cart would run tonight. He went on foot, keeping to the center of the avenues where the wind had less purchase, ducking into covered walkways when the gusts threatened to throw him off his feet. Lightning split the sky in great jagged cracks, and in its light, the city became a thing he did not recognize—all the beauty stripped away, the bones of its architecture exposed and fragile.

The Seiryō Pavilion's gates stood open. Not damaged—simply open, as though someone had forgotten to close them. Kaoru passed through without slowing and found himself on the white gravel path.

It was no longer white. Mud had washed across it in brown waves, obscuring the careful patterns, drowning the perfection in ordinary filth. Branches littered the ground—not the pristine green cuttings he had grown accustomed to, but real autumn debris, leaves the color of rust and fire, torn from trees that had finally been permitted to die.

The main hall loomed ahead, its screens rattling in their frames. Several had already blown in, their paper torn to ribbons that whipped in the wind like the tongues of ghosts.

And there—in the garden—the Attendant.

She was running back and forth along the eastern veranda, her robes drenched, her hair escaped from its bindings and streaming behind her like a dark flag. In her hands she held a wooden shutter, and she was trying—desperately, futilely—to force it back into its frame. The wind tore it from her grip. She caught it. The wind tore it again.

"Stop!" she screamed. Not at him—at the storm itself. "This is not— you cannot— the arrangement—"

Her voice cracked on the last word. She dropped the shutter and grabbed the frame of the veranda with both hands, as though she could hold the house together through will alone. Her fingers, healed from their earlier rawness, now bled fresh where the splintering wood cut into them.

Kaoru climbed onto the veranda. "We have to get inside!"

She turned. Her face was wild—not the clinical stillness he had seen in the service wing, but something worse, something shattered. The manic servant had collided with whatever watched behind her eyes, and the result was chaos.

"You should not be here!" The voice flickered between registers, high and low, desperate and cold. "This was not— I was not finished— there was more time—"

A crack like the world splitting open. The great maple at the garden's edge—the one she had been protecting all these weeks, replacing its leaves with impossible green—toppled. Its trunk, rotted through in ways that no amount of careful maintenance could have hidden, gave way at the base. It fell slowly, almost gracefully, and crashed through the eastern veranda with a sound that Kaoru would hear in his dreams for whatever remained of his life.

The Attendant screamed. Not words—something beyond language, a sound of grief so profound that it seemed to tear itself from her throat against her will. She fell to her knees in the wreckage, her hands scrabbling at the broken wood as though she could somehow put it back.

Kaoru stepped around her. The shattered veranda led to the eastern gallery—Hotaru's gallery, where he had sat so many nights listening to her fractured voice. The *sudare* that had hidden her was gone, ripped away by the wind and wrapped around a fallen beam.

And there, in the grey storm-light, was Lady Hotaru.

She was old. That was the first thing he understood—old in the way that suggested not years but erosion, as though time had worn her down to something barely substantial. Her hair, which he had imagined dark and lustrous, was white and thin, escaping in wisps from a loose braid. Her skin hung loose on bones that seemed too fragile to support even such meager flesh. She huddled in robes that had once been fine but now showed their age in frayed hems and faded colors, the brocade patterns almost invisible beneath years of wear.

She was sick. That was the second thing. The smell hit him even through the rain—old medicine, herbal poultices, the sweet-rot stench of flesh that had begun to fail. Her breathing came in shallow gasps. Her eyes, when she looked up at him, were clouded with cataracts.

She was terrified. That was the third thing, and somehow the worst. She pressed herself against the wall behind her, arms raised as though to ward off a blow, her mouth working around words that would not come. She did not know who he was. She did not know where she was. She knew only that the beautiful lie that had surrounded her had been torn away, and now she was exposed—dying, decaying, *real*—in front of a stranger's eyes.

"Please—" Her voice was nothing like the one he had heard through the screen. Cracked, ruined, barely audible. "Please, I did not ask for— she told me it would be beautiful— she said the poet would love me if I stayed still and let her speak—"

"Do not look!"

The Attendant's voice, behind him. He turned. She stood in the wreckage of the veranda, rain streaming down her face, her eyes flickering between manic and clinical in a way that seemed physically painful to witness.

"Do not look at her! The beauty is still here— I can rebuild it— if you would only stop looking—"

Something broke in Kaoru's chest.

Not the illness that had been building for weeks—something older, something that had calcified around his heart without his knowing. The need for perfect beauty. The hunger for things that did not decay. The compulsion to rescue the ideal from the ordinary wreckage of the world.

He looked at Lady Hotaru—old, sick, terrified, real—and he did not feel revulsion. He felt something that lived on the other side of all his aesthetic obsessions, in a country he had not known existed.

He knelt beside her. The rain poured through the ruined roof, soaking them both. The wind howled. Somewhere behind him, the Attendant was screaming words that no longer mattered.

"I am here," he said. His voice, rough with illness, with incense, with weeks of breathing poison air, came out gentler than he had expected. "I am not leaving."

Lady Hotaru looked at him. Her clouded eyes searched his face for something—deception, perhaps, or the disgust she clearly expected. She found neither.

"I am dying," she whispered.

"Yes." He took her hand. The skin was papery, cold, stretched over bones like bird wings. "I know."

"She—the servant—she said she could make me beautiful again. She said a poet would come, and he would see me as I was, and I would not be alone anymore." Tears cut tracks through the dirt on her face. "But it was never me he saw. It was only what she made."

"I see you now," Kaoru said.

The storm raged. The perfect house collapsed around them in stages, each crash bringing down another section of the impossible preservation. The Attendant's screams had faded—whether she had fled or simply stopped, he could not tell. What mattered was here: an old woman dying, a young man who had learned too late what beauty actually required.

"It's cold," Hotaru murmured.

Kaoru gathered her into his arms. She weighed almost nothing. The shattered ceiling let the rain pour down on them both, washing away the last of the incense, the last of the preservation, the last of everything that had been constructed to hide the truth.

*It is beautiful because it is dying,* he thought. The words rose in him like a verse taking shape. *It was always beautiful because it was dying. I could not see it until now.*

He did not know how long he held her. Minutes. Hours. The storm began to fade, its violence exhausted. Grey light crept through the clouds—not dawn, not yet, but the promise of it.

Lady Hotaru's breathing slowed. Then stopped.

Kaoru remained where he was, cradling her body, surrounded by the ruins of the perfect house. He was shaking. Not from cold—from something else, something that felt like the loosening of chains he had not known he wore.

The Attendant was gone. Where she had fled, he could not guess. Perhaps back into the vessel's original life. Perhaps somewhere else entirely, somewhere beyond the edges of the world.

It did not matter. What mattered was the woman in his arms, and the truth he had finally permitted himself to see.

The storm passed sometime in the hours before dawn. Kaoru did not notice. He had stopped noticing things that did not involve the weight in his arms, the cold that had seeped through his robes and into his bones, the shallow rhythm of his own breathing—each inhale a negotiation with lungs that no longer wanted to cooperate.

Lady Hotaru had grown cold long ago. He knew this the way he knew the color of the sky or the sound of his own name—as a fact that existed independent of his feelings about it. Her body had stiffened, then relaxed again, settling into a stillness that no living person could have held. He had not set her down. He did not intend to.

Grey light crept through the shattered ceiling. Dawn, or something close to it—the sky still heavy with the storm's residue, clouds the color of old silk stretched thin across the horizon. Rain no longer fell, but moisture hung in the air, beading on every surface, turning the ruins of the Seiryō Pavilion into something that glistened like the inside of a shell.

The white gravel path was gone, buried under mud and debris. The perfect gardens had surrendered to chaos—branches scattered like bones, the pond overflowed and mingling with the grounds, the stone lanterns toppled and half-submerged in brown water. Somewhere in the wreckage, the fragments of screens and blinds lay tangled with the remains of silk robes and lacquered boxes that had spilled from storage rooms no one had opened in decades.

And the blossoms. The impossible spring blossoms that the Attendant had maintained through sheer force of will—they lay everywhere, stripped from branches that had finally been permitted to age. Plum petals mixed with mud, their white fading to grey, their edges curling as they began the decay that had been denied them for so long.

Kaoru looked at it all. The ugliness. The truth.

He found it beautiful.

Not in the way he had understood beauty before—not the curated perfection of court gardens, not the arranged elegance of a well-composed poem, not the artificial grace of a woman's voice speaking through a screen. This was a different kind of beauty, raw and terrible and honest. The beauty of things as they actually were, stripped of the constructions that made them bearable.

*It is beautiful because it is dying,* he thought again. The words had settled into him now, taking root. *It was always beautiful because it was dying. The dying was the beauty. I could not see it until now.*

His chest ached. Not metaphorically—a literal, physical pain that radiated from somewhere deep in his lungs, spreading with each shallow breath. The cough that had been building for weeks had become something more. He could taste blood in the back of his throat, could feel the fever burning behind his eyes. The weeks of breathing incense in airless rooms, of walking through gardens saturated with unnatural preservation, of refusing to listen to what his body had been trying to tell him—it had all caught up at once.

He was dying. He knew this the same way he knew the sky and his name. Another fact, independent of feeling.

He did not mind.

The Attendant was gone. He had not seen her since the height of the storm, when she had screamed at him not to look. Perhaps she had fled when her work was destroyed. Perhaps she had simply ceased to exist, her purpose ended. Perhaps she was out there somewhere, wandering the ruined streets of the capital, trying to understand what she had been and what she had lost.

Kaoru did not wonder about her for long. What lived behind her eyes—the clinical watcher, the thing that assessed him like a hawk studying prey—that was a mystery he would not solve in whatever time remained to him. And somehow, it did not seem to matter. The mystery was not the point. The mystery had never been the point.

The point was this: a woman dying in his arms, and his choice to stay.

He had spent his life chasing beauty. Pursuing it across gardens and galleries, through poems and performances, in the faces of women who smiled at him from behind fans. He had believed that beauty existed outside of himself—a treasure to be captured, possessed, preserved against the indignity of decay. He had been wrong.

Beauty was not something you captured. Beauty was something you witnessed. It appeared in the moment of passing, in the space between what was and what would be. It required impermanence the way fire required air. Without the dying, there was nothing to see.

The Attendant had tried to freeze time. She had tried to give him a world without decay, a love without loss, a beauty that never faded. And in doing so, she had created something monstrous—a prison of perfection, a trap built from the very things he thought he wanted.

He understood now why it had felt wrong from the beginning. Why his body had rebelled, why his dreams had turned to nightmares, why every evening in that perfect house had left him more hollowed than the one before. He had been suffocating in the absence of death.

*I will not make this mistake again,* he thought. Then: *Will there be an again?*

The question drifted through his fever-clouded mind. He did not know where it had come from or what it meant. But something in him—something older than memory, something that lived in the spaces between breaths—answered without words.

*Yes. There will be an again. And you will carry this with you.*

The sun rose, eventually. Weak and watery, filtering through clouds that would not fully clear for days. It found Kaoru still sitting in the mud, still cradling the woman who had died in his arms, still breathing—though barely, now, each inhale a shallow gasp that did not quite fill his lungs.

Servants would come soon, perhaps. People from the city, surveying the storm damage, looking for survivors. They would find a young courtier in ruined robes, holding the body of an old woman no one remembered. They would not understand what they were seeing. They would not need to.

Kaoru's eyes drifted closed. The world faded—not to darkness, but to grey, the color of honest light, the color of things as they actually were.

His final thought was not of beauty. Not of poetry. Not of the woman in his arms or the ghost who had tried to trap him.

It was simpler than that. A single, quiet recognition:

*To endure what is real. That is enough. That is everything.*

The fever claimed him gently, like water closing over his head. He did not struggle. He did not cling to the breath that was leaving him. He simply let go—and in the letting go, something settled.

A lesson, planted deep. A seed that would grow in soil he could not yet imagine.

Patience. The strength to endure reality without fleeing into illusion.

Somewhere far away, in a time that had not yet happened, a man would be accused of heresy and tortured for his beliefs. He would endure. He would not break.

And he would not know why he was so certain that truth was worth more than comfort.

But he would be certain.

And that certainty would begin here, in the mud, in the morning, in the arms of a man who had finally learned what beauty required.
