# Period Rules: ch01-contemporary-manchester

Voice, setting, and chapter-specific requirements for Chapter 1: “The Meeting.”

-----

## Historical Setting

- **Period:** Contemporary
- **Location:** Manchester, UK
- **Year:** 2026

-----

## Genre

**Literary Fiction with Supernatural Elements**

Chapter 1 operates as a literary character study that gradually reveals supernatural stakes. The genre requires:

- **Grounded realism** in all physical descriptions, academic settings, and interpersonal dynamics
- **Gradual escalation** from mundane to uncanny—the supernatural emerges through accumulation of unsettling details rather than overt displays
- **Psychological complexity** over spectacle—both protagonists are highly intelligent, self-aware professionals; their conflict plays out through subtext, word choice, and loaded silences
- **Dual POV tension**—readers perceive both characters’ interiority, creating dramatic irony when their understandings diverge
- **Cliffhanger structure**—chapter ends on unresolved tension: will Silas achieve stream-entry, or will Lilith’s positioning succeed?

-----

## Historical Constraints

### Technology (2026)

- Smartphones ubiquitous but not foregrounded; used for calls, not apps
- University still uses physical lecture halls, whiteboards, printed syllabi
- Digital communication exists but scenes emphasize face-to-face interaction
- No AI assistants, smart home devices, or other tech that would date the narrative

### Social Structure

- British academic hierarchy: professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, deans
- NHS mental health services (Lilith’s clinical context)
- University committee culture: course evaluations, interdepartmental politics
- Student-professor power dynamics carefully observed

### Material Culture

- Manchester urban environment: brick buildings, modern additions to Victorian architecture
- Academic dress: rumpled trousers, glasses, wool coats
- Persian restaurant for dinner (cultural specificity for Silas’s background)
- Lilith’s spare flat: functional, minimal, practice-oriented

### Language Rules

- **No Buddhist terminology** in dialogue or narration (constraint applies to all contemporary chapters)
- **No abstract emotion words** (see forbidden list in style-rules.md)
- Academic register for professional scenes; intimate register for private scenes
- British English throughout (grey, colour, aluminium, etc.)
- Silas’s Persian heritage may inflect his idiom subtly but not stereotypically

-----

## Avatar Profile

**Name:** Silas Pahlavan

**Occupation:** Philosophy professor, University of Manchester

**Age:** Early-to-mid 40s (gray creeping into dark brown hair and beard)

**Physical Description:**

- Oval face, sharp nose, well-defined jawline
- Blue eyes behind gold-framed glasses
- Dark brown hair and beard with gray streaks
- Rumpled academic dress

**Mantra/Ritual:** “I am boundless awareness” (repeated throughout chapter as grounding affirmation)

**Core Flaw (this life):** Compulsive helping—attachment to being the one who fixes, saves, guides. Manifests as:

- Running toward Stewart’s breakdown without hesitation
- “Seemingly limitless patience” with students
- Positioning himself as the calm center in crisis

**Spiritual Status:** Approaching stream-entry; has intellectual mastery of Eastern philosophy but has not yet broken the three fetters (self-illusion, doubt, attachment to rites/rituals)

**Recognition Markers (for reader continuity):**

- Patience and observation (echoes Ka’s “watches, learns”)
- Automatic helping response
- Physical stillness under pressure

**Key Moment:** Stewart’s breakdown triggers genuine insight—“I am not that, and I am also not ‘not that’”—a glimpse beyond conceptual understanding

-----

## Lilith in This Chapter

**Power Level:** Full presence in present timeline; decade of tracking complete

**Capabilities:** Can appear completely in present timeline; all powers at peak in human realm; intimate access through established relationship

**Method:** Positioned as Silas’s lover; uses intimacy, intellectual sparring, and clinical expertise to influence and observe

**Objective (Chapter 1):** Positioning for final intervention. She is:

- Testing how close he is to breakthrough
- Introducing a “mindfulness technique” designed to “bound” his awareness (ambiguous whether helpful or sabotage)
- Observing his response to Stewart’s breakdown for signs of progress
- Maintaining intimate access while preparing escalation

**Emotional State:** Complex—ten years of effort approaching culmination. Surface confidence masking:

- Fear when she sees insight “steal across his face”
- Deflated manner when he articulates “I am not that, and I am also not ‘not that’”
- The smile that holds “both allure and a hint of something colder, ancient and predatory”

**Physical Tells:**

- Hair brushed away from face in gesture “both innocent and calculated”
- Eyes widening in “what would have been mistaken for anticipation… it betrayed fear”
- Shoulders relaxing only when she confirms he’s “still adjusting”

**Dramatic Function:** Readers should sense something is wrong before understanding what—her reactions don’t quite match a supportive partner

-----

## Thematic Requirements

### Meat/Body Theme

Chapter 1 must establish the body as site of knowledge and transformation:

- Post-coital bodies: spent, aching, desirous
- Stewart’s stripping: rejection of physical identity
- Silas’s physical stillness as spiritual practice
- Past-life memories arriving through body sensation (numb fingers, blood taste)

### Duality/Non-Duality Theme

Central philosophical thread must be planted:

- “Tat tvam asi” (That thou art) vs. Stewart’s “I am not that!”
- Silas’s synthesis: “I am not that, and I am also not ‘not that’”
- Lilith’s confirmation that transcends the dichotomy
- The game of “metaphysical pillow talk” becoming “terrifyingly real”

### Recognition Pattern

First chapter plants the recognition that will recur across lifetimes:

- Silas sees Lilith’s eyes “in another place, another rainy night”
- The Buick Roadmaster memory (1930s detective life)
- Lilith’s face remains constant across visions
- Readers learn to watch for her before avatars recognize her

-----

## Revision Notes

**Strengths in Current Draft:**

- Voice patterns strongly established
- Undermining clauses consistently deployed
- Physical anchoring present throughout
- Dual POV transitions clear
- Cliffhanger structure effective

**Areas for Revision:**

- Some abstract emotion words may have slipped through (audit needed)
- Committee meeting scene could use more physical grounding
- Lilith’s physical tells could be more consistently tracked
- Ensure no Buddhist terminology appears (even in Silas’s Eastern philosophy lecture—he should use Sanskrit terms with English glosses, not Pali Buddhist vocabulary)
