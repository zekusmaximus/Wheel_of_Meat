That business continued later in the morning in the lecture hall, where Silas collected assignments and began the unit of his course on Eastern philosophy. "Today we are leaving behind the objective, linear thinking we have been looking at in this course so far for the subjective, cyclical explorations of Eastern philosophy."

The long windows of the hall sent the morning light into his eyes. He shaded them to look out at the students packed into the tiers of seats, rising away from him, as their attention did the longer he spoke. He caught Stewart's glare from near the top of the hall, unable to tell if it was one of anger, disappointment or resignation. Turning to the whiteboard, he wrote 'TAT TVAM ASI' in quick, squeaky strokes.

Keystrokes and pen scribbles sounded out as the students added the phrase to their notes. Silas tapped each of the three words in succession. "That. Thou. Art." Even with his voice raised and the keyboards clicking once more, he could clearly make out another conversation erupting among some students.

Silas shielded his eyes from the sunlight again as he peered out to see the commotion. "Is he ok?" "Does he seem ok?" "He needs help." "Professor?" Above it all, a single phrase repeated and grew in volume. "I am not that!" Stewart was standing, removing his t-shirt, having already tossed his sweatshirt at the row of students in front of him.

Without thinking, a look of concern and empathy stealing over his face, Silas instructed his teaching assistant to call for Miss Azami and ran up the stairs. Stewart's fellow students had already cleared the surrounding seats, but having done so put themselves in the path to him. Turning to the side and putting his hand out before him, Silas cleared a path as he watched Stewart kick off the last leg of his jeans.

"Stewart, look at me." Silas reached the aisle, students around him breathing a sigh of relief as it became apparent Stewart would not remove his underwear next. "Stewart, look at me."

"I am not that!" The skinny kid in his boxers was screaming, arms wide and gaze focused on the whiteboard. Silas inched closer to Stewart, trying to get his attention, occasionally turning to shake his head at the snickering students, trying unsuccessfully to get them to stop from laughing out loud.

"Class dismissed. Read Chapter 6 of the Chandogya Upanishad for next time." Silas noticed a small cheer as he motioned the students to leave and sat down a few chairs from where Stewart was still screaming.

"I am not that!" Again and again Stewart insisted, his voice lowering from a scream to a soft insistent chant. Silas remained almost impossibly calm, eyes remaining forward, not turning to look at the near naked teenager, letting him run out of steam on his own. Noticing Lilith come into the hall followed by a campus security officer, Silas clapped three times, sharply, loudly.

Stewart turned, one last "I am not that" escaping in a whisper as he collapsed into his seat. Silas nodded and smiled knowingly, almost lovingly, not losing eye contact with the distressed student. Lilith approached from the other side, slowly.

"Stewart? Stewart Sheldon?" Lilith drew his attention to her, leaving Silas breathing a sigh of relief as he stood and walked back toward the stairs, beckoning the security officer to approach him rather than Stewart and Lilith. The security guard's shoulders dropped, releasing tension upon noting that Silas had complete faith in Lilith's ability to handle the situation.

Lilith sat down next to Stewart, handing him the jeans and t-shirt she had collected on her way over to him. She spoke in a calm, reassuring tone, one she recognized now as she used it to diffuse the situation and assess the student. It was the tone Silas often achieved in conversations with her. She turned her attention down to where Silas and the security officer were quietly discussing what had happened during the class.

Silas noticed her looking at him, remembering how she had seen his interaction with Stewart earlier that morning. He turned again to the whiteboard and Lilith noticed something click in him as he shook his head and muttered Stewart's insight. "I am not that." A wave of release washed over Silas. A weight he didn't know he had been carrying suddenly vanished, a profound peace almost lifting him from the ground.

The look and words sent a visible shudder through Lilith as she walked Stewart toward the door while he clumsily put his clothes back on. She looked up at Silas as if in frustration at not having been able to delay the breakthrough. Despair mixed with respect for his unwavering spirit. Silas stared back, apparently lost in his transformation, the realization that he possessed no thou that could be that.

The security officer collected the backpack and sweatshirt Stewart had left behind and couldn't help but notice the intense moment Silas and Lilith shared from across the hall.
