The sunset painted warning colors across Lilith's skin as she sat on the edge of the bed, her silhouette a dark promise against the dying light. Silas dozed behind her, his breath shallow and uneven. He remained unaware or uncaring that their game of metaphysical pillow talk was about to become, as it always was and always would be, terrifyingly real.

"Do you know how many lives you've lived to reach this place? How many times you screamed coming out of a bloody womb? How many times you died cold and alone?" Her voice a silken caress, a sharp glint in her eyes. She ran her fingers along his back, and he stirred, his muscles protesting with a dull ache as he rolled over to face her, eyelids heavy. The humid room smelled of sweat and perfume. The chatter and traffic of the city rode the warm breeze through the open window.

"No." His gaze slid over her with a flicker of exhaustion and lingering desire.

"I do." She slipped off the bed and walked over to the window. The setting sun played upon her naked body, painting her skin with hues of gold and crimson. She brushed her damp hair away from her face, and it fell, sticking to the back of her neck, a gesture that seemed both innocent and calculated.

"Where, pray tell, did you come by that information?" His voice was hoarse as he reached for the glass of tepid water on the nightstand. They played this game every time, fanciful conversation was the only thing their spent bodies had the energy for.

She turned, looking at him. Her lips curved into a slow smile that held both allure and a hint of something colder, ancient and predatory. "I have seen them." Her voice a breath of warning.

He edged his legs off the bed and stretched, setting the glass down. "Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes." His tone challenging as he held out his hand to her.

"Our friend Jung, the embodied consummation of our vocations." She danced into the bathroom, waving his hand away dismissively, closing the door behind her. She the psychiatrist, he the philosopher.

After pulling on his rumpled pants from the floor, he walked to the mirror. Silas Phalavan smiled as he noted the slight streaks of gray creeping into his dark brown hair and beard. She said it complimented his oval face, sharp nose and well-defined jawline. His hand moved automatically up to that jaw as he turned his face to the side, letting Lilith's strange pronouncement simmer in his mind. The ritual affirmation he found so soothing formed on his lips, "I am boundless awareness".

Inspecting his face, his own blue eyes seemed to whisper of those lives. The gold frame of his glasses boundaries around lessons learned, forgotten and learned again. The hairs on his neck appeared to rise at an imminent revelation within him, until his watch chimed, announcing it was time to leave for dinner.

"Miss Azami." He walked over to the bathroom door and knocked, his voice returning to its natural hoarseness, the sound of his footsteps on the hardwood floor obscuring the epiphany. "Our chariot awaits."

The closed door muffled her voice. "I thought our reservation was at nine." The Walnut Persian Restaurant was a twenty-minute ride at least, but she didn't care. The nights in Manchester were meant to be just a bit behind schedule.
