Silas tried Lilith's practice when they returned to her apartment, while she insisted on drying her hair. His affirmation continued to run in his mind, as if given new depth since his recent revelations. The noise of the hair dryer permeated the room despite the torrential downfall and occasional rumble of thunder outside.

Watching him as she finished up, Lilith sat in a chair across from him. The slight smell of wet hair lingered. His posture was impeccable, his concentration complete. The moment seemed to stretch as she closed her eyes and appeared to slip into a practice of her own. The lights in the room became impossibly bright, yet neither of them noticed.

They sat like that a while, calm, serene, deep in their practice. Two beings breathing, across from each other in physical space, entangled in spirit. The very air charged with an energy which swirled about them, both inside and out. He looked deep into her eyes, entranced as he often had been by their limitlessness.

The apprehension in her eyes wasn't apparent. To Silas it was an expectant look, as if she was wondering if the meditation technique was working. His affirmation slipped as something else betrayed itself in her gaze.

He shuddered as he recognized those eyes, in another place. Another rainy night, a different city, a passerby. Lilith, but not Lilith, rushing to avoid an antique car. The car was a brand new Buick Roadmaster. "Not antique." He verbalized the thought as Lilith shook her head, agreeing that it was not. Their conversation from that morning came back to him.

"….how many times I died cold and alone." Something more powerful than his mantra took hold of him as he uttered the phrase. He noticed his fingers numb as if from frostbite, the taste of blood in his mouth, a whisper in a foreign language he somehow understood. Impressions one after the other, so real.

They were real. They were his experiences, lived in other times, other lives. He focused on Lilith again, she knew. "You have seen them."

Her shoulders relaxed. After a pause she replied. "I have." She stood up immediately and turned away from him. "You're still adjusting. The meditation was deep. Let's focus on that. Your breath, your body, your surroundings."

The room came back into full focus as Silas found his breath. "I am boundless…" He couldn't finish.

Lilith was walking toward the other room when her phone rang. A loud peel of thunder interrupted the beginning of the conversation. Silas looked outside at the pouring rain, his head suddenly clear again. Lilith picked up her coat. "I'll be right there."
