Silas was reciting his affirmation, currently aloud, when he bumped into Lilith later that evening, walking through University Green. They were the only two around in the twilight as dark clouds obscured the sunset, threatening rain.

"Quite the show at the meeting today." Stopping in front of him Lilith waved her hand, dismissing his statement. He persisted. "I didn't know you were so passionate about student evaluations."

She shook her head and smiled. The street lights flickered to life, the darkness encroaching enough to trigger their sensors. "Look at you Silas, so sure of yourself." Motioning to a bench she walked to it and sat, looking up at him, concern wiping away the smile which had been so disarming mere moments before.

Silas did not sit, but followed and stood over her, taking the opportunity to shake his own head. He shone under the fluorescent lamp, distant thunder drawing their attention as it pealed over the horizon. "Storm coming." Lilith nodded in agreement and patted the seat next to her on the bench. Finally sitting Silas exhaled a bit too loudly, releasing some tension that remained in him.

"What is it Lilith? Something not fitting the patterns of all those past lives you've seen?" The chuckle that followed failed to convince Lilith he was simply trying to lighten the mood, which indeed he was not. Her brow furrowed even more.

"Did you book a time with Ellen?" Her hand reached out to place itself on his hands, themselves folded on his lap, but they pulled away, leaving hers brushing his leg and withdrawing. "I care about you, Silas. Perhaps too much."

The words of his affirmation almost formed on his lips as he turned away and sighed. A small wind picked up as the air moistened, bringing the slightly sweet smell of impending precipitation. "I know Lilith, but as I said this afternoon, you have nothing to worry about." Her hand, more persistent this time, gently tugged his chin, turning his face back toward her.

"You said Stewart showed you something. What did he show you, Silas?" She looked at him, eyes widening in what would have been mistaken for anticipation by someone less perceptive. Instead, when combined with her tight lips and stiffened posture, it betrayed fear.

A woman opened her umbrella as she walked by, the clicking and whooshing sound drawing Silas and Lilith's attention for a moment. They both shifted on the bench to watch before focusing on one another again.

"Oddly enough, you may be the only person I know who might understand." Silas took a deep breath before continuing. "It was more the situation than Stewart, poor kid. Lilith, I realized I am not that, and I am also not 'not that'." He shook his head and laughed. The uneasy mirth his seemingly nonsensical statement brought about in him shifted as he noticed Lilith nodding in complete understanding.

"No Silas, you are not." Her eyes looked down and away as a brief frown seemed to deflate her usually confident manner. She was thinking, eyes looking first this way then that, the muscles in her striking face tensing, releasing. "You haven't been for a very long time."

"For many lifetimes?" His quip was a half-hearted attempt to return to the levity of their usual banter. It was ineffective. Lilith looked about, noticing the appearance of a few raindrops here and there, hitting the bench, the walkway.

"I have a new practice for you, to complement your mantra." The smile was back, her eyes bright in the way they were when they had first met. A single drop of rain from the sky hit her cheek, glistening as it rolled down. "It's a mindfulness technique. Nothing religious, but hard to master."

Silas wiped a raindrop from her cheek as a few more fell around them. Thunder clapped, much closer. He stood, looking up into the sky with wonder. "I am boundless awareness."

"That you are." She stood next to him, placing her hands on in shoulders, looking through the drops into his eyes. "This practice will bound that awareness." Lilith tapped his chest, pointing at his heart. "A new habit to overcome the habitual."
