Mornings in Manchester were a different story, especially following on the heels of behind schedule nights. Memories of the restaurant and what followed crowded Lilith's mind as she made her way across campus in the early light. It reflected off the modern additions to the historic buildings, onto her face and the empty pathways awaiting the morning rush.

Silas walked towards her, heading to his office in the Arthur Lewis Building, seeming to avert his gaze when she came into view. When he seemed not to notice her, hesitation in her stride suggested her mention of his past lives the night before might have been a mistake. Lilith narrowed her eyes as if preparing to feel Silas out as a student barreled past her, almost nudging her out of his way.

"Professor Phalavan!" The student quickened his pace even further as he closed the distance with Silas. They were already in conversation as Lilith approached. Whether Silas had taken her confession seriously the prior evening, or had given it any further thought, would remain a mystery for now.

She neared him as he argued with the student over a late assignment. He gave only a cursory look toward her, a slight nod of recognition as he informed the student he couldn't make exceptions.

"I'll see you at our lecture later, Stewart," he said, cutting off the student's desperate protestations. He glanced at the red brick facade of the Arthur Lewis Building longingly, as if anticipating the much needed coffee awaiting him within. Silas then returned his attention to Stewart, his resolve softened by his seemingly limitless patience. "Or you can always come to office hours."

Lilith walked past them and continued to the Crawford House, already having satisfied her own morning craving for caffeine. Her pace picked back up as if a new resolve had taken hold. She looked back, noticing the distance between her and Silas widening as cars passed by on the street and the campus went about its business.
