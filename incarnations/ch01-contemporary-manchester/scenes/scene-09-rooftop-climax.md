Stewart turned at the sound of the door, and in the city's ambient glow, Silas could see he wasn't the same young man who'd stripped in the lecture hall that morning. The desperation was gone. In its place, something worse—a terrible clarity that settled across his features like frost.

"Professor Phalavan." The words carried no surprise, no distress. An observation, nothing more. "I thought they might send you."

The rain had gentled to a mist that hung in the air rather than fell through it, catching the light from below and turning the rooftop into something between worlds. Silas took a step forward, feeling Lilith close behind him but not looking back.

"Stewart." He kept his voice even, the professional calm that had served him in the lecture hall. "Let's talk about what's happening."

"What's happening?" Stewart's laugh was soft, almost wondering. He stood perhaps fifteen feet from the barrier, his hospital bracelet still visible on his wrist, his clothes soaked through. "Nothing's happening, Professor. That's the whole point. Nothing has ever been happening. I finally understand that."

Another step. Silas could feel the training activating—crisis intervention, the careful approach, the measured tone. But beneath the technique, something else stirred. The flashbacks pulsed at the edges of his vision, threatening to pull him out of this moment and into others that belonged to lifetimes he couldn't remember living.

"You left the hospital." State the obvious. Ground the conversation in facts. "People are worried about you."

"People." Stewart turned slightly, not toward Silas but toward the city spread below—the lights of Manchester arranged in patterns that meant nothing, signified nothing. "People are worried about the person they think I am. But that person doesn't exist. You taught me that this morning, Professor."

The words landed with more force than Stewart could have intended. Silas felt them settle in his chest, next to the hollow space where his mantra used to live.

"I taught you philosophy, Stewart. Ideas to consider. Not conclusions to act on."

"Didn't you?" Now Stewart did turn, and his eyes caught the reflected light from below. "What you wrote on the board. What you taught us. Something in me—" He pressed his hand against his sternum, a gesture Silas recognized because he'd made it himself, in the lecture hall, in the committee room, in Lilith's apartment. "Something broke. Or maybe it finally stopped pretending to be whole."

Lilith shifted behind him, and Silas heard her breath catch. She should be stepping forward now. She was the clinician. This was her domain. But she remained where she was, frozen at the edge of his peripheral vision.

"What broke, Stewart?"

"The lie." He said it simply, without drama. "I am not my grades. I figured that out first, and it was almost a relief. I am not my parents' expectations. That took longer to accept. I am not my future, because what future? I am not even my thoughts, because who's watching the thoughts if there's no one here to watch?"

The mist was thinning now, the storm exhausting itself against the city. Somewhere below, a siren wailed and faded.

"So I kept going." Stewart's voice remained conversational, as if they were discussing chapter six in a seminar room. "If I'm not that, and I'm not that, and I'm not that—what's left? What's the thing underneath all the things I'm not?"

Silas knew the answer. Had taught the answer. Had believed the answer for years before this morning, when Stewart's screaming had cracked something open that couldn't be sealed again.

"Nothing." Stewart smiled, and the smile was worse than the words. "Nothing's left. Just awareness aware of itself being aware, which sounds profound until you realize it's just another way of saying there's no one home. Never was. The whole show—" He gestured at the city, at the sky, at himself. "—performed for an audience that doesn't exist."

"That's not—" Silas started, but the rebuttal died before it formed. Because how could he argue? He'd felt the same dissolution in the lecture hall, the same groundless ground opening beneath his sense of self. The difference was that for him, the opening had felt like release. For Stewart, it felt like annihilation.

"You seemed so at peace with it." Stewart's voice softened, genuine curiosity replacing the terrible calm. "In the lecture. When you looked at what I'd written on myself by accident. You smiled, Professor. Like you'd found something wonderful. How do you accept being nothing and still want to stay?"

The question struck home. Silas searched for an answer—in his training, in his philosophy, in the practices that had suddenly revealed themselves as prisons rather than paths—and found only silence.

He'd spent his career teaching people to question the self, to loosen their grip on identity, to see through the illusion of a permanent, unchanging I. But he'd never considered what happened when someone saw through it too fast, without the foundation of something to stand on while the old floor fell away.

"I don't know," he said. The honesty surprised him. "Stewart, I don't know how to answer that."

Stewart nodded, as if this were the response he'd expected. "She told me I was having a break from reality." He looked past Silas to where Lilith stood motionless. "That what I understood wasn't understanding at all. Just neurons misfiring. Chemistry gone wrong."

Silas turned, finally, to look at her. Lilith's face held an expression he'd never seen—not the clinical mask, not the calculating concern, but something rawer. Her hands were clenched at her sides, and in the city light, he could see fine tremors running through her shoulders.

"Was she right, Professor?"

He turned back to Stewart, the question hanging between them like the mist that still clung to the air. The young man who'd stripped naked and screamed in a lecture hall stood at the edge of a building, asking if his insight was illness or awakening, and Silas—who had spent the day having the same insight without the same terror—found he couldn't answer.

"I don't think it's that simple." The words came slowly, feeling their way through a darkness he couldn't map. "What you saw this morning—what I saw—it's not wrong. But it's not complete either."

"Complete." Stewart tasted the word. "What's missing, then? What comes after you realize there's nothing here?"

Behind him, Silas heard a small sound from Lilith—a catch of breath that might have been a sob if she'd allowed it to complete. He didn't turn. Couldn't turn. Something was happening in his chest, a loosening he recognized from the lecture hall but deeper now, more dangerous.

The helper identity. The compulsion to be the one who saves, who fixes, who guides others through their darkness. He'd carried it so long he'd forgotten it was separate from him—but it wasn't him, was it? It was just another costume, another role, another thing he was not.

And here it was, fully activated, straining toward Stewart with every technique and reassurance it had accumulated over decades. The urge to close the distance, to offer the right words, to be the professor who talked the student down from the ledge.

But the urge itself was the problem. He could feel it now like a harness around his chest, pulling him forward—could see it as clearly as Stewart's silhouette against the lights below. The need to help was attachment. The identity of helper was still identity, still self, still the illusion that kept him bound to the wheel. To step out of it now would be to truly let go. It would be the final surrender. And it would mean leaving Stewart utterly alone.

Stewart had seen through himself and found nothing. Silas had seen through himself and found something else—but what? What remained when even the desire to save was recognized as another mask?

"Professor?" Stewart's voice cut through his dissolution. "You went somewhere just now."

"I'm here." But was he? The boundaries felt uncertain—between himself and Stewart, between Stewart and the city lights, between this moment and all the other moments his flashbacks had shown him through the evening. Lilith's face across time. Blood in his mouth from lives he couldn't remember. The sensation of dissolution without the terror, falling without a floor but somehow not falling.

The storm had broken. The rain had stopped. The mist remained, but lighter now, and through it, Silas could see Stewart more clearly than before. The young man's hand rested on the barrier wall—not gripping, just touching, as if testing its reality.

"There's something I haven't told you." Stewart's voice had changed, the terrible calm giving way to something almost tender. "When I was screaming in the lecture hall, when everyone was staring and you were walking toward me—I could feel you. Not just see you. Feel you. Like we were the same thing, looking at itself from two directions."

Silas's breath stopped.

"That's when I knew you understood. That's when I knew it wasn't just me losing my mind. We're not separate, Professor. We never were. The boundaries are just another part of the lie."

The words echoed something Silas had thought in Lilith's apartment, something about the barrier between self and other already blurring. He'd assumed it was metaphor, philosophy made experiential. But Stewart was saying it literally, as a lived fact.

"The problem is," Stewart continued, and his hand moved slightly on the barrier wall, "if we're not separate, then nothing I do matters to anyone else, because there isn't anyone else. And nothing anyone else does matters to me, because there isn't a me." He looked down at the city. "So why stay? Why keep pretending there's someone here who needs to keep breathing?"

Lilith made another sound behind him. Sharper this time, almost a gasp. Silas heard her take a step forward, then stop. When he glanced back, he saw something cross her face he couldn't read: not the concern of a clinician, not the calculation of whatever game she'd been playing. Something more like recognition. The horror of seeing her own fear of emptiness mirrored in this boy, the consequence of techniques meant to constrain rather than liberate. Something more like loss.

She should be acting. This was her patient, her responsibility, her professional domain. But she stood frozen, arms half-raised as if to reach for someone who wasn't there.

The thunder was distant now, a retreating complaint from a storm that had spent its fury. In the silence it left behind, Stewart turned back toward the barrier.

"You were right, Professor."

Silas took a step forward, and the step felt different from the ones that had come before—not the helper rushing to save, not the professional managing a crisis, but something stripped of role and purpose moving toward something else equally stripped.

"Stewart—"

"Tat tvam asi." Stewart's hand left the barrier. He turned toward Silas—toward connection, it seemed, toward the recognition of their shared unreality. "That thou—"

But the turn carried him. His foot found the barrier's base, and what had been a pivot became a stumble, and what had been a stumble became gravity taking hold of what balance had released.

Silas lunged.

The distance between them collapsed—fifteen feet, ten, five—and time stretched in the way time stretches only at the threshold of irreversible things. Stewart's body was past the barrier now, the city lights reflecting in his eyes, his hand reaching back toward the rooftop, toward Silas, toward the connection he'd been trying to articulate.

Silas's own hand extended, the helper identity's final act or something beyond it—the boundary between self and other already blurring, already meaningless, already collapsed into a single gesture that was both reaching and being reached for.

The mist caught the light from below. Stewart's fingers spread wide, pale against the darkness. Silas felt the edge of the barrier press against his hip as he leaned over, farther than balance should allow, farther than sense would permit.

Their fingers touched, or didn't, and the rain had stopped.
