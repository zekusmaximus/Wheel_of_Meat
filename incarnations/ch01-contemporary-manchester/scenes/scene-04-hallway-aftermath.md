It was a moment that neither had forgotten when they bumped into each other in the empty academic hallway a little while later. The afternoon shadows played through the stained glass windows as they met. Dark wood paneling covered the wall behind the bench where they turned to sit. Lilith drew close to Silas, placing her hand on his knee.

"How's Stewart?" She could hear the genuine concern in his voice.

"Broken." Silas nodded and turned from her. "You handled the situation well, Silas. How are you doing?"

"Lilith…" His words didn't seem to come. She patted his knee as he looked back to her.

"I'll make you an appointment with Ellen." Lilith leaned in toward him, an easy empathy almost contrived. "You should talk through the experience. You seem shaken."

Silas shook his head, his glasses sliding down his nose. "That's just it. I'm not shaken Lilith." She pulled back a bit as he pushed his glasses back up, smiling. "I think Stewart showed me something. Something about myself, or lack thereof."

Her eyes could have been mistaken as betraying sadness, when it was actually worry they tried to hide. "You know this is where I caution you not to mistake an emotional response to a traumatic event with genuine spiritual insight."

The soft laugh that escaped him took them both by surprise. Lilith stood, as if her attempts at intimacy through proximity had proved fruitless. "Ellen will just tell me to journal about it, meditate on it, maybe take some time off."

"She's a professional Silas, as are you." Lilith was growing short with him, taking a step back, looking past him down the hallway as if wishing someone would come along to intrude on their private moment. "She wouldn't be wrong."

He stood up himself, clearing his throat, his own look of resolve mirroring the one Lilith had shown that morning during his confrontation with Stewart. "No, she wouldn't."

Lilith straightened her jacket, then reached out to the tweed that Silas wore, running her hands down his chest as if attempting to press out the ever-present wrinkles. Her attempt at closeness fell flat though, Silas placing his own hands on her shoulders, looking into her eyes. "I'll take a meeting with Ellen later this week. Now I have to prepare for our faculty meeting this afternoon."

He was too confident, and they both knew it. Lilith nodded and turned around, lost in her growing concern over his spiritual progress as he walked slowly behind her, lost in his dreams of continuing it. The buzz of the air conditioner fought the rare afternoon heat in Manchester, attempting to cool too much space with too little cold air.
