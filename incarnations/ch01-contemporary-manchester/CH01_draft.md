The sunset painted warning colors across Lilith's skin as she sat on the edge of the bed, her silhouette a dark promise against the dying light. Silas dozed behind her, his breath shallow and uneven. He remained unaware or uncaring that their game of metaphysical pillow talk was about to become, as it always was and always would be, terrifyingly real.

"Do you know how many lives you've lived to reach this place? How many times you screamed coming out of a bloody womb? How many times you died cold and alone?" Her voice a silken caress, a sharp glint in her eyes. She ran her fingers along his back, and he stirred, his muscles protesting with a dull ache as he rolled over to face her, eyelids heavy. The humid room smelled of sweat and perfume. The chatter and traffic of the city rode the warm breeze through the open window.

"No." His gaze slid over her with a flicker of exhaustion and lingering desire.

"I do." She slipped off the bed and walked over to the window. The setting sun played upon her naked body, painting her skin with hues of gold and crimson. She brushed her damp hair away from her face, and it fell, sticking to the back of her neck, a gesture that seemed both innocent and calculated.

"Where, pray tell, did you come by that information?" His voice was hoarse as he reached for the glass of tepid water on the nightstand. They played this game every time, fanciful conversation was the only thing their spent bodies had the energy for.

She turned, looking at him. Her lips curved into a slow smile that held both allure and a hint of something colder, ancient and predatory. "I have seen them." Her voice a breath of warning.

He edged his legs off the bed and stretched, setting the glass down. "Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes." His tone challenging as he held out his hand to her.

"Our friend Jung, the embodied consummation of our vocations." She danced into the bathroom, waving his hand away dismissively, closing the door behind her. She the psychiatrist, he the philosopher.

After pulling on his rumpled pants from the floor, he walked to the mirror. Silas Phalavan smiled as he noted the slight streaks of gray creeping into his dark brown hair and beard. She said it complimented his oval face, sharp nose and well-defined jawline. His hand moved automatically up to that jaw as he turned his face to the side, letting Lilith's strange pronouncement simmer in his mind. The ritual affirmation he found so soothing formed on his lips, "I am boundless awareness".

Inspecting his face, his own blue eyes seemed to whisper of those lives. The gold frame of his glasses boundaries around lessons learned, forgotten and learned again. The hairs on his neck appeared to rise at an imminent revelation within him, until his watch chimed, announcing it was time to leave for dinner.

"Miss Azami." He walked over to the bathroom door and knocked, his voice returning to its natural hoarseness, the sound of his footsteps on the hardwood floor obscuring the epiphany. "Our chariot awaits."

The closed door muffled her voice. "I thought our reservation was at nine." The Walnut Persian Restaurant was a twenty-minute ride at least, but she didn't care. The nights in Manchester were meant to be just a bit behind schedule.


Mornings in Manchester were a different story, especially following on the heels of behind schedule nights. Memories of the restaurant and what followed crowded Lilith's mind as she made her way across campus in the early light. It reflected off the modern additions to the historic buildings, onto her face and the empty pathways awaiting the morning rush.

Silas walked towards her, heading to his office in the Arthur Lewis Building, seeming to avert his gaze when she came into view. When he seemed not to notice her, hesitation in her stride suggested her mention of his past lives the night before might have been a mistake. Lilith narrowed her eyes as if preparing to feel Silas out as a student barreled past her, almost nudging her out of his way.

"Professor Phalavan!" The student quickened his pace even further as he closed the distance with Silas. They were already in conversation as Lilith approached. Whether Silas had taken her confession seriously the prior evening, or had given it any further thought, would remain a mystery for now.

She neared him as he argued with the student over a late assignment. He gave only a cursory look toward her, a slight nod of recognition as he informed the student he couldn't make exceptions.

"I'll see you at our lecture later, Stewart," he said, cutting off the student's desperate protestations. He glanced at the red brick facade of the Arthur Lewis Building longingly, as if anticipating the much needed coffee awaiting him within. Silas then returned his attention to Stewart, his resolve softened by his seemingly limitless patience. "Or you can always come to office hours."

Lilith walked past them and continued to the Crawford House, already having satisfied her own morning craving for caffeine. Her pace picked back up as if a new resolve had taken hold. She looked back, noticing the distance between her and Silas widening as cars passed by on the street and the campus went about its business.


That business continued later in the morning in the lecture hall, where Silas collected assignments and began the unit of his course on Eastern philosophy. "Today we are leaving behind the objective, linear thinking we have been looking at in this course so far for the subjective, cyclical explorations of Eastern philosophy."

The long windows of the hall sent the morning light into his eyes. He shaded them to look out at the students packed into the tiers of seats, rising away from him, as their attention did the longer he spoke. He caught Stewart's glare from near the top of the hall, unable to tell if it was one of anger, disappointment or resignation. Turning to the whiteboard, he wrote 'TAT TVAM ASI' in quick, squeaky strokes.

Keystrokes and pen scribbles sounded out as the students added the phrase to their notes. Silas tapped each of the three words in succession. "That. Thou. Art." Even with his voice raised and the keyboards clicking once more, he could clearly make out another conversation erupting among some students.

Silas shielded his eyes from the sunlight again as he peered out to see the commotion. "Is he ok?" "Does he seem ok?" "He needs help." "Professor?" Above it all, a single phrase repeated and grew in volume. "I am not that!" Stewart was standing, removing his t-shirt, having already tossed his sweatshirt at the row of students in front of him.

Without thinking, a look of concern and empathy stealing over his face, Silas instructed his teaching assistant to call for Miss Azami and ran up the stairs. Halfway up, a flash of heat—unreasonable, sourceless—washed across his face, carrying with it the smell of something burning. Sandalwood, perhaps. Or flesh. The sensation passed before he could name it. Stewart's fellow students had already cleared the surrounding seats, but having done so put themselves in the path to him. Turning to the side and putting his hand out before him, Silas cleared a path as he watched Stewart kick off the last leg of his jeans.

"Stewart, look at me." Silas reached the aisle, students around him breathing a sigh of relief as it became apparent Stewart would not remove his underwear next. "Stewart, look at me."

"I am not that!" The skinny kid in his boxers was screaming, arms wide and gaze focused on the whiteboard. Silas inched closer to Stewart, trying to get his attention, occasionally turning to shake his head at the snickering students, trying unsuccessfully to get them to stop from laughing out loud.

"Class dismissed. Read Chapter 6 of the Chandogya Upanishad for next time." Silas noticed a small cheer as he motioned the students to leave and sat down a few chairs from where Stewart was still screaming.

"I am not that!" Again and again Stewart insisted, his voice lowering from a scream to a soft insistent chant. Silas remained almost impossibly calm, eyes remaining forward, not turning to look at the near naked teenager, letting him run out of steam on his own. Noticing Lilith come into the hall followed by a campus security officer, Silas clapped three times, sharply, loudly.

Stewart turned, one last "I am not that" escaping in a whisper as he collapsed into his seat. Silas nodded and smiled knowingly, almost lovingly, not losing eye contact with the distressed student. Lilith approached from the other side, slowly.

"Stewart? Stewart Sheldon?" Lilith drew his attention to her, leaving Silas breathing a sigh of relief as he stood and walked back toward the stairs, beckoning the security officer to approach him rather than Stewart and Lilith. The security guard's shoulders dropped, releasing tension upon noting that Silas had complete faith in Lilith's ability to handle the situation.

Lilith sat down next to Stewart, handing him the jeans and t-shirt she had collected on her way over to him. She spoke in a calm, reassuring tone, one she recognized now as she used it to diffuse the situation and assess the student. It was the tone Silas often achieved in conversations with her. She turned her attention down to where Silas and the security officer were quietly discussing what had happened during the class.

Silas noticed her looking at him, remembering how she had seen his interaction with Stewart earlier that morning. He turned again to the whiteboard and Lilith noticed something click in him as he shook his head and muttered Stewart's insight. "I am not that." A wave of release washed over Silas. A weight he didn't know he had been carrying suddenly vanished, a profound peace almost lifting him from the ground.

The look and words sent a visible shudder through Lilith as she walked Stewart toward the door while he clumsily put his clothes back on. She looked up at Silas as if in frustration at not having been able to delay the breakthrough. Despair mixed with respect for his unwavering spirit. Silas stared back, apparently lost in his transformation, the realization that he possessed no thou that could be that.

The security officer collected the backpack and sweatshirt Stewart had left behind and couldn't help but notice the intense moment Silas and Lilith shared from across the hall.


It was a moment that neither had forgotten when they bumped into each other in the empty academic hallway a little while later. The afternoon shadows played through the stained glass windows as they met. Dark wood paneling covered the wall behind the bench where they turned to sit. Lilith drew close to Silas, placing her hand on his knee.

"How's Stewart?" She could hear the genuine concern in his voice.

"Broken." Silas nodded and turned from her. "You handled the situation well, Silas. How are you doing?"

"Lilith…" His words didn't seem to come. She patted his knee as he looked back to her.

"I'll make you an appointment with Ellen." Lilith leaned in toward him, an easy empathy almost contrived. "You should talk through the experience. You seem shaken."

Silas shook his head, his glasses sliding down his nose. "That's just it. I'm not shaken Lilith." She pulled back a bit as he pushed his glasses back up, smiling. "I think Stewart showed me a truth. A glimpse of what I've been teaching about, or the absence beneath it."

Her eyes could have been mistaken as betraying sadness, when it was actually worry they tried to hide. "You know this is where I caution you not to mistake an emotional response to a traumatic event with genuine spiritual insight."

The soft laugh that escaped him took them both by surprise. Lilith stood, as if her attempts at intimacy through proximity had proved fruitless. "Ellen will just tell me to journal about it, meditate on it, maybe take some time off."

"She's a professional Silas, as are you." Lilith was growing short with him, taking a step back, looking past him down the hallway as if wishing someone would come along to intrude on their private moment. "She wouldn't be wrong."

He stood up himself, clearing his throat, his own look of resolve mirroring the one Lilith had shown that morning during his confrontation with Stewart. "No, she wouldn't."

Lilith straightened her jacket, then reached out to the tweed that Silas wore, running her hands down his chest as if attempting to press out the ever-present wrinkles. Her attempt at closeness fell flat though, Silas placing his own hands on her shoulders, looking into her eyes. "I'll take a meeting with Ellen later this week. Now I have to prepare for our faculty meeting this afternoon."

He was too confident, and they both knew it. Lilith nodded and turned around, lost in her growing concern over his spiritual progress as he walked slowly behind her, lost in his dreams of continuing it. The buzz of the air conditioner fought the rare afternoon heat in Manchester, attempting to cool too much space with too little cold air.


The heat was unabated that afternoon in the committee room, the University never having retrofitted the building it was in with air conditioning. Faculty shuffled into the formal space, dragging heavy wooden chairs over the carpeting to make space at the giant oak conference table that dominated the room. The Dean nodded as Silas and Lilith entered the room. "Great job with Mr. Sheldon this morning, you two. From what I gather, your teamwork averted what could have been quite the crisis."

"Thank you, sir." Silas beamed with what may have been mistaken for pride if the faculty weren't so aware of his boundless humility. He smiled at Lilith with a warm confidence, meaning to share in the praise with her, but she frowned.

"It remains a crisis for young Stewart." Pulling her chair in, Lilith scanned the faces in the room, confident and comfortable in what was usually a tense meeting. "He is doing well, though, and we will transfer him to North Manchester General for observation tomorrow morning."

"Yes, well." Flustered in a way they all knew only Lilith could illicit, the Dean took his own seat and shuffled the papers awaiting him. "We have much to get through this afternoon, we might as well get right to it."

As the group worked through the agenda it became increasingly difficult for the participants to discern if the light around Silas was the afternoon sun hitting him through the blinds or something radiating from within him. Lilith seemed particularly perplexed, paying more attention to his mannerisms than she was to the discussion around her. A look of focused concern set itself on her face, so stern that even Silas took notice. The moment was lost to a general groan from the room as the Dean moved on to the next agenda item.

"Ongoing issues with our course evaluation system." Low student responsiveness, outdated and biased questions, overweighted in tenure decisions, everyone had a comment. Quiet until then, it was Silas that offered an oddly intuitive and sensible suggestion.

"How about we implement a mid-semester feedback system?" His fingers tapped on the table, as if drawing inspiration not from the dead wood it was now but the living tree it had once been. "It would allow us to make real time adjustments, show responsiveness to student input, maybe even increase interest in the final evaluation."

As with any good idea the faculty debated, tossed it around the room, studying every aspect, leaving no facet unscrutinized. Silas watched on in earnest, full of energy, illuminating dark aspects, softening sharp edges. The Dean noticed Lilith growing impatient, not with the discussion, but with the path Silas seemed to be on. He was driven, sure of himself, ready to take the next step she couldn't allow him to take.

"What are your thoughts, Miss Azari?" The Dean's question quited the room, refocusing the attention from Silas towards Lilith. She folded her hands in front of her, not looking toward Silas, but scanning the room as if her thoughts lay somewhere in the intricate details of the portraits that lined the far wall. Settling her attention on the Dean, her shoulders relaxed, at first appearing to be a sign of resignation.

"The faculty already carries an excessive workload." The resignation was quickly recognized for what it was, the firm assurance that she was right. Lilith let her gaze move around the room to each of the faculty, except for Silas. "The students will take the entire evaluation process less seriously if we are constantly asking them how we are doing." She took the idea that had been growing under his nurturing energy and all but crushed it, sending its once promising fragments drifting into the aether.

What followed was like an intellectual fencing match. The rest of the staff became fixated as Silas and Lilith sparred over the idea, at first reforming, then again smashing the concept. Their debate over whether the students had the ability to assess progress or if any assessment was in the end misguided and of little use had both of them almost rising out of their seats. Even the Dean looked on as if he wasn't witnessing a disagreement over course evaluations but a primordial battle between trust and doubt personified.

Lilith finally rested back into her seat and wiped away a bead of sweat that had formed on her brow. "Meaningful evaluation of what they are taught will always be tempered by uncertainty over the effectiveness, authenticity and value of the teaching."

Silas, ready to offer another rebuttal, squinted his eyes as if realizing Lilith wasn't just casting doubt on his suggestion, but on something deeper. His face eased into a smile, betraying he had no uncertainty regarding the teaching. "You have the experience and understanding." His fingers ceased tapping as he nodded deferentially to her and mouthed the words of his mantra, I am boundless awareness. Somewhere distant—beyond the room, beyond the building, beyond anywhere that made sense—a child cried. High, thin, wrong in a way he couldn't identify. He glanced at the window. Nothing. The sound had already faded, leaving only the afternoon light and the uncomfortable certainty that he had heard it clearly.

"There's plenty of experience and understanding around this table, Mr. Phalavan." A nervous chuckle followed the Dean's statement, as if attempting to cut some tension hanging in the air. The afternoon sun had sunk, casting new shadows across the room. The light still hung about Silas though, a darker hue perhaps, but still illuminating. Silas looked away from Lilith, but not before she caught a look of insight steal across his face. She couldn't help by notice he continued to silently recite his mantra to himself as the issue of course evaluations was tabled and the meeting concluded.


Silas was reciting his affirmation, currently aloud, when he bumped into Lilith later that evening, walking through University Green. They were the only two around in the twilight as dark clouds obscured the sunset, threatening rain.

"Quite the show at the meeting today." Stopping in front of him Lilith waved her hand, dismissing his statement. He persisted. "I didn't know you were so passionate about student evaluations."

She shook her head and smiled. The street lights flickered to life, the darkness encroaching enough to trigger their sensors. "Look at you Silas, so sure of yourself." Motioning to a bench she walked to it and sat, looking up at him, concern wiping away the smile which had been so disarming mere moments before.

Silas did not sit, but followed and stood over her, taking the opportunity to shake his own head. He shone under the fluorescent lamp, distant thunder drawing their attention as it pealed over the horizon. "Storm coming." Lilith nodded in agreement and patted the seat next to her on the bench. Finally sitting Silas exhaled a bit too loudly, releasing some tension that remained in him.

"What is it Lilith? Something not fitting the patterns of all those past lives you've seen?" The chuckle that followed failed to convince Lilith he was simply trying to lighten the mood, which indeed he was not. Her brow furrowed even more.

"Did you book a time with Ellen?" Her hand reached out to place itself on his hands, themselves folded on his lap, but they pulled away, leaving hers brushing his leg and withdrawing. "I care about you, Silas. Perhaps too much."

The words of his affirmation almost formed on his lips as he turned away and sighed. A small wind picked up as the air moistened, bringing the slightly sweet smell of impending precipitation. "I know Lilith, but as I said this afternoon, you have nothing to worry about." Her hand, more persistent this time, gently tugged his chin, turning his face back toward her.

"You said Stewart showed you something. What did he show you, Silas?"

For a moment, Silas couldn't breathe. Stone dust coated his tongue—impossible, imagined—and the weight of a narrow space pressed against his shoulders. A cell. A tomb. Somewhere he had been confined willingly, waiting for something that never came. The sensation lifted as quickly as it arrived.

She looked at him, eyes widening in what would have been mistaken for anticipation by someone less perceptive. Instead, when combined with her tight lips and stiffened posture, it betrayed fear.

A woman opened her umbrella as she walked by, the clicking and whooshing sound drawing Silas and Lilith's attention for a moment. They both shifted on the bench to watch before focusing on one another again.

"Oddly enough, you may be the only person I know who might understand." Silas took a deep breath before continuing. "It was more the situation than Stewart, poor kid. Lilith, I realized I am not that, and I am also not 'not that'." He shook his head and laughed. The uneasy mirth his seemingly nonsensical statement brought about in him shifted as he noticed Lilith nodding in complete understanding.

"No Silas, you are not." Her eyes looked down and away as a brief frown seemed to deflate her usually confident manner. She was thinking, eyes looking first this way then that, the muscles in her striking face tensing, releasing. "You haven't been for a very long time."

"For many lifetimes?" His quip was a half-hearted attempt to return to the levity of their usual banter. It was ineffective. Lilith looked about, noticing the appearance of a few raindrops here and there, hitting the bench, the walkway.

"I have a new practice for you, to complement your mantra." The smile was back, her eyes bright in the way they were when they had first met. A single drop of rain from the sky hit her cheek, glistening as it rolled down. "It's a mindfulness technique. Nothing religious, but hard to master."

Silas wiped a raindrop from her cheek as a few more fell around them. Thunder clapped, much closer. He stood, looking up into the sky with wonder. "I am boundless awareness."

"That you are." She stood next to him, placing her hands on in shoulders, looking through the drops into his eyes. "This practice will bound that awareness." Lilith tapped his chest, pointing at his heart. "A new habit to overcome the habitual."


Silas tried Lilith's practice when they returned to her apartment, while she insisted on drying her hair. His affirmation continued to run in his mind, as if given new depth since his recent revelations. The noise of the hair dryer permeated the room despite the torrential downfall and occasional rumble of thunder outside.

Watching him as she finished up, Lilith sat in a chair across from him. The slight smell of wet hair lingered. His posture was impeccable, his concentration complete. The moment seemed to stretch as she closed her eyes and appeared to slip into a practice of her own. The lights in the room became impossibly bright, yet neither of them noticed.

They sat like that a while, calm, serene, deep in their practice. Two beings breathing, across from each other in physical space, entangled in spirit. The very air charged with an energy which swirled about them, both inside and out. He looked deep into her eyes, entranced as he often had been by their limitlessness.

The apprehension in her eyes wasn't apparent. To Silas it was an expectant look, as if she was wondering if the meditation technique was working. His affirmation slipped as something else betrayed itself in her gaze.

He shuddered as he recognized those eyes, in another place. Another rainy night, a different city, a passerby. Lilith, but not Lilith, rushing to avoid an antique car. The car was a brand new Buick Roadmaster. "Not antique." He verbalized the thought as Lilith shook her head, agreeing that it was not. Their conversation from that morning came back to him.

"….how many times I died cold and alone." Something more powerful than his mantra took hold of him as he uttered the phrase. He noticed his fingers numb as if from frostbite, the taste of blood in his mouth, a whisper in a foreign language he somehow understood. Impressions one after the other, so real.

They were real. They were his experiences, lived in other times, other lives. He focused on Lilith again, she knew. "You have seen them."

Her shoulders relaxed. After a pause she replied. "I have." She stood up immediately and turned away from him. "You're still adjusting. The meditation was deep. Let's focus on that. Your breath, your body, your surroundings."

The room came back into full focus as Silas found his breath. "I am boundless…" He couldn't finish.

Lilith was walking toward the other room when her phone rang. A loud peel of thunder interrupted the beginning of the conversation. Silas looked outside at the pouring rain, his head suddenly clear again. Lilith picked up her coat. "I'll be right there."


The rain had turned torrential by the time they reached the car, each drop shattering against the pavement like tiny failures of the sky to contain itself. Lilith's key fob chirped twice before the locks released, and she was already sliding behind the wheel when Silas pulled the passenger door open, his clothes heavy with water that had found every seam and gap.

"Stewart checked himself out." She turned the ignition, the engine catching on the second try. "A security guard spotted him entering the Henry Royce Institute twenty minutes ago."

The wipers began their metronomic protest against the deluge, barely keeping pace with what the storm delivered. Lilith pulled into traffic, her knuckles pale against the steering wheel, illuminated by the amber wash of passing streetlights.

"They called you?" The question came out slower than Silas intended, as though his voice had to travel through something thicker than air.

"I was his evaluating clinician." She took the corner harder than necessary, the tires hydroplaning for a moment that stretched longer than physics should have allowed. "The administration wants me present when they talk him down. If he can be talked down."

The dashboard glow caught the planes of her face, and Silas saw something there he hadn't noticed in all their months together—a tightness around her eyes that had nothing to do with the rain or the road. Her jaw worked silently, as if chewing words she hadn't yet decided to swallow or speak.

"Focus on your breath." Her voice had shifted to that clinical register, the one she used when she was helping, or pretending to. "Your affirmation. Stewart needs you present, not scattered through memories that don't belong to this life."

The practice. The one she'd taught him hours ago, lifetimes ago, moments ago. Silas closed his eyes and tried to find the breath she'd mapped for him, the pattern of inhalation and pause and release that was supposed to bind his scattered awareness into something useful. But the flashbacks surged against the technique like water against those futile wipers—a face in a crowd that was her face but younger somehow, a language he didn't speak but understood, the taste of blood that had nothing to do with the rain.

"I can't hold it." He opened his eyes, and the street outside seemed to pulse with significance he couldn't decode. "The practice. It feels—" Empty. Hollow. A ritual performed without belief. But those were her words, her technique, and saying them felt like accusation.

Lightning split the sky ahead, and in its brief illumination, he saw her grip tighten further on the wheel. Thunder followed, close enough to shake the car's windows in their frames.

"Lilith." Her name came out different than he intended, weighted with a question he hadn't formulated.

"I didn't find you by accident, Silas."

The words hung between them, suspended in the space the wipers couldn't clear. She hadn't looked at him when she said it—her eyes remained fixed on the road, on the rain, on anything but his face.

"What does that mean?"

A delivery truck passed in the opposite lane, its wake adding to the water sheeting across the windshield. For three heartbeats, they were driving blind.

"It means exactly what it sounds like." Her voice cracked on the final word, a fissure in the clinical precision she'd maintained since the phone call. "I've been watching you for a very long time. Longer than you know. Longer than you can know."

The University appeared through the storm, its buildings dark except for the Henry Royce Institute, which glowed from its upper floors like a signal fire. The tallest academic structure on campus, Silas had never been inside. Had never thought about how high it reached until now.

Lilith pulled into the first available space, killing the engine but not moving to exit. The rain hammered against metal and glass, and without the wipers' effort, the world outside dissolved into an impressionist blur of light and water.

"Everything I've taught you." She still wouldn't look at him. "The practices. The awareness exercises. The meditation technique tonight." Her hands had released the steering wheel but remained before her, fingers slightly curled, as if holding something invisible. "They weren't meant to free you."

The thunder rolled again, more distant now, retreating. In its wake, her breathing was audible—ragged and uneven.

"They were meant to keep you here. With me. I couldn't let you—" She stopped, jaw clenching, whatever words came next trapped behind her teeth.

Silas found he couldn't speak. The revelations from her apartment were nothing compared to this—that had been abstract, other lives bleeding through, faces in time. This was concrete. This was the woman beside him admitting to a calculation that extended back before their first meeting, before the first time she'd smiled at him across a faculty reception, before every touch and conversation and offered technique.

"Couldn't let me what?" His voice emerged hoarse, unfamiliar.

Lilith finally turned to face him. Lightning flashed again, and in its pale strobe, he saw vulnerability where control had always lived—her eyes reflecting not the composed psychiatrist but something older and more wounded than he had imagined possible.

"Couldn't let you go somewhere I can't follow."

The admission cost her something. He could see it in the way her shoulders drew inward, in the slight tremor at the corner of her mouth. This wasn't confession as strategy. This was pressure finding a crack.

"We need to move." She pulled her coat tighter and opened the door into the storm's assault. "Stewart is up there. Whatever else is happening, that hasn't changed."

They ran through water that reached their ankles in places, the campus pathways turned to shallow rivers by a drainage system never designed for this volume. The Henry Royce Institute loomed ahead, its lit windows watching their approach like eyes.

"You're not the only one who's close." Lilith was shouting over the rain now, her words arriving in fragments between thunderclaps. "And I can't—I can't—"

She stopped. They both stopped, standing in the downpour at the building's entrance, water streaming down their faces. Her jaw tightened against whatever words came next, and Silas understood she was wrestling something back behind the professional mask.

"Can't what, Lilith?"

But she was already pulling open the door, already moving toward whatever waited above. He followed, as he had been following her guidance for months, though now every step felt different—not toward enlightenment but away from some truth she'd nearly told him.

The building's interior offered silence after the storm's assault. Emergency lighting cast long shadows down empty corridors, and somewhere overhead, a young man stood at the edge of something none of them could name.

Lilith's wet clothes dripped onto the linoleum as she paused at the stairwell door. "The confession can wait. Stewart can't."

She was right, of course. Even now, even with everything fractured between them, she was right about this. A student in crisis took precedence over whatever game they'd been playing without Silas knowing the rules.

He pushed past her and began to climb, his footsteps echoing in the narrow stairwell like a heartbeat amplified beyond bearing. Behind him, he heard her follow, and the persistence in that rhythm—her steps always slightly behind his, matching his pace, tracking his ascent—carried a weight it hadn't before.

The rooftop access door waited at the top, marked with warnings about alarm systems and authorized personnel. Silas pressed his palm against the metal, feeling its chill even through the numbness the rain had left behind.

"Silas." Lilith's hand closed around his wrist. "Whatever happens up there—whatever I've done—I didn't want this. I didn't want it for him, and I didn't want it for you."

He looked at her in the harsh fluorescent light, this woman he'd trusted with techniques meant to bind rather than free, with practices designed to keep him close rather than help him grow. The fury he expected to feel wasn't there. Only a vast confusion, and beneath it, something stranger—the sense that her manipulation and his progress had never been truly separable.

"I know," he said, though he didn't know, couldn't know, might never know.

He opened the door.

The wind hit first, cooler than the rain had been, carrying the last gasps of the storm that had already begun to move east. The rooftop stretched before them, populated by exhaust vents and HVAC units and the low barrier wall that separated the building from the empty air beyond.

Near that barrier, a silhouette stood against the lights of the city below.


Stewart turned at the sound of the door, and in the city's ambient glow, Silas could see he wasn't the same young man who'd stripped in the lecture hall that morning. The desperation was gone. In its place, something worse—a terrible clarity that settled across his features like frost.

"Professor Phalavan." The words carried no surprise, no distress. An observation, nothing more. "I thought they might send you."

The rain had gentled to a mist that hung in the air rather than fell through it, catching the light from below and turning the rooftop into something between worlds. Silas took a step forward, and the cold hit him—wrong cold, old cold, a chill that had nothing to do with the Manchester night or the mist rising from the streets below. It settled in his bones as if it had always been there, waiting to be remembered. He felt Lilith close behind him but did not look back.

"Stewart." He kept his voice even, the professional calm that had served him in the lecture hall. "Let's talk about what's happening."

"What's happening?" Stewart's laugh was soft, almost wondering. He stood perhaps fifteen feet from the barrier, his hospital bracelet still visible on his wrist, his clothes soaked through. "Nothing's happening, Professor. That's the whole point. Nothing has ever been happening. I finally understand that."

Another step. Silas could feel the training activating—crisis intervention, the careful approach, the measured tone. But beneath the technique, something else stirred. The flashbacks pulsed at the edges of his vision, threatening to pull him out of this moment and into others that belonged to lifetimes he couldn't remember living.

"You left the hospital." State the obvious. Ground the conversation in facts. "People are worried about you."

"People." Stewart turned slightly, not toward Silas but toward the city spread below—the lights of Manchester arranged in patterns that meant nothing, signified nothing. "People are worried about the person they think I am. But that person doesn't exist. You taught me that this morning, Professor."

The words landed with more force than Stewart could have intended. Silas felt them settle in his chest, next to the hollow space where his mantra used to live.

"I taught you philosophy, Stewart. Ideas to consider. Not conclusions to act on."

"Didn't you?" Now Stewart did turn, and his eyes caught the reflected light from below. "What you wrote on the board. What you taught us. A structure in me—" He pressed his hand against his sternum, a gesture Silas recognized because he'd made it himself, in the lecture hall, in the committee room, in Lilith's apartment. "A structure I thought was solid. It cracked. Or maybe it finally stopped pretending to be whole."

Lilith shifted behind him, and Silas heard her breath catch. She should be stepping forward now. She was the clinician. This was her domain. But she remained where she was, frozen at the edge of his peripheral vision.

"What broke, Stewart?"

"The lie." He said it simply, without drama. "I am not my grades. I figured that out first, and it was almost a relief. I am not my parents' expectations. That took longer to accept. I am not my future, because what future? I am not even my thoughts, because who's watching the thoughts if there's no one here to watch?"

The mist was thinning now, the storm exhausting itself against the city. Somewhere below, a siren wailed and faded.

"So I kept going." Stewart's voice remained conversational, as if they were discussing chapter six in a seminar room. "If I'm not that, and I'm not that, and I'm not that—what's left? What's the thing underneath all the things I'm not?"

Silas knew the answer. Had taught the answer. Had believed the answer for years before this morning, when Stewart's screaming had cracked something open that couldn't be sealed again.

"Nothing." Stewart smiled, and the smile was worse than the words. "Nothing's left. Just awareness aware of itself being aware, which sounds profound until you realize it's just another way of saying there's no one home. Never was. The whole show—" He gestured at the city, at the sky, at himself. "—performed for an audience that doesn't exist."

"That's not—" Silas started, but the rebuttal died before it formed. Because how could he argue? He'd felt the same dissolution in the lecture hall, the same groundless ground opening beneath his sense of self. The difference was that for him, the opening had felt like release. For Stewart, it felt like annihilation.

"You seemed so at peace with it." Stewart's voice softened, genuine curiosity replacing the terrible calm. "In the lecture. When you looked at what I'd written on myself by accident. You smiled, Professor. Like you'd found something wonderful. How do you accept being nothing and still want to stay?"

The question struck home. Silas searched for an answer—in his training, in his philosophy, in the practices that had suddenly revealed themselves as prisons rather than paths—and found only silence.

He'd spent his career teaching people to question the self, to loosen their grip on identity, to see through the illusion of a permanent, unchanging I. But he'd never considered what happened when someone saw through it too fast, without the foundation of something to stand on while the old floor fell away.

"I don't know," he said. The honesty surprised him. "Stewart, I don't know how to answer that."

Stewart nodded, as if this were the response he'd expected. "She told me I was having a break from reality." He looked past Silas to where Lilith stood motionless. "That what I understood wasn't understanding at all. Just neurons misfiring. Chemistry gone wrong."

Silas turned, finally, to look at her. Lilith's face held an expression he'd never seen—not the clinical mask, not the calculating concern, but something rawer. Her hands were clenched at her sides, and in the city light, he could see fine tremors running through her shoulders.

"Was she right, Professor?"

He turned back to Stewart, the question hanging between them like the mist that still clung to the air. The young man who'd stripped naked and screamed in a lecture hall stood at the edge of a building, asking if his insight was illness or awakening, and Silas—who had spent the day having the same insight without the same terror—found he couldn't answer.

"I don't think it's that simple." The words came slowly, feeling their way through a darkness he couldn't map. "What you saw this morning—what I saw—it's not wrong. But it's not complete either."

"Complete." Stewart tasted the word. "What's missing, then? What comes after you realize there's nothing here?"

Behind him, Silas heard a small sound from Lilith—a catch of breath that might have been a sob if she'd allowed it to complete. He didn't turn. Couldn't turn. Something was happening in his chest, a loosening he recognized from the lecture hall but deeper now, more dangerous.

The helper identity. The compulsion to be the one who saves, who fixes, who guides others through their darkness. He'd carried it so long he'd forgotten it was separate from him—but it wasn't him, was it? It was just another costume, another role, another thing he was not.

And here it was, fully activated, straining toward Stewart with every technique and reassurance it had accumulated over decades. The urge to close the distance, to offer the right words, to be the professor who talked the student down from the ledge.

But the urge itself was the problem. He could feel it now like a harness around his chest, pulling him forward—could see it as clearly as Stewart's silhouette against the lights below. The need to help was attachment. The identity of helper was still identity, still self, still the illusion that kept him bound to the wheel. To step out of it now would be to truly let go. It would be the final surrender. And it would mean leaving Stewart utterly alone.

Stewart had seen through himself and found nothing. Silas had seen through himself and found something else—but what? What remained when even the desire to save was recognized as another mask?

"Professor?" Stewart's voice cut through his dissolution. "You went somewhere just now."

"I'm here." But was he? The boundaries felt uncertain—between himself and Stewart, between Stewart and the city lights, between this moment and all the other moments his flashbacks had shown him through the evening. Lilith's face across time. Blood in his mouth from lives he couldn't remember. The sensation of dissolution without the terror, falling without a floor but somehow not falling.

The storm had broken. The rain had stopped. The mist remained, but lighter now, and through it, Silas could see Stewart more clearly than before. The young man's hand rested on the barrier wall—not gripping, just touching, as if testing its reality.

"There's something I haven't told you." Stewart's voice had changed, the terrible calm giving way to something almost tender. "When I was screaming in the lecture hall, when everyone was staring and you were walking toward me—I could feel you. Not just see you. Feel you. Like we were the same thing, looking at itself from two directions."

Silas's breath stopped.

"That's when I knew you understood. That's when I knew it wasn't just me losing my mind. We're not separate, Professor. We never were. The boundaries are just another part of the lie."

The words echoed a thought Silas had turned over in Lilith's apartment, the notion that the barrier between self and other was already blurring. He'd assumed it was metaphor, philosophy made experiential. But Stewart was saying it literally, as a lived fact.

"The problem is," Stewart continued, and his hand moved slightly on the barrier wall, "if we're not separate, then nothing I do matters to anyone else, because there isn't anyone else. And nothing anyone else does matters to me, because there isn't a me." He looked down at the city. "So why stay? Why keep pretending there's someone here who needs to keep breathing?"

Lilith made another sound behind him. Sharper this time, almost a gasp. Silas heard her take a step forward, then stop. When he glanced back, he saw something cross her face he couldn't read: not the concern of a clinician, not the calculation of whatever game she'd been playing. Something more like recognition. The horror of seeing her own fear of emptiness mirrored in this boy, the consequence of techniques meant to constrain rather than liberate. Something more like loss.

She should be acting. This was her patient, her responsibility, her professional domain. But she stood frozen, arms half-raised as if to reach for someone who wasn't there.

The thunder was distant now, a retreating complaint from a storm that had spent its fury. In the silence it left behind, Stewart turned back toward the barrier.

"You were right, Professor."

Silas took a step forward, and the step felt different from the ones that had come before—no longer the helper rushing to save, no longer the professional managing a crisis, but a presence stripped of role and purpose moving toward another presence equally stripped.

"Stewart—"

"Tat tvam asi." Stewart's hand left the barrier. He turned toward Silas—toward connection, it seemed, toward the recognition of their shared unreality. "That thou—"

But the turn carried him. His foot found the barrier's base, and what had been a pivot became a stumble, and what had been a stumble became gravity taking hold of what balance had released.

Silas lunged.

The distance between them collapsed—fifteen feet, ten, five—and time stretched in the way time stretches only at the threshold of irreversible things. Stewart's body was past the barrier now, the city lights reflecting in his eyes, his hand reaching back toward the rooftop, toward Silas, toward the connection he'd been trying to articulate.

And then something else—

Snow. Silas saw snow, felt snow, was buried in it. Wind screamed through a silence so complete it stopped being sound. His fingers blackened and numb, meat freezing on bones that had already stopped belonging to him. Hunger—not for food but for something he'd failed to learn, a lesson that required other hands, other warmth, bodies he'd pushed away. The world going white. Muscles failing. The desperate knowledge of something dying alone because it had chosen alone, had hoarded alone, had believed alone was strength until the storm proved otherwise.

He staggered. Caught himself on the barrier. The vision—memory?—passed, leaving only the rooftop, the city lights, Stewart's reaching hand.

Silas didn't understand it. But it had been real.

His own hand extended, the helper identity's final act or something beyond it—the boundary between self and other already blurring, already meaningless, already collapsed into a single gesture that was both reaching and being reached for.

The mist caught the light from below. Stewart's fingers spread wide, pale against the darkness. Silas felt the edge of the barrier press against his hip as he leaned over, farther than balance should allow, farther than sense would permit.

Their fingers touched, or didn't, and the rain had stopped.
