The tree.

Larger than it had seemed from the village—the trunk so wide that four people holding hands could not have circled it, the bark furrowed and gray with age, with weather, with centuries of standing in one place while everything around it changed. The roots surfaced and dove like the coils of vast movement just beneath the earth, creating hollows and rises in the ground that shaped where bodies naturally settled.

The branches spread outward in a canopy that filtered the morning light into shifting patterns—dappled shade, alive with motion, the leaves moving in a wind too gentle to feel on the skin. The smell of green growth, of bark and soil and sweetness of sap running beneath surfaces. The sound of leaves touching leaves, a whisper without words.

Old. Older than anyone remembered. The villagers had no stories about when it was planted or who had planted it—it had simply always been, the way the hills had always been, the way the spring had always flowed. Where people came when they needed to think. When decisions grew too heavy for ordinary ground.

The body settled against the trunk. Bark pressed into the back through fabric—rough, specific, insisting on its presence. The ground cupped the seated form in one of the hollows shaped by rising roots, as if the tree had grown to accommodate the sitting of bodies, had shaped itself around the human habit of seeking shelter beneath its branches.

Light filtered. Leaves moved. Somewhere in the distance, a child's voice rose and fell in the shape of a game.

Time became optional.

Simpler than meditation, more complete. No meditator, no practice pursued, no goal sought. The body sat. The breathing continued. Awareness rested on what arose without reaching for or pushing away.

The remaining fetters were visible now—as textures in experience rather than concepts, as places where attention still caught on itself. The last handholds on the cliff face before the opening into open sky.

*Desire for form realms.*

The beauty of this place. The healed earth, the clean air, the faces without the tension of want. The village and its rhythms, the children and their laughter, the bread and the water and the morning light slanting through leaves. All of it beautiful. All of it good. And all of it—still the wheel.

The recognition came quietly, without drama. Even paradise was conditioned. Even this post-scarcity world, this future that previous lives could only have dreamed of—it arose from causes, it would pass from effects, it was still becoming rather than being. The wheel continued turning. The forms changed, from suffering to ease, from scarcity to abundance, from violence to peace. But form was form, conditioned was conditioned, and attachment to any form—even beautiful forms—was still attachment.

But—and here the recognition deepened—seeing this didn't require escaping it. The wheel visible wasn't the wheel escaped. It was the wheel understood. Nothing needed to change in the village, in the morning, in the light through leaves. Only the relationship to it shifted—from grasping to seeing, from needing to recognizing.

The fetter thinned. There was no one to break it, no effort that could shatter what was already transparent. It simply became visible, and in becoming visible, lost its power to bind.

---

*Desire for formless realms.*

Memory surfaced—the gentle recall of what had so recently passed. The formless realms of the previous passage. Infinite space, expanding past every boundary. Infinite consciousness, the "I" dissolved into the ocean of knowing. Nothingness itself, the subtlest rest before the final threshold. And the neither-perception-nor-non-perception that had been the finest dwelling, the last station before what waited beyond.

The bliss of it. The relief of releasing the weight of body, the constraint of form, the limitation of being somewhere rather than everywhere. The intertwining that had been two consciousnesses merging beyond edges. It had been good. It had been true. And it had been—still attachment.

The formless realms were also meat. Subtle meat rather than gross, refined clinging rather than crude grasping, but clinging still. The desire to return there, to dwell forever in the spaciousness that form denied—it was another form of wanting things to be other than they were. Another way of saying: this, here, now—insufficient. Another way of fleeing what was toward what was preferred.

The memory released its grip. Through the same clear seeing that had thinned the previous fetter rather than through effort. The formless realms were part of the journey, but they were passage rather than destination. They were rest stops on a wheel that kept turning, and attachment to the rest stops was still attachment to the wheel.

The fetter thinned. Became visible. Lost its power.

*Conceit.*

The subtlest of the remaining fetters, the most difficult to see because it wore the clothing of humility. The gross pride of achievement had burned away long before, in lives that had learned through failure after failure that accomplishment was never owned. This was finer. The conceit of being-about-to-complete.

The "I" that remained when all other "I"s had dissolved. The one who was almost there. The one who had passed through the fetters, the realms, the dissolutions, and now sat beneath a tree on the edge of becoming what had been become for ages of the world.

It was still identity. Still self-construction. Still the assembling of a someone who could be about-to-complete, who would be the one completing, whose completion would be an achievement however much the language denied achievement.

When there's no one completing, completion happens without an achiever.

The phrase arose from nowhere—seeing occurring rather than teaching remembered. The conceit saw itself seeing, and in the seeing, could maintain itself. There was no one beneath the tree about to awaken. There was sitting happening. There was the process continuing. But the "one" who had seemed to be the one doing it—

Visible now. Like a line drawn on glass, only apparent when the light caught it at certain angles. The line had never been a barrier. It had been a drawing of a barrier, a representation with no substance.

The fetter revealed itself as having never been substantial, and the recognition was the dissolving.

---

*Restlessness.*

The vibration of almost-there-ness. The subtle agitation that kept attention always leaning forward, always seeking the next moment, the completion, the end. Even in stillness, the restlessness had hummed—readiness for motion rather than motion itself. The coiled spring that kept experience tense with anticipation.

It was activity without action. Movement without motion. The continuous preparation for a future that receded as it approached, always a moment away, never quite now.

But there was nowhere to get. There was no completion to arrive at that was elsewhere when already here, already this, already the sitting and the breathing and the light through leaves. The restlessness had been running toward a destination that could be elsewhere, because location itself was part of the wheel, and the wheel was all there was.

The running stopped. Unnecessary rather than suppressed. When there's nowhere to get, there's no need to keep moving toward it. The spring uncoiled. The vibration stilled. Into presence rather than deadness. Into the fullness of this moment, which contained everything that restlessness had been seeking in future moments.

---

*Ignorance.*

The root. The ground beneath all the other fetters, the soil from which they had grown. The fundamental not-seeing that had made possible every construction of self, every grasping and aversion, every turning of the wheel.

What was ignorance? Information had been abundant across hundreds of lives, thousands of teachers, millions of words pointing toward what was already present. The ignorance was simpler and more total: the looking-away that preceded all looking-toward. The unconscious assumption that there was discovery to be made elsewhere, that what was here was insufficient, that the seeking itself pointed toward a found that would complete the seeker.

But the seeking had always found only more seeking. And the seeker who sought had always been the seeking wearing a mask of separateness, pretending to be other than the motion it performed.

The ignorance saw itself.

And in seeing itself—this was the strangest thing—it revealed itself as having never been substantial. Neither overcome nor conquered, neither present then and gone now. Rather: never there at all. A darkness that was the absence of looking rather than true darkness. A blindness that was the habit of looking away rather than true blindness.

When the looking turned toward itself, there was nothing there to turn toward. The ignorance had been the looking-away, and when the looking-away stopped, there was just—looking. Just seeing. Just this.

The moment came quietly.

No light from heaven. No thunder, no earthquake, no cosmic announcement. The tree's shadow did not change. The birds continued their distant calling. A child's voice rose and fell in the village. The leaves moved in the wind that was always moving.

But a shift occurred. What had been almost-there for longer than counting could count stopped being almost and became simply—here.

What remains isn't a thing that remains. It's what happens when the categories stop being believed in.

No one sat under the tree. Sitting happened.
No one completed. Completion arose.
No one became anything. Becoming stopped being necessary.

The body breathed. The heart beat. The blood moved in its ancient patterns through vessels that would continue for years or decades before failing. All of it: still the wheel. Still the meat, the form, the conditioned arising and passing that made experience possible.

But seen now. Illuminated rather than escaped. Understood rather than transcended.

The wheel didn't stop turning. The teaching wasn't about stopping the wheel. It was about seeing the wheel—seeing it clearly, completely, without the distortion of grasping or aversion—and in seeing it, no longer being turned by it.

---

What the world-system had been waiting for was now present.

As function rather than entity—there was no entity to be present. As what happens when what blocked teaching is removed rather than achievement—achievement required someone to achieve and a thing to be achieved. As the space that opens when the one who would have claimed the space is seen through.

Teaching could happen now. What had prevented teaching was gone. The clear seeing that had dissolved the fetters had never been owned, never been the possession of a self that could claim it. And what was owned could be hoarded. It could only be... available.

The village waited, though it didn't know what it waited for. The world waited, though it couldn't name its waiting. The wheel continued turning, carrying beings through births and deaths, hungers and releases, the endless motion that was its nature. And now, in this village, beneath this tree, on this morning—a presence that could show the wheel to those who turned on it.

To illuminate rather than to stop the turning. The wheel was what they were, what everything was, rather than a prison from which beings needed liberation. But to illuminate. To show the pattern from outside the pattern. To point at what had always been visible but had never been seen.

Rising happened.

The body stood, legs unfolding from the sitting position, weight shifting onto feet that pressed against the ground shaped by ancient roots. The tree remained behind, old and patient, available for the next one who needed to sit, to think, to let completion happen.

The village was visible through the break in the canopy. Houses of wood and stone. Smoke rising from chimneys. People moving through their morning, living lives that were good and still the wheel, that were beautiful and still conditioned.

They would gather. Because the moment would call them—would simply call. The way the bread was baked each morning without schedule, the way the water was drawn without command. They would sense what had happened without being able to name it, and they would come.

And words would arise. What needed to be said, finding the mouths that could say it, rather than teachings prepared or doctrine rehearsed.

The body walked toward the village.

Ready for what came next.
