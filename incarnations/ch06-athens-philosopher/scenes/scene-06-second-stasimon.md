The smell had become a presence—thick, sweetish, inescapable. It seeped through cloth pressed to mouths, through shuttered windows, through the incense burning in temples where priests no longer gathered. The unburied dead lay in doorways and against walls, in the shadows of stoas where philosophers had once debated the nature of the good. Flies gathered in clouds that darkened the light.

In the Agora, a litter passed through the abandoned stalls. The bearers moved slowly, their faces covered, their backs bent beneath a canopy of fine linen. Within the litter sat a man whose name had once meant Athens itself—Pericles, first citizen, the voice that had promised glory and delivered war. His robes hung loose on a frame the fever had already begun to hollow. His eyes, still sharp beneath their shadowed lids, watched the city he had shaped slide toward dissolution.

He did not stop the litter. He did not issue commands. The Assembly had scattered, the fleet lay becalmed, and the strategy that would have won the war required a population alive enough to outlast it. He passed through the Agora like a ghost reviewing the ruin of his own making, and the few citizens who saw him did not call out, did not petition, did not beg for the guidance that had brought them here.

The litter disappeared toward the Acropolis. The Parthenon caught the dying light above, its marble still perfect, still white, still serenely indifferent to the bodies piled at its base.

In the small room that had become his world, Philon laid the Scythian woman on the last clean pallet. Her breathing had steadied during the walk—a fragile improvement, nothing more, the kind that gave hope only to the inexperienced. He knew better. He had watched a hundred such stabilizations give way to final collapse.

He wet a cloth, pressed it to her forehead, felt the heat radiating from skin that had begun to mottle.

*If I had gone to Eleusis.*

The thought arrived unbidden, unwelcome—a splinter working its way to the surface of his mind. He pressed it down. Focused on the cloth, the water, the simple mechanics of care.

*The potter's wife would have no one. The woman in the corner—the one who keeps calling for her son—*

He wrung out the cloth, dipped it again.

*Alexios was right. The arithmetic is sound. One life against—*

"Water."

Her voice was barely audible, cracked with thirst. Philon poured water into a cup, held it to her lips, watched her drink in small desperate swallows.

The arithmetic did not matter. The numbers did not heal. The only truth he had ever understood was the one before him: a woman drinking water, alive in this moment, afraid and in pain and *here*.

He set down the cup. The doubt retreated, not defeated but suppressed—a wound sutured shut without healing, waiting beneath the surface.

Outside, the pyres burned on, and the smell of the city's dead settled over Athens like a second darkness.
