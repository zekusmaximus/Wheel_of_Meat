The pyres burned without ceasing.

By day they sent columns of greasy smoke into the summer sky, obscuring the marble face of Athena atop the Acropolis. By night they glowed like scattered embers across the city, their light orange and constant, a mockery of the hearth fires that had once meant home. The smell of burning was everywhere now—not the clean smell of cooking meat or the sacred fragrance of sacrifice, but something else. Something that caught in the throat and would not leave.

The rites had broken first. For generations, Athenians had buried their dead with care: the washing of the body, the coin placed beneath the tongue for Charon, the lamentations sung through the night, the procession at dawn. The departed deserved passage. The living deserved closure. The gods deserved observance.

But the dead came faster than the living could honor them.

Bodies accumulated in streets and alleyways, in the porticoes of temples, in the courtyards of houses whose owners had themselves fallen. Those who remained healthy enough to move learned to step around the swelling forms, to cover their mouths against the stench, to look away from the flies that gathered in black clouds wherever flesh lay exposed. The corpses became obstacles, then features of the landscape, then simply part of what Athens was now.

Some families still tried. They wrapped their dead in whatever cloth remained and carried them on wooden boards toward the burial grounds beyond the walls. But the burial grounds were full, and the grounds beyond those were full, and eventually even the most devoted mourners found themselves standing at the edge of already-burning pyres, their loved one's body in their arms, and no ceremony left to give.

They threw the bodies onto other men's fires. They built their own pyres from broken furniture and doorframes, lit them with whatever flame was near, and walked away before the burning was done. The prayers, when there were prayers, were brief—not appeals to the gods but acknowledgments of defeat. *You are gone. I could not save you. I cannot even give you rest.*

In the agora, the philosophers who had debated justice and virtue fell silent or fled. The courts closed. The Assembly met once, perhaps twice, and then abandoned all pretense of governance. What laws could hold when the lawgivers were dying? What justice could matter when survival itself had become the only currency?

The Parthenon remained. White and perfect against the smoke-darkened sky, its columns still catching the morning light as they had for twenty years, its friezes still depicting the gods in their eternal triumph. The temple did not care what happened below. The gods, if they watched at all, watched with the same serene indifference they had always shown—beautiful, immortal, unreachable.

Athens was burning its dead in the streets, and the gods looked on, and said nothing.

The smoke rose. The pyres burned. And somewhere in the city, a physician worked on.
