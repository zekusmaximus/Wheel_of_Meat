The night came without mercy, thick with smoke and the sounds of the dying city. Through the single window of the small room, Philon could see the glow of funeral pyres painting the darkness orange, their flames the only light in a city that had forgotten how to live. The woman on the pallet had not spoken again since her single word—*water*—but her breathing continued, ragged and shallow, proof that somewhere within the wreckage of her body, something still fought.

He had closed the door. Barred it. The others in the outer room—three women and two men who might yet recover, who had a chance if they received care through the night—would have to wait. He had left them water, clean cloths, the herbs that might ease their fevers. It was not enough. He knew it was not enough.

The Scythian woman's skin had darkened in the hours since he carried her here, the pustules spreading from her neck to her chest in a pattern he had seen before. Two days. Perhaps three. The disease would not be hurried, and it would not be denied. All he could offer was presence—the simple fact that when she opened her eyes, someone would be there.

He wrung out the cloth again, the water in the basin already warm from the heat of her fever. Pressed it to her forehead, her temples, the hollows of her throat where her pulse still beat, erratic and too fast. Her eyes moved beneath their lids, dreaming whatever the dying dream.

*I should sleep.*

The thought arrived from far away, irrelevant. He had not slept in two days. The edges of his vision had begun to blur, a warning he had learned to ignore. Sleep was for physicians who intended to survive, and that question had been answered when he barred the door.

He studied her face in the lamplight—the high cheekbones of the Scythian people, the bronze undertone of her skin now mottled with the plague's signature decay. She was perhaps thirty years old. Someone's daughter, once. Perhaps someone's mother. The owners who had abandoned her at his gate had not troubled themselves to mention her name.

He wondered if she remembered it herself.

Near midnight, she woke.

Her eyes found him in the darkness—dark eyes, fever-bright, confused at first and then settling into something else. Recognition, perhaps, though he had never seen her before this day. Or perhaps simply the understanding that she was no longer alone.

"Physician," she said. Her Greek was halting, accented, the words chosen with care from a vocabulary that did not belong to her. "You stayed."

"I am here." He lifted the cup to her lips, watched her drink. The simple act of swallowing seemed to cost her everything she had. "Try to rest."

She shook her head—a small movement, barely more than a tremor. "No rest. No..." She searched for a word, failed to find it, settled for another. "No hope. I know this."

He did not contradict her. The disease did not permit false comfort, and she had earned the truth.

"Then why?" She was watching him with an intensity that belied her weakness, her eyes searching his face as though the answer lay written there. "The others—they run. The masters, the other physicians, the priests. All run." Her breath caught, steadied. "Why do you stay?"

The question hung in the air between them, heavier than the smoke, older than the plague.

Philon set down the cup. His hands—the hands that had touched a thousand bodies, that had learned every texture of suffering—rested on his knees. He thought of the man in the doorway, twenty years ago. The physician who had turned away. The look in that dying man's eyes, not anger but something worse: resignation. The understanding that he was not worth saving.

"Because someone must," he said.

It was not an answer. It was the absence of one—a deflection dressed as principle. She seemed to understand this, her cracked lips pulling into something that was almost a smile.

"But why *you*?" Her hand moved on the pallet, found his wrist, gripped it with strength he had not thought she still possessed. Her fingers were hot, the skin dry and papery, but the pressure was deliberate. She was holding him in place, demanding that he see her. "You have... skill. You could heal many. Why waste..." She coughed, the sound wet and terrible, and he waited until it passed. "Why waste on one slave?"

The room was very quiet. Outside, someone was screaming—a sound that had become so common in these days that it no longer registered as human pain, only as another note in the city's constant keening. The lamplight flickered, casting shadows that moved like living things.

"You are not a waste," Philon said.

She closed her eyes. The grip on his wrist loosened but did not release.

"The masters said this. *A waste.* Too old to sell. Too sick to—" She stopped, gathered herself. "They said I should die in the street. Not dirty their house."

He covered her hand with his own. The contact was electric, intimate—a gesture that carried the weight of everything he believed. Physician to patient. Human to human. The only answer he had ever understood.

"They were wrong," he said.

She died three hours before dawn.

The end came quietly, as it often did when the body had already fought its longest battle. Her breathing slowed, grew shallow, hesitated—then stopped, like a sentence interrupted mid-thought. Her eyes were half-open, still fixed on some point beyond the lamp's reach, still carrying the question she had asked him. *Why you? Why waste on one slave?*

Philon sat with her for a long time after. The lamp burned low, then lower, its flame guttering in the smoke-thick air. He had closed her eyes, arranged her hands on her chest, performed the small rites that custom demanded and that no one else would perform. She had never told him her name. He had never asked. In the end, it had not mattered—she had been herself, complete, a life that deserved witness.

The city's sounds continued outside: the distant roar of pyres, the occasional cry, the endless coughing that rose from every quarter. The others in the outer room would be waking soon, would need water, would need care. There was still work to be done.

He rose from the stool where he had kept vigil.

And coughed.

The sound surprised him—a dry, scratching sensation in the back of his throat, the kind of irritation that could mean anything or nothing. The smoke, perhaps. The exhaustion. The long hours in close quarters with the dying.

He coughed again.

This time, there was heat behind it. A faint burning in his chest, just beneath the breastbone, familiar in the way that certain knowledge is familiar—the way a man recognizes the face of an enemy he has always known he would meet.

Philon stood very still in the pre-dawn darkness, his hand pressed to his chest, his breath coming in short careful measures. The lamp had finally guttered out. The woman lay on the pallet, at peace, beyond the reach of the disease that had killed her.

Beyond the reach of everything.

He lowered his hand. Looked at it in the darkness, though there was nothing to see. The same hand that had touched her fever-hot skin, that had pressed cloths to her forehead, that had held the cup to her lips. The hand that had refused to close a door.

Outside, the first gray light of morning was beginning to seep through the smoke. The pyres had burned down during the night, but they would be rebuilt, would be burning again by noon. There was always more fuel. There were always more dead.

Philon opened the door and walked into the outer room, where the living still waited.
