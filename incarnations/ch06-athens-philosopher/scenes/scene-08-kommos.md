He worked through that first day with the fever already building behind his eyes—a pressure that made the light too sharp, the sounds too near. The five patients in the outer room needed water, needed their dressings changed, needed the simple presence of someone who had not fled. He gave them what he could. His hands moved through the familiar motions: cloth wrung, fever checked, pulse counted. The work itself was steady, even if the man performing it was not.

By evening, he could no longer lift the water basin.

The weight of it—twenty pounds, perhaps less—defeated him utterly. He stood over it with his arms trembling, his breath coming in short gasps that each carried a new heat deeper into his chest, and understood that something fundamental had changed. The basin did not move. He did not make it move. After a time that might have been minutes or hours, he sat down on the floor beside it and watched the lamplight flicker across the water's surface.

One of the patients—the young man with the best chance, the one who had been drinking broth since morning—came to him. Philon felt hands on his shoulders, heard words that arrived from a great distance, muffled by the roaring in his ears. The young man was speaking. Asking something. Philon could not parse the question, could only see the man's lips moving and think, with strange detachment, that this was how the woman from Scythia must have felt. This dissolution of meaning. This retreat into pure sensation.

They put him on a pallet. He did not remember agreeing to lie down.

The fever dreams came in fragments, shattered images that carried the weight of prophecy even as they refused to cohere. He saw the Agora empty, its columns casting shadows over bare stone where no merchants stood. He saw the Long Walls, the refugees pressed against them like grain in an overfull sack, their faces interchangeable, their hands reaching. He saw pyres burning in daylight, the smoke rising to join a sky already gray with ash.

He saw the woman from Scythia. She was standing at the foot of his pallet, watching him with fever-bright eyes that no longer held fever, no longer held anything at all. Her mouth moved, but the words that emerged belonged to someone else—to Alexios, perhaps, or to the magistrate, or to the man in the doorway twenty years ago who had closed his door and turned away.

*If we both die, who treats the hundred?*

He tried to answer her. His lips cracked with the effort, tasting blood and ash.

*One life is worth the effort.*

But the dream-woman shook her head, patient and sad, and in her expression he saw what he had not allowed himself to see before: the question beneath the question, the doubt that lived at the root of his certainty.

The city continued outside.

He heard it through the walls, through the fever that made every sound both distant and immediate—the crackle of pyres, the cries that rose and fell like breathing, the silence that came after. Athens was dying around him, and he was dying inside it, and the parallel felt less like tragedy than like simple arithmetic. One physician, subtracted. Fifty patients, a hundred, two hundred, who would never receive his care. The mathematics of mercy, reduced at last to its bleakest form.

*I chose one.*

The thought surfaced through the delirium, clean and cold.

*I chose one woman when the many were waiting. I told myself it was virtue. I told myself it was what a healer must do.*

He coughed, and the cough became a convulsion, and the convulsion became a descent into red darkness where nothing remained but heat and the sound of his own labored breathing.

*But was the one for her—or for me?*

The question had no answer. It was not meant to have one. It was the sound a man makes when he realizes, too late, that the door he refused to close has closed behind him anyway, and he is the one locked inside.

He had become the physician who abandons. Not through refusal, but through death—through choosing a martyrdom that would leave the hundred without anyone at all. The binding memory that had shaped his life had led him here, to a pallet in a plague-ridden city, to the understanding that came only when understanding could no longer save him.

*There must be a way,* he thought, or the fever thought for him. *A way to serve without destroying. A way to give without emptying. A way to love the one without abandoning the many.*

But the insight was smoke, was ash, was the gray dawn light filtering through windows he could no longer see. It did not crystallize into wisdom. It only hurt—a last bright pain that would not resolve into peace.

On the third day, his fever broke.

Not into recovery. Into stillness.

He lay on the pallet and felt his body becoming foreign to him, a thing of meat and bone that had carried him through forty years and would carry him no further. His breathing slowed. His heartbeat became a question asked at longer and longer intervals. The pressure behind his eyes released into something almost like relief.

He thought of the woman from Scythia, whose name he had never learned. He thought of Alexios, who had been right. He thought of the hundred patients he would never treat, and the thousand after them, and the understanding that had come too late to matter.

*The one was for me,* he admitted finally, to no one, to everyone. *I could not bear to be the man who refused. So I became the man who died instead.*

It was not virtue. It was fear wearing virtue's face.

The knowledge settled into him like water into sand—absorbed, diffused, already fading. He would not live long enough to act on it. He would only carry it with him into whatever came next.

If anything came next.

The light in the room was very gentle now. The sounds of the city had grown distant. Somewhere, the living still needed help, and he could no longer give it.

Philon closed his eyes.
