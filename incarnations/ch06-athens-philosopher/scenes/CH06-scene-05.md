The magistrate came at dawn, when the smoke from the pyres lay thickest over the city.

Philon heard him before he saw him—the measured cadence of official sandals on stone, deliberate and unhurried, the footsteps of a man who still believed in order. The clinic had become a place where such men no longer came. Kallias ducked through the doorway with a cloth pressed to his mouth, his eyes scanning the rows of the sick as though counting livestock.

"Philon of Kephissia." The magistrate's voice was muffled but clear. "The Council has reached a decision."

Philon did not rise from his patient—a potter's wife whose fever had broken in the night, her survival as unexpected as it was fragile. He pressed a damp cloth to her forehead, felt the warmth receding beneath his palm. "I am honored by the Council's attention."

"You are ordered to relocate to the estates at Eleusis." Kallias remained by the door, as far from the sick as the small room would allow. "You and any assistants still living. The road is passable if you leave within the hour."

"Eleusis." Philon's hands did not pause in their work. "Where the wealthy have already fled."

"Where you will be useful. The families who hold our treasury, our fleet captains, our generals—they require physicians. You waste your skills here." The magistrate gestured at the bodies around them, a wave of his hand that dismissed thirty lives. "These will die whether you treat them or not. The men who can rebuild Athens require protection."

Philon finally looked up. Kallias's face was rigid with the certainty of necessity—a man who had made his peace with triage and could not understand why anyone else hesitated. There was no cruelty in his expression, which made it worse. He genuinely believed he was extending mercy.

"I will remain."

"This is not a request."

"Then I must disobey." Philon rose, his knees aching from hours kneeling on stone. He was aware of how he must appear—unwashed, exhausted, his chiton stained with fluids he preferred not to name. "What meaning has a healer who abandons the dying to tend those who might live regardless?"

Kallias's jaw tightened. "The meaning is Athens. The meaning is survival of the city-state. You serve the polis, physician—not your own conscience."

"The polis is here." Philon gestured at the rows of suffering. "The polis is in the Long Walls, crammed ten to a room because we told them the walls would protect them from Spartan spears. We failed to mention the walls would not protect them from each other's breath."

For a moment, something flickered in Kallias's eyes—recognition, perhaps, or suppressed guilt. Then it vanished. "I will report your refusal to the Council. Do not expect protection."

"I stopped expecting protection when the funeral rites ended."

The magistrate left. The potter's wife stirred, mumbled something about water. Philon fetched it, held the cup to her cracked lips, and tried not to count the hours until the next crisis arrived.

Alexios found him near midday, though the smoke made the sun difficult to track. The young man stood in the doorway where Kallias had stood, his face gray with exhaustion, his hands trembling at his sides. Philon had watched those hands perform careful suturing, mix precise doses, steady themselves through procedures that would have broken older men. Now they shook as though palsied.

"There is a woman at the eastern gate," Alexios said. His voice was flat. "The guards will not let her in."

"Sick?"

"Dying." Alexios did not move from the threshold. "A household slave. Her owners abandoned her when the fever came. She walked here from the Piraeus district. The guards say she collapsed against the gate and will not rise."

Philon was already gathering his supplies—the few herbs that remained, the clean cloths he had boiled that morning, the water jug he refilled from the public fountain before the crowds gathered. "Then we bring her inside."

"No."

The word hung in the air. Philon looked up from his bag, studied his assistant's face—the dark circles beneath his eyes, the tension in his jaw, the way his gaze slid away from direct contact. A change had come in the night. A change Philon could not name.

"Alexios."

"I cannot." The young man's voice cracked, steadied, cracked again. "I cannot follow you to her."

Philon set down his bag. Slowly, with the same unhurried attention he gave to every patient, he crossed the small space between them. Alexios flinched as though expecting a blow, then stood rigid when Philon simply stopped before him—close enough to touch, not touching.

"Tell me."

"If we both die treating one slave—" Alexios's throat worked. "If we both die, who treats the hundred waiting in this room? You taught me that, Philon. You taught me that a physician's life belongs to his patients. *All* of them. Not just the one in front of us."

The argument struck clean and true, a blade finding the gap in armor Philon had not known he wore. For a moment he could not answer. Alexios stood before him, repeating words Philon himself had spoken in better days—words about duty, about proportion, about the cold arithmetic of mercy.

"She is dying alone," Philon said finally. "Because she was property, and her owners grew afraid."

"And if you die beside her, you will save no one else. Ever. The hundred in this room will become two hundred, three hundred, and you will be ash on a pyre you never chose."

"I cannot be the man who abandons her."

"Then be the man who saves the others!" Alexios's composure shattered. Tears cut paths through the grime on his face, his voice rising to something between a plea and a scream. "Let me go to Eleusis—let me survive this—and I will return when the dying is done. I will carry what you taught me forward. But I cannot—I cannot follow you into that darkness, Philon. I cannot watch you die for a woman whose name you do not even know."

The silence stretched. Outside, the pyres crackled. Somewhere distant, a woman wailed—grief or madness, impossible to tell.

Philon thought of the physician who had closed his door. The man who had weighed one life against his own and found the stranger wanting. He thought of the face in that doorway, the calculation in those eyes, the way he had felt something fracture in his chest when the door swung shut.

He could not become that man. Even if Alexios was right. Even if the arithmetic was sound.

"Go to Eleusis," Philon said. His voice emerged steady, though he did not feel steady. "Find the physicians there. Learn what you can. And when this is over—if there is an after—remember what I taught you. Not the dying. The living."

Alexios stared at him. The tears had stopped, leaving salt-tracks on his cheeks. "You will not come."

"I will not come."

"She is one life, Philon. One life against all the lives you could still save."

"One life is still a life." Philon picked up his bag again, settled it across his shoulder. "That is all I have ever believed. That is all I can offer."

Alexios opened his mouth as if to argue further, then closed it. A current passed between them—neither understanding nor agreement, but an older and sadder recognition. The knowledge that love does not prevent separation. That two people can see the same truth and draw opposite conclusions.

"I will remember you," Alexios said. "When I teach others. I will tell them what you were."

"Tell them what I tried to be. The being is beyond my control."

The young man turned and walked away. His footsteps faded into the rumble of the dying city. Philon watched until he could no longer distinguish the sound, then shouldered his bag and stepped out into the smoke.

The street stood empty. The doorway behind him held only silence where Alexios's footsteps had been. Something tightened in Philon's chest—a cold that had nothing to do with the Mediterranean sun, an ancient wrongness that bypassed thought. For an instant he felt the absence of other bodies as a wound, as though solitude itself were closing in like stone walls he had never seen.

The sensation passed as quickly as it had come, leaving only the faint impression of snow where no snow fell.

He walked faster, toward the eastern gate, toward the woman who needed him.

---

He found her where Alexios had described—slumped against the eastern gate, her body forming a dark heap against the pale stone. The guards had retreated to a distance, their faces covered, their spears pointed outward as though the sickness were an enemy that could be stabbed.

Philon knelt beside her.

She was younger than he had expected, perhaps twenty years, her features foreign in a way that spoke of Scythia or the northern steppes. Her skin was mottled with the plague's familiar marks—the flush of fever giving way to the livid patches that preceded the end. Her breathing came in shallow gasps, each one a small battle against lungs filling with fluid.

He took her hand. The gesture was deliberate—a statement, though she likely could not understand it. *I am here. You are not alone.*

Her eyes opened. Dark, unfocused, struggling to find him through the fever's haze.

"You... physician?" Her Greek was broken, the words forced through lips that barely moved.

"Yes."

She seemed to consider this, as though the information required processing. Then, with effort that must have cost her everything she had left: "Why?"

Philon had no answer. Or rather, he had too many—none of them adequate, none of them true enough to speak aloud. *Because I made a vow. Because I cannot be the man who closes doors. Because one life matters, even when the world says it does not.*

"Because you are here," he said instead. "And so am I."

Her eyes closed. Her fingers tightened briefly around his—a grip without strength, gratitude expressed through the only language her body still possessed.

Philon lifted her as gently as he could, feeling her weight settle against his chest. She was light—too light, the fever having consumed whatever substance she once held. He carried her through streets lined with the dying and the dead, past pyres that smoked and flared, past the temples where gods looked on in marble silence.

He did not know her name. He would never learn it. But he carried her toward his clinic, toward the small room where he would tend her until one of them stopped breathing, and he did not look back.

The gate stood empty behind him. Alexios was gone. The magistrate was gone. The healthy had fled or hidden, and the sick lay where they fell.

Philon walked on, the woman in his arms, the smoke closing around them like a shroud.
