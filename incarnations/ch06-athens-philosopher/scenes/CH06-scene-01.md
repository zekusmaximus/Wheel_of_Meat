Dawn broke over Athens like a promise the city had not yet learned to doubt. The marble of the Parthenon caught the first light and held it, gleaming above the Agora with a confidence that seemed permanent, though nothing in the world of men ever was. The marketplace stirred before the sun cleared the eastern hills—vendors arranging amphoras of oil, stacking loaves of barley bread, unrolling lengths of linen dyed saffron and indigo. The air smelled of fresh-baked grain and animal dung, wood smoke and the salt carried inland from Piraeus. A good morning in a great city, or so it appeared to those who had not yet learned what was coming.

Philon of Kephissia moved through the Agora with the measured pace of a man who had long since stopped hurrying. He was lean in the way of those who forget to eat, his chiton hanging loose at the shoulders, the dark wool faded from too many washings. Sun and sleepless nights had carved lines into his face that made him look older than his years, though his hands remained steady—callused at the fingertips, stained faintly with the residue of poultices and tinctures. He carried a leather satchel slung across one shoulder, its weight familiar and unremarkable.

He paused at the edge of the butcher's stalls, though he had no need to buy. The carcasses hung on iron hooks, stripped of hide and opened to the morning air—goats and sheep, the occasional pig. Flesh that had been walking the day before, now reduced to cuts and portions, waiting to be weighed and carried home. The butchers worked with practiced efficiency, knives flashing as they separated muscle from bone, their aprons dark with blood that would never fully wash clean. Philon watched them for a moment longer than necessary, his gaze quiet and assessing. He had always been a man who observed before acting, who looked for patterns in what others dismissed as chaos.

A voice called his name from across the square. He turned, already knowing who it would be.

Alexios threaded his way through the morning crowd with the easy energy of youth, his stride quick and unencumbered by doubt. He was perhaps twenty-two or twenty-three, broad-shouldered and clean-shaven, his chiton white enough to suggest he still had someone at home who cared how he appeared in public. His face brightened when he reached Philon, the kind of open admiration that made older men both grateful and uneasy.

"You're early," Alexios said, falling into step beside him. "I thought I'd be the first to the clinic."

"I didn't sleep well," Philon said, which was true, though it was also true that he rarely slept well anymore. "There's no virtue in arriving before the work begins."

"There's virtue in being prepared for it." Alexios gestured toward the satchel. "What have you brought today?"

"Willow bark. Garlic. Clean linen." Philon's voice carried the dry precision of a man reciting an inventory he had memorized long ago. "The same as yesterday. The same as tomorrow."

They walked together past the stalls selling pottery and bronze, past the men already gathered in clusters to argue about the war or the latest vote in the Assembly. Pericles had addressed them two days prior, his voice ringing across the Pnyx with the certainty of a man who believed Athens could withstand anything Sparta might attempt. The Long Walls stood finished, connecting the city to the harbor, a double line of stone that made Athens an island within its own territory. Impregnable, Pericles had called it. Philon had heard the speech and said nothing, because he had learned that certainty and truth were not always the same thing.

The clinic occupied a modest building near the edge of the Agora, a single room with a packed-earth floor and shutters that could be opened to let in light and air. Philon had worked there for six years, tending to injuries and illnesses that wealthier citizens took to private physicians in their own homes. A sprained ankle from a fall on wet stone. A fever that wouldn't break. A wound gone sour with infection. The people who came to him were laborers and freedmen, potters and tanners, the occasional slave sent by an owner too miserly to pay for better care. Philon treated them all with the same attention, which some saw as nobility and others as an inability to distinguish what mattered from what did not.

By mid-morning, three patients had already come and gone. A boy with a deep gash on his forearm, sustained while helping his father load amphorae onto a cart. An old woman whose joints ached so badly she could barely walk, though there was little Philon could do beyond offering her willow bark and words that were kinder than honest. A young man with a cough that rattled in his chest like stones in a jar, the sound wet and thick. Philon had listened to his breathing, noted the pallor of his skin, and sent him away with instructions to rest and drink warm broths, knowing the advice was insufficient and knowing also that nothing he could offer would be enough.

Alexios watched him work with the focus of a student trying to memorize not just the techniques but the thinking behind them. He asked questions—why this herb and not another, how to know when a wound required cautery, whether it was safe to bleed a patient who had already lost blood from injury. Philon answered patiently, though part of him wondered whether he was teaching the young man anything worth knowing, or simply passing on the limits of what could be done.

"You hesitate before you touch them," Alexios observed, after the old woman had shuffled out into the sunlight. "Why is that?"

Philon paused in the act of cleaning his hands in a basin of water. The question was more perceptive than he had expected. "I watch first," he said. "The body tells you things before you lay hands on it. How a person holds themselves. Where they flinch. What they try to hide."

"And once you've watched?"

"Then I act." Philon dried his hands on a length of linen, the gesture deliberate and unhurried. "Touch is not neutral. It can heal or harm, comfort or violate. You have to know which you're offering."

Alexios nodded, though Philon could see he didn't fully understand yet. Understanding came from experience, and experience came from years that the young man had not yet lived.

The morning stretched toward midday. The clinic emptied. Philon sat on a low stool near the door, his back against the wall, and allowed himself a moment of stillness that felt less like rest than like the exhaustion of a man who had forgotten how to stop. His eyes drifted closed. The sounds of the Agora filtered in—vendors calling out prices, children laughing, the rhythmic clang of a blacksmith's hammer striking heated bronze.

And beneath it all, faint and unwelcome, the memory that never fully left him.

He had been younger then. Twenty, perhaps. Still learning his trade under an older physician whose name he could no longer recall without effort. There had been a sickness that year—not a plague, but something close enough to make people afraid. Fever and lesions, a handful of deaths. Not enough to empty the city, but enough to make physicians cautious.

A man had come to the door of the clinic, stumbling and feverish, his skin marked with the telltale signs of infection. He had begged for help. Philon's teacher had looked at him for a long moment, his face unreadable, and then closed the door. The man had stood outside, pleading, his voice growing weaker. Philon had watched through the gap in the shutters as the man finally collapsed. No one came to help him. By the next morning, he was dead.

"Why didn't you treat him?" Philon had asked.

The older physician had looked at him with something that might have been pity or might have been contempt. "Because I choose to live," he said. "And if you want to survive in this profession, you'll learn to make the same choice."

Philon had not made the same choice. He had sworn to himself, standing over that man's body as it was carried away without ceremony, that he would never be the physician who closed the door. That he would never refuse someone who came to him for help, no matter the risk, no matter the cost.

It had seemed like a vow worth making at the time. It had seemed like virtue.

"Philon?"

He opened his eyes. Alexios stood in the doorway, silhouetted against the bright square beyond. The young man's expression was uncertain, as though he wasn't sure whether to speak.

"What is it?"

Alexios glanced over his shoulder, then stepped closer and lowered his voice. "There are rumors," he said. "From Piraeus. They're saying people are falling ill. Fever. Delirium. Some of them are dying."

Philon felt something tighten in his chest, a sensation that was not quite fear and not quite recognition. He rose to his feet slowly, his joints stiff from sitting. "Rumors are not the same as truth," he said.

"No," Alexios agreed. "But they're not always lies, either."

Philon moved to the doorway and looked out at the Agora. The city gleamed in the midday sun, proud and beautiful and utterly unaware. The Parthenon stood above it all, white marble against a sky so blue it hurt to look at. A city that believed itself untouchable. A city that had not yet learned what it meant to be afraid.

"Then we prepare," Philon said quietly. "And we wait."

He did not say what he was waiting for. He did not need to.

The morning's promise had already begun to curdle into something else, though no one in the Agora seemed to notice yet. They went on buying and selling, arguing and laughing, living their lives as though the world would continue unchanged.

Philon knew better. He had always known better.

He stood in the doorway and watched, and did not move.
