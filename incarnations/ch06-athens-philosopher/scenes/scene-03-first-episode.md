The city changed within a fortnight.

What had been rumor became fact, and what had been one man collapsed in the Agora became dozens, then scores, then numbers that Philon stopped trying to count. The dead accumulated faster than the living could carry them. The Long Walls—those great stone corridors connecting Athens to the sea—had filled with refugees from the countryside, families fleeing Spartan raids who crowded together in makeshift shelters of canvas and salvaged timber. They had come seeking protection behind the city's defenses. They found, instead, the perfect conditions for plague.

Philon worked until his hands cracked and his vision blurred at the edges. His clinic—little more than a converted storeroom near the Hephaisteion—had become a way station for the dying. The pallets he had arranged with such care were now occupied day and night, bodies pressed so close that when one patient coughed, the sound rippled outward through the room like a stone dropped in still water. The air itself had thickened, heavy with the smell of fever-sweat and the herbs he burned in futile attempts at purification.

The rumors had shifted in recent days, grown sharper and more dangerous. The plague, some now whispered, had arrived on Persian ships—merchant vessels that had slipped into Piraeus harbor carrying more than grain and olive oil. The Medes had poisoned the water, poisoned the air, poisoned the very stones of the city. A different whisper claimed the refugees themselves were to blame, country people carrying country diseases into the clean streets of Athens. Both stories spread faster than the illness they pretended to explain, and with them came fear's natural children: suspicion and division.

Metics who had lived in Athens for decades found themselves turned away from water fountains. Families with foreign-sounding names discovered their neighbors would no longer speak to them. The crowd's xenophobia, always present beneath the surface of Athenian democracy, had risen like bile in a sick man's throat. Philon watched it happen with the same helpless clarity he brought to observing a patient's decline—able to diagnose, unable to cure.

And so they came to him. The ones turned away elsewhere. The ones whose neighbors had closed their doors. The ones who had nowhere else to go.

"There is no more room," Alexios said, standing in the doorway with his arms crossed against his chest. The gesture might have looked like defiance to someone who did not know him. Philon recognized it as protection—the young man holding himself together by force of will. "We cannot fit another body in this space."

"Then we will treat them in the street."

"The magistrates—"

"Will object. Yes." Philon did not look up from the woman whose pustules he was cleaning. The lesions had spread across her arms and chest, angry red circles that wept when touched and crusted over when left alone. She had stopped speaking yesterday; her eyes followed his movements with the mute gratitude of an animal that knows it is being helped without understanding how. "Let them object."

The magistrates did more than object. They arrived at midday, three men in the fine linen chitons of citizens with property and leisure, their faces arranged in expressions of concerned authority. Philon recognized one of them—Kallias, who sat on the Council of Five Hundred and had once praised the public physicians for their service to the polis. That seemed very long ago now.

"Philon of Kephissia." Kallias spoke the name as if testing whether it still belonged to the man before him. "You have been summoned to relocate your practice to the upper city. The Council requires physicians of skill to attend to citizens of standing."

Philon continued his work, his fingers pressing a poultice against a feverish man's forehead. The patient was a harbor worker, his hands calloused from ropes and his skin weathered from sun. Not a citizen of standing. Not a man whose death would trouble the Council's ledgers.

"I am needed here," Philon said.

"You are needed where the city decides you are needed." Kallias stepped closer, though not too close—maintaining the distance that fear demanded. "Athens cannot afford to lose her trained physicians to"—he gestured at the crowded room, the street beyond where more sick had gathered—"to this."

"And yet Athens is losing her people. Here. Now. While we speak."

"There must be order." The magistrate's voice hardened. "The Council has determined that treatment shall be prioritized. Citizens first. Then metics of good standing. Then..." He trailed off, but the meaning was clear. Then slaves. Then foreigners. Then the ones nobody would claim.

Philon straightened. His back ached from hours of bending; his hands were raw from the work of touching what no one else would touch. He looked at Kallias—at the clean chiton, the oiled hair, the sandals that had not walked through the sick quarters—and felt something shift in his chest. Not anger, exactly. Something colder and more certain.

"A physician's oath," he said, "does not distinguish between the blood of a citizen and the blood of a slave."

"Your oath—"

"Is to healing. Not to ledgers." He held up his hands, still stained with the fluids of the dying. "When you can tell me which of these is citizen's blood and which is not, perhaps then I will sort my patients as the Council wishes."

Kallias's face underwent several transformations in quick succession—surprise, then offense, then something that might have been respect if it had been allowed to mature. What emerged instead was the careful blankness of a man who has decided to report a problem to his superiors rather than solve it himself.

"The Council will hear of this," he said.

"I hope they will. Perhaps then they will send more physicians instead of more demands."

The magistrates departed. The clinic remained. And Philon returned to his work, his hands finding their familiar rhythm against the fevered skin of the dying.

It was evening before he noticed Alexios had not spoken in hours.

The young man stood at the edge of the room, near the doorway where fresh air—such as it was—could still reach him. He was washing his hands in a basin, though Philon had watched him wash them three times already in the last hour. His movements had taken on a compulsive quality, the same gesture repeated as if repetition could somehow undo what he had already touched.

"You should rest," Philon said.

"I am not tired."

The lie hung between them, obvious and unaddressed. Alexios was exhausted—they both were—but exhaustion was not what drove the tremor in his hands or the way his eyes kept returning to the street outside, calculating distances, measuring routes of escape.

"I saw a boy today," Alexios said quietly. "Perhaps eight years old. His mother brought him to us, begged us to save him." He paused, his hands still moving in the basin though the water had long since grown cloudy. "He died within an hour. She would not release his body. She held him and held him, and when I tried to explain that we needed the space, she looked at me as if I were the one who had killed him."

Philon set down the cloth he had been using and crossed the room to stand beside his assistant. Outside, the funeral pyres had begun again—visible from this vantage as orange smears against the darkening sky, their smoke mingling with the haze that had settled over the city like a shroud.

"You did not kill him," Philon said. "The plague killed him. You tried to save him."

"Did I?" Alexios looked up, and in his eyes Philon saw something he had hoped not to see for many more years: the first fracture in a young man's faith. "Or did I simply watch him die while pretending my watching made a difference?"

Philon placed his hand on Alexios's shoulder. The gesture was meant to comfort, but he felt the younger man flinch beneath his touch—not quite a recoil, but close enough to make the meaning clear. Philon's hands had touched the plague. Philon's hands carried death.

"Watching matters," Philon said. "Bearing witness matters. The boy knew he was not alone."

"And if we had turned him away? Told his mother we had no room, no resources, no hope to offer? He would still have died. But we might have saved the next one, or the one after that."

"Perhaps." Philon withdrew his hand. "Or perhaps the next one would have died too, and we would have only added abandonment to our failures."

Alexios said nothing. He dried his hands on a cloth and walked back to his station, where another patient waited with glassy eyes and failing breath. He worked through the night without complaint, competent and careful, and he did not speak again of the boy or his mother.

But Philon watched him, as he watched everyone. And he saw what the young man was not yet willing to say aloud: that the question of whom to save and whom to abandon would not be answered by dedication alone. That love for individuals could become a betrayal of the many. That a door held open for one might close on hundreds.

He saw it. He understood it. And still he could not make himself believe it.

Outside, the pyres burned on. The smoke rose. And within the Long Walls, the plague continued its patient work—indifferent to oaths, indifferent to status, indifferent to the desperate arithmetic of survival that would undo them all.
