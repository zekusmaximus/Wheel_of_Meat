The collapse came three days later.

Philon had continued his work in the interval, treating the ailments that required no explanation—a child with an infected insect bite, a potter whose hand had slipped against the wheel, a woman whose pregnancy sat wrong in her body and would not settle. Each case he approached with the same unhurried attention, though beneath his calm he felt the tightening that comes before a storm. The rumors from Piraeus had multiplied, as rumors do, growing darker with each retelling. Sailors staggering from ships. Bodies left on the docks. Fever that burned so hot it cracked the lips and left the afflicted begging for water they could not keep down.

Alexios had stopped asking whether the stories were true. He had begun, instead, to watch the patients who came to the clinic with a wariness that had not been there before—searching their faces for signs of something more than ordinary illness, flinching slightly when they coughed or sneezed. Philon had noticed but said nothing. Fear was not unreasonable. Fear, in the right measure, could keep a man alive.

It was late morning when the scream cut across the Agora.

Philon was repacking his satchel, organizing the herbs and linen strips he had used on a tanner's infected foot, when the sound reached him—sharp, raw, the kind of cry that comes from genuine terror rather than theatrical distress. He straightened. Alexios appeared in the doorway, his face pale.

"Something's happened," the young man said. "In the market."

They moved together through the crowd, which was already beginning to shift and churn like water disturbed by a thrown stone. The vendors had stopped calling their prices. The arguments in the shade of the stoas had fallen silent. Everyone was looking in the same direction, and as Philon drew closer he saw why.

A man lay crumpled on the paving stones near the fish sellers' stalls. He had fallen in the middle of the walkway, his body twisted at an angle that suggested he had not even tried to catch himself. His chiton was soaked with sweat, though the morning was not especially warm, and his skin—visible where the fabric had ridden up—was flushed a dark, angry red. Even from a distance, Philon could see the tremors running through him, the involuntary shuddering of muscles that had lost their connection to will.

The crowd had opened around him like a wound. A ring of emptiness, three paces wide, separated the fallen man from the nearest onlookers. No one moved toward him. No one spoke to him. They only watched, their faces bearing the particular expression of people who have glimpsed something they do not wish to understand.

The man cried out again—not words, just sound, the raw vocalization of someone whose fever had burned away the capacity for speech. He tried to lift his head and failed. His hands clawed weakly at the stones beneath him.

Philon felt the binding memory rise in his chest: another man, another doorway, another moment when the choice had been made for him by someone else. He heard the older physician's voice as clearly as if the man stood beside him. *Because I choose to live.*

He stepped forward.

Behind him, Alexios made a small sound—not quite a word, not quite a gasp. The crowd parted further, giving Philon passage they would not have given themselves. He crossed the empty ring and knelt beside the fallen man, his knees pressing against the same stones that countless citizens had walked across that morning without thinking of what lay ahead.

The plague victim—for there was no other word that fit—turned his head at the touch of Philon's hand on his shoulder. His eyes were glassy, unfocused, rimmed with an inflammation that had already begun to spread. When he opened his mouth, what emerged was not language but a cracked whisper, a plea that needed no translation.

*Help me.*

Philon did not recoil. He did not calculate the risk or weigh the probabilities of contagion. He placed his palm against the man's forehead—hot as a fired clay pot, hot enough to feel through the calluses—and looked back toward the crowd.

They stood frozen. Watching. Waiting to see what he would do.

"Bring water," Philon said. His voice carried, steady and clear. "And a litter. He needs shade and rest."

No one moved.

"Now," he added, and something in the word finally broke the paralysis. A young vendor hurried toward the nearest fountain. Two older men who had been standing together exchanged a glance and then moved, reluctantly, to fetch a carrying frame from one of the market stalls.

Footsteps approached from behind. Philon did not turn, but he felt the presence settle beside him—Alexios, kneeling on the plague victim's other side, his hands already reaching for the waterskin he carried.

"One life," Philon said quietly, almost to himself. "One life is worth the effort."

Alexios looked at him, and in the young man's face Philon saw something that might have been admiration or might have been the first stirring of fear. "Yes," Alexios said. "But how many lives will this one cost?"

Philon did not answer. He did not know how to.

The man beneath his hands had stopped shaking. His breath came in shallow gasps, each one weaker than the last. Above them, the Parthenon gleamed in the sunlight, beautiful and indifferent, and the crowd stood at the edges of the empty circle, watching a physician touch what no one else would touch.

The door that Philon had sworn never to close had opened. He stepped through it without looking back.
