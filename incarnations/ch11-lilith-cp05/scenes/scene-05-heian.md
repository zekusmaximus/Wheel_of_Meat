# Scene V: Finding Heian Japan

She remained in her tracking corner, though the main session had ended. The question lingered at the edge of her attention like light through a closing door.

Where does the pendulum land?

Macarius died reaching for color, texture, softness. Fifteen years of denial compressed into a final hunger. That energy didn't dissipate—she had learned this across four years of watching. It shaped what came next. Seeds planted in death grew in the next configuration.

She closed her eyes. Lighter touch now—scanning rather than deep tracking. Using her own lives as temporal landmarks, the way she always did. Alexandria, where she had once been a physician's wife who outlived him. Spain, where she had followed armies as a sutler's daughter. Guangzhou, where she had washed the clothes of merchants who never learned her name.

Her lives scattered across centuries, waypoints on a map of time.

Forward from Egypt. The centuries blurred at the edges of her perception—Christianity spreading, transforming, fragmenting across territories. Cultures rising and falling at distances too great to distinguish. The thread she sought hummed somewhere in that blur, waiting to brighten.

And then—it did.

A court. Not the stark grandeur of Rome or the monumental ambition of empires she had glimpsed before. Something different. Elegance encoded in every gesture. Poetry as currency. Beauty elevated to something approaching religion.

She reached toward it, and the images sharpened:

Silk in colors the desert had never known—layered robes in plum and wisteria and the particular blue-green the Japanese would call *asagi*. Incense layered on incense, subtle as breath. Calligraphy practiced until the hand moved without thought, each stroke an act of devotion to form itself.

Aesthetic sensitivity refined to the point of paralysis.

The Heian court. Japan, perhaps 900 CE. A world where feeling was cultivated, analyzed, performed. Where the correct emotional response to falling leaves could make or break a reputation. Where aware—the particular ache of impermanence, the beauty of things precisely because they ended—was not just understood but endlessly demonstrated.

She found him.

A courtier. Young by his world's standards, beautiful by its conventions. Someone trained since childhood in the cultivation of aesthetic sensitivity. Someone who *felt*.

Everything Macarius denied, this one embraced. Color. Texture. The warmth of another body. The beauty of a well-turned phrase, a perfectly arranged sleeve, moonlight through paper screens. Sensation not as temptation but as spiritual practice.

And therein lay the trap.

The pendulum had swung to its opposite. A soul that starved itself would become one that drowned in sensation. The hermit's denial bred the courtier's indulgence.

But indulgence could become its own cage. Attachment to beauty. Craving for sensation. The inability to find stillness in a world designed to overwhelm the senses. The endless, exhausting performance of feeling everything correctly.

She watched him move through corridors she would need to learn. Watched him compose a verse on morning light with the particular concentration of someone whose worth was measured in such compositions. Watched the way his attention caught on textures, colors, the line of someone's neck—surfaces that would never release him.

This was where she could work.

Different approaches had failed. Force created suffering that clarified rather than corrupted. Circumstance manipulation created mirrors that revealed rather than concealed. Even success backfired—every intervention accelerating rather than impeding.

But there was something else emerging. Her powers were growing. The arc from observation to remote influence to circumstance manipulation continued its trajectory. Soon she might do more than watch, more than nudge through intermediaries.

She noted the change. Filed it for later examination.

Soon she might become truly present in the past. Soon the distance between them might collapse entirely.

She withdrew from the light tracking. The Heian thread hummed at the edge of perception, waiting for her to return with purpose.

Manchester's lights scattered across the rain-wet streets below, visible now as she opened her eyes: this city, this moment, this body that sat in a corner of a flat while her consciousness reached across centuries.

The rehearsal dinner felt distant now. Dr. Pierce, with her certainty and her loneliness, belonged to a different order of concern. Nadia, practicing the chill bride act. Mother and Jeff, performing their careful humility.

Everyone performing. Everyone reaching for something they wouldn't name.

Including her.

But she didn't think that last part. Not quite. Not in words that would require examination.

The Heian thread waited. The next configuration. The next opportunity.

She rose, finally, from her corner. Her legs had stiffened from hours of stillness, and she moved toward the window with the deliberate care of someone relearning their body's ordinary negotiations with space.

Outside, a car passed on wet streets. A door slammed somewhere in the building below. The city continued its night-time rhythms, indifferent to the woman watching from her window who had just travelled across centuries without moving.

The headache had receded to a dull presence rather than a pulse. Her hands had stopped trembling.

These costs—she noted them without concern. Powers had costs. Abilities exacted prices. This was how it had always been, for her kind, in her work.

The Heian thread would require new strategies. New approaches. The soul she was tracking had just reorganized itself around hunger, and she would need to understand what hunger did to someone surrounded by everything they once denied themselves.

She made a mental note. Closed the tracking for tonight.

Tomorrow would bring clinical work. Patients. The ordinary architecture.

And behind it all, the extraordinary reach that was slowly becoming her defining purpose.
