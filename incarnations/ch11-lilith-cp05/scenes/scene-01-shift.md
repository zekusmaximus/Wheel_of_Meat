The ink faded first.

Rome's particular density, papyrus and bronze and the weight of accumulating contradictions, thinned and opened into something else. Sand, stone, and an emptiness so complete it registered as texture. The procedural rhythm of investigation gave way to a stillness she could feel pressing against her awareness like held breath. Heat replaced the brazier's controlled warmth, not the fever-heat of Athens's plague but something drier, more deliberate. Sun cooking stone that had been cooking for decades, for centuries, for as long as men had chosen to suffer here and called the suffering holy.

In her flat, the transition registered as absence of absence. The contradictions she had carried from Verinus's thread released her, and what replaced them was simpler. Emptier. A single thread humming in a silence so deep she could taste it.

She opened her eyes. Manchester held its particular stillness. The radiator ticking, the rain having stopped at some point she could not identify, the tea beside her laptop no longer cold but crystallized, abandoned so long the liquid had begun to evaporate. How many days since Rome? She should know. She documented everything.

But the documentation mattered less now than it had. The tracking consumed documentation. The tracking *was* documentation.

The new thread pressed against her awareness, and she leaned toward it.

Different from Verinus. Different from any of them. This consciousness carried weight that took her time to name, it was sparse, deliberate, stripped of everything she had learned to expect from the avatars she tracked. No procedure. No calculation. No reaching for knowledge or companions or meat hoarded against winter. This one had chosen to hold still. This one had chosen to contain himself in a space so small that stillness was the only option remaining.

*Macarius.*

Heat arrived before image. The pressure of Egyptian midday, thick and visible, shimmering off sand in waves that made the horizon uncertain. She felt the weight of it settling on shoulders that had borne it for fifteen years. She felt the particular numbing of sustained exposure, the way the body stopped registering what it could not escape.

She was observing him in his cell. Four paces by three. Reed mat for sleeping, water jug for thirst, rough wooden cross for focus. Palm fronds piled in the corner, the material for his daily work: split, twist, weave, pull tight. Baskets accumulating in the space beneath the window, the evidence of years of discipline, of a routine so ingrained it had become invisible to the man who performed it.

His hands moved through the weaving with the attention of someone who had made thousands of baskets and would make thousands more. The rhythm was meditative, or it was meant to be. But she could feel something else beneath the motion. It was a precision that served a purpose the baskets did not require.

*He cannot abide stillness. The weaving is his anchor.*

The recognition surfaced with clarity that felt almost like looking in a mirror. She filed the observation without examining why. Numerous iterations now. Ka hoarding certainty in meat. Chandra hoarding certainty in outcomes. Philon hoarding certainty in teaching. Verinus hoarding certainty in precision. Now this: a man who hoarded certainty in discipline itself, in the performance of renunciation, in the structure of a life so stripped that stripping had become its own accumulation.

In her flat, her own hands rested motionless in her lap. The tracking posture she had maintained for—how long? Hours? Days? Her stillness matched his stillness, though his contained palm fibers and hers contained nothing but watching. She did not notice the parallel. She was too busy observing his.

The thread deepened. She followed him through the morning prayers he spoke by rote. Beyond that she followed him through the silence between prayers that stretched and pressed, and finally to the moment when a young monk appeared in the doorway and waited for a word of wisdom that Macarius provided with careful economy.

*"When you find yourself weary, do not resist."*

The advice landed in the young monk like rain on parched stone. Gratitude flooding features too open for desert life. And Macarius felt something stir beneath his weathered surface. Something warm. Something that spread through his chest with a pleasure he would never name.

She recognized the warmth.

Philon had carried it when students gathered around him in the agora. Chandra had carried it when the Emperor's ministers sought his counsel. The satisfaction of being needed, of having words that mattered, of holding what others lacked.

*He is nearer than I expected.*

The observation filed itself with the others. She leaned closer, feeling the shape of where to press. This consciousness was different from Verinus's. It was austere where Verinus had been procedural, contained where Verinus had been investigative. However, the vulnerability was the same. A man whose virtue was performance. A man who had built his holiness on the audience watching it.

She could work with that.

The radiator in her flat had gone cold, or perhaps had always been cold. She could not remember when she had last adjusted it, or eaten, or spoken to anyone whose voice existed in the present rather than echoing through millennia. The flat held shapes that matched the cell. Stripped walls, minimal furniture, a stillness that had grown so complete she no longer registered she was maintaining it.

*Another structure,* she observed. *Different shape. Same attachment.*

The phrase formed itself with the clarity of certainty. This was familiar now: the recognition of a pattern, the identification of an intervention point, the confidence that she saw what the avatar could not see about himself.

She did not notice that understanding the pattern had become its own attachment. She was already leaning deeper into the thread, already feeling for the pressure points, already certain not just observation but *presence* would be required for this intervention to succeed.

The palm fiber split under Macarius's practiced hands. In Manchester, her own hands remained motionless.

Both of them were holding themselves in containments they called holy, and neither of them saw the bars.
