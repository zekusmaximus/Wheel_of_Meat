# Scene III: Professional Life

The letter arrived in the internal mail on a Tuesday, tucked between a journal article she'd requested and a reminder about mandatory training. Official NHS letterhead, formal language, the particular bureaucratic weight of processes completed.

*Following investigation of the complaint filed by Mr. Luther Crane, the panel has concluded that Dr. Azami's clinical judgment was sound and documentation thorough. No further action required.*

Lilith read it once, filed it in the appropriate folder, and turned to her morning case notes. The process was finished. The complaint had never troubled her sleep—she had been right, and documentation had proven it, and now the institution had confirmed what she had known from the beginning.

"Luther thing finally put to bed?" 

Dr. Chen stood in her doorway, steaming cup in hand, the particular warmth of someone who made colleagues feel looked after. He had stopped by to check on her twice during the review, small kindnesses that cost him nothing and meant enough.

"Officially closed," Lilith said.

"Must be a relief."

"It was never in doubt."

Chen's eyebrows rose fractionally—the smallest registration of surprise at her certainty—before his expression smoothed into its customary ease. "Well. That's one way to look at it." He raised his cup in a small salute and continued down the corridor.

Lilith returned to her notes. The morning held two patient sessions and a case conference; by the time she emerged for coffee, the Luther matter had retreated to its proper place among things concluded.

The encounter happened in the corridor outside the consultants' meeting room. Dr. Harrow—grey-haired, perpetually creased, his disapproval having softened since the complaint review into something closer to professional neutrality. He had been on the panel, surprisingly fair in his assessment. Lilith had updated her mental file: more complex than the category she'd assigned.

"Dr. Azami." He paused, hands occupied with a stack of folders. "The Morrison case—your read on the risk profile?"

She gave her assessment in the clipped, precise register they used for clinical matters. Harrow nodded, made a note on the topmost folder with a movement that suggested he was actually listening rather than waiting for her to finish.

"Thank you." He continued toward his office without unnecessary conversation.

Lilith watched him go. Interesting, the way people could revise themselves—could exceed the limitations of their own consistent behavior. Harrow had been filed under *departmental obstacle, manages anxiety through control*, and he had been that, and he had also been something else during the review. Fairness that contradicted the file.

She made a mental note: recalibrations were possible. People could surprise.

She did not make the corresponding note: that she had never recalibrated her assessment of the man she'd been tracking for four years. That some files remained sealed regardless of evidence.

The afternoon brought a case conference that ran long, a discussion of medication protocols that required more of her attention than she had available. Twice she found her thoughts drifting—to the cell in the desert, to the death she had witnessed and was still processing, to the thread she had glimpsed extending forward into silk and incense and colors she couldn't yet name.

"Dr. Azami?"

She looked up. Dr. Winters was waiting for a response, her expression carrying the particular patience of someone repeating themselves.

"Sorry. Long night." Lilith pulled the relevant file closer, scanned for context. "The titration schedule—yes, I agree with the conservative approach."

Winters nodded, moved on. But Lilith caught the glance that passed between two colleagues at the far end of the table. A look that said *she's been off lately* without requiring words.

After the meeting, washing her hands in the bathroom, she caught her reflection: slightly paler than usual, shadows under the eyes she hadn't noticed gathering. The face of someone spending nights in places that left their mark.

She dried her hands. Made a mental note to improve her sleep hygiene. Returned to her office.

The afternoon continued with the particular rhythm of clinical days—one patient responding well to treatment, another regressing into patterns she'd hoped were resolving, the endless documentation that kept the machinery running. She needed coffee by three, which was unusual. The mug she filled was larger than her typical afternoon cup.

At five-fifteen, preparing to leave, she almost called a patient by the wrong name. The error caught in her throat, redirected at the last moment—"Mr. Davies, yes, we'll schedule that follow-up"—but she felt it there, the slip that almost happened.

These were not crises. They were not even problems. They were the beginning of a pattern that would deepen over the coming years: the slight erosion of attention, the small professional costs of a mind increasingly occupied elsewhere.

*Colleagues notice preoccupation.*

She gathered her things. The tracking was calling, had been calling since morning, the patient gravitational pull of something that mattered more than the day's careful maintenance.

The evening waited with its notebooks, its threads, its questions that would not resolve themselves. Macarius was dead in his desert cell, reaching toward color with hands that had forgotten how to receive it. The Heian world shimmered at the edge of perception, ready to unfold.

She locked her office door. Walked toward the exit with the ground-covering stride of someone whose real work was elsewhere.

The headache arrived somewhere around the car park—a pulse at her temples that she attributed to screen time, to the fluorescent lights of the meeting room, to anything except the nights spent reaching through time toward lives that were not her own.

She drove home through Manchester's gathering evening. The sky held the particular grey of northern cities in uncertain seasons, clouds that could not decide between rain and restraint.

Tomorrow would bring more patients, more documentation, more of the professional architecture that allowed her other work to continue unnoticed.

Tonight, there was tracking to do.
