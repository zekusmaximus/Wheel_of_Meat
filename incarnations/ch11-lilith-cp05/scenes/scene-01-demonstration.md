# Scene I: The Demonstration Session

The afternoon light entered Lilith's office in measured slants, filtered through blinds she never fully opened. The room held the particular stillness of spaces designed for revelation—neutral walls, two chairs angled toward each other, the desk positioned to suggest equality rather than authority. On its surface: a closed file from her morning patient, a glass of water she had not touched, and the shadow of her hand as she made a small note.

The woman across from her sat with the rigidity of someone who had stopped trying to appear comfortable. Dr. Eleanor Pierce—early fifties, philosophy faculty at the university—wore her graying hair pulled back with a severity that suggested she had forgotten it was there. Her glasses caught the light when she moved, which was rarely. The knuckles of her right hand showed white against the armrest.

"I was right," Pierce said. The words arrived with the weight of a verdict long rendered. "That's what makes this unbearable. I was demonstrably, provably correct."

Lilith let the statement settle. Outside, somewhere distant, a door closed.

"Tell me about being correct."

Pierce exhaled—not quite a laugh. "The curriculum committee. Eighteen months of meetings, of gathering evidence, of building the case for what anyone with sense could see. Our methodology was outdated by a decade. Students were learning frameworks that had been superseded before they were born." Her voice carried the careful articulation of someone accustomed to lecture halls. "I compiled the research. Every study, every shift in the field. I brought it to the committee, and I watched them not it."

"Not it?"

"Acknowledge it without acting. That particular academic ritual." Pierce's mouth tightened. "So I stopped being polite. I built coalitions. I forced votes. I made it impossible for them to keep pretending the emperor was clothed."

"And the curriculum changed."

"The curriculum changed." Pierce's hands had moved to her lap, fingers interlaced now with the precision of someone holding themselves together. "And somehow that's not the end of it. Somehow I'm here, in this chair, because my colleagues won't look at me in meetings. Because junior faculty change direction when they see me in the corridor. Because my doctoral student—my best student—transferred to another supervisor last month and couldn't quite meet my eyes when she told me why."

The silence stretched. Lilith observed the way Pierce's jaw worked, the small movements of containment.

"What did she say? When she told you why."

"Something diplomatic. Something about fit." Pierce's voice had thinned. "But I heard what she meant. That I would fight for her the same way I fought for the curriculum. That being around me meant being around conflict. That being right—" She stopped. Swallowed. "That being right isn't the same as being safe."

Lilith turned her pen once, slowly. "When you think about being right—in your body, not your argument—what does that feel like?"

Pierce blinked. The question had landed somewhere she hadn't defended.

"I don't understand."

"You've described what you knew, what you proved, what you won. I'm asking about what it felt like. The certainty. The campaign. The winning."

Pierce's gaze went to the window, to the measured light. Her shoulders held a tension that had calcified into posture.

"Necessary," she said finally. "It felt necessary."

"And now? Sitting alone at meetings. Watching colleagues avoid you. The student who couldn't stay."

"Also necessary." But the word came slower. Pierce's fingers had separated, found each other again, separated. "Someone had to see that it changed. Someone had to care more about being right than being liked."

"Did you?"

"What?"

"Care more about being right than being liked."

Pierce's face did something complicated—a movement that started as indignation and softened into something else before arriving at her eyes as a kind of blankness.

"I didn't think it was a choice."

Lilith waited. The building's ventilation hummed at the edge of hearing. In the corridor outside, footsteps passed and faded.

"What did you have to let go of," she asked, "to hold onto being correct?"

Pierce sat very still. Her fingers had stopped their movements.

"Everything, apparently." The word carried the particular rawness of something realized rather than recited. "I let go of everything."

"You won the argument." Lilith kept her voice even, a surface without current. "What else was available, in that moment, besides winning?"

"I don't—" Pierce pressed her glasses higher with a gesture that seemed mechanical, a routine emptied of meaning. "There wasn't anything else. Just the argument. Just being right."

"Sometimes the need to be right is itself the attachment." Lilith spoke carefully, placing each word. "Not the position. The *need*."

Pierce's eyes focused, sharpened with something that looked like objection gathering for articulation.

"So I should have let them be wrong? Let students suffer through a broken curriculum for the comfort of my colleagues?"

"There's a difference between trusting your judgment and needing to crush what challenges it." The words came, and as they did, something flickered in Lilith's attention—a half-recognition, a shape in peripheral vision that vanished when she turned toward it. "One is wisdom. The other is—" She paused. Her gaze had gone briefly unfocused, as if she were listening to something in her own voice. "—something else."

Pierce did not understand. The exchange closed with the usual professionalism, the scheduling of a follow-up, the handshake that carried more formality than warmth. Pierce left, her carriage unchanged, still armored in the righteousness that had cost her everything and protected her from knowing it.

The door clicked shut.

Lilith returned to her desk, completed her session notes with the efficiency of long practice. *Dr. Pierce presents with interpersonal isolation secondary to conflict patterns in professional setting. Core wound: identity fusion with correctness. Recommended continued exploration of relational vs. evidentiary models of truth.* 

The words came easily. The analysis was sound.

She filed the notes, and her attention shifted—had already been shifting, if she were honest—toward the other work. The tracking materials waited in her flat, patient as she was not. The patterns she had been following for four years, through lives she had witnessed and interventions she had shaped.

The woman in the desert. The hermit's pride in new clothing.

She gathered her things, checked the time. The rehearsal dinner was in three hours.

Somewhere beneath her awareness, the parallel went unexamined: Pierce, so certain she was right that she had forgone everything for that certainty. Lilith, making notes in a closed file, already planning her next intervention with the same conviction.

She would not see it. She was not looking.

The afternoon light continued its slant across the empty office, finding no one to observe where it fell.
