# Scene III: The Feeding

---

Days passed. She remained.

The interviews took longer than the delegation had planned. Theophanes's questions multiplied—the regimen of prayer, the nature of temptation, the relationship between body and spirit that the desert fathers had cultivated through decades of deprivation. Macarius answered each question with the careful economy of a man who had chosen his words for fifteen years and saw no reason to spend them recklessly now.

And with each answer, his spine straightened a degree.

She felt the shift first as posture—the subtle adjustment of a body that believed it was demonstrating humility while performing something else. His chin lifted when the scribes' styluses scratched across wax tablets. His voice found a register he had not used in months, perhaps years: the teaching voice, the voice that knew how to land words where they would be recorded.

*He is warming to this.*

The observation arrived with the clarity she had cultivated across four iterations. Ka warming to the meat he would not share. Chandra warming to the counsel that made him indispensable. Philon warming to the students who gathered in the plague-stink to hear him teach. Verinus warming to the cases where his precision proved correct.

The warmth was always the same. The warmth was always fatal.

In her flat—no, in the Theodora-body she inhabited—she felt his pleasure register as physical sensation. Not her pleasure. His. But the body translated it anyway: the spreading heat through the chest, the loosening of tension she had not known she was holding, the satisfaction of being needed.

*The vessel is affecting perception,* she filed. *Prolonged manifestation creates noise.*

She did not examine why the noise felt familiar.

The interviews continued. Theophanes asked about the temptation of despair—how did one maintain faith when the desert offered nothing but silence and one's own failing body? Macarius's answer came with a practiced fluency that betrayed its performance:

*"The silence is not empty. The silence is God's voice learning to speak through the absence of lesser sounds."*

The scribes wrote furiously. The elderly priest nodded with visible reverence. And Macarius felt the warmth intensify—the rancid-honey taste of wanting to be heard, wanting to be written, wanting his words to outlast his weathered body and speak to generations of monks he would never meet.

Theodora stood against the wall and watched.

She had been standing for hours. The position should have become unbearable—mortal bodies required movement, required adjustment, required the basic maintenance of muscles that cramped and joints that stiffened. But her stillness matched his stillness. Her containment echoed his containment. And something in that echo felt not uncomfortable but correct.

*Two bodies practiced at not-moving.* The observation surfaced without examination. *Two consciousness choosing containment.*

She guided Theophanes's next question with a whisper of attention—not speaking, not interfering, only shifting his awareness toward the inquiry she needed:

*"Your humility is remarkable. How do you maintain such purity of devotion?"*

The words arrived in Theophanes's mouth as if he had thought of them himself. He spoke them with the gravity of genuine curiosity. And Macarius—

Macarius's hands trembled.

Just for a moment. A flutter she would have missed if she had not been watching with the attention of a body that was also a consciousness threaded through time. His fingers, stilled from their eternal basket-weaving, twitched against the coarse fabric of his robe.

*He knows.* The recognition flashed. *Somewhere beneath the discipline, he knows what he is doing.*

But the knowledge did not surface. He answered the question with renewed humility—deflecting to God, to the saints who had guided him, to the brothers of Scetis whose example exceeded his own. The performance was flawless. And beneath the performance, the warmth continued to spread.

Days passed. The delegation extended their visit. There was more wisdom to record, more questions the faithful needed answered. Macarius obliged each request with the appropriate reluctance that was its own form of eagerness.

She remained.

In her flat—the awareness of it peripheral, ghostly, barely present—the light had shifted completely. The grey afternoon sat in the window like evidence of time she had not tracked. How many days? Manchester registered only as cold and stillness and the position she had maintained in her tracking corner. The Theodora-body was more real now than her own.

*Research requires proximity,* she repeated. *Thoroughness requires presence. Strategy demands extended observation.*

Each name was a wall. Each wall held back a recognition she would not examine:

She could not stop watching. She could not leave. Something in his stillness spoke to something in her stillness, and the speaking was not observation. The speaking was not strategic.

The speaking was a mirror.

She watched his performed humility and felt nothing that identified itself as recognition. She watched his attachment to renunciation—the way he had made holiness into a new form of grasping—and saw it with perfect clarity.

She did not see her own attachment to certainty, her own grasping at being the one who saw, the one who tracked, the one who would succeed where interventions had failed.

The mirror was everywhere. She kept her eyes on him.
