The monks assembled at dawn.

She stopped counting at fifty when the pattern became clear. They gathered in a natural depression between dunes, the sand shaped by wind into a crude amphitheater. The rising sun threw Macarius's shadow long across the assembled brothers, and somewhere in the crowd a young monk wept silently at the proximity of holiness.

She positioned herself at the back, half-hidden by the bulk of Theophanes. The Theodora-body maintained its perfect stillness. The scribes readied their tablets. And Macarius stood elevated on a flat stone, the sun behind him, the moment arranged for maximum impact.

*He knows how to work a stage.*

The observation arrived without judgment. Ka had known how to work a hunting ground, Philon how to work an agora, Verinus how to work a courtroom. Each soul she tracked had understood performance at some fundamental level. The settings changed. The skill persisted.

He opened his mouth to speak.

The words came with a fluency that betrayed preparation, though he would have called it inspiration. Renunciation, grasping, the nature of the self divided against itself—themes he had been rehearsing in interviews, ideas he had polished each time the scribes asked him to repeat. The speech flowed like water over stones worn smooth by years.

And she felt him *feeding*.

The warmth in his chest intensified with each attentive face. His voice found its rhythm. A rhythm of a rhetoric teacher, the rhythm of a man who had spent decades in classrooms before the desert claimed him. He had not forgotten how to hold an audience. He had only convinced himself that holding them for God was different from holding them for himself.

*The rancid-honey taste.* She could feel it on his tongue now, bleeding through the vessel's perception. The sweetness of attention. The sourness of wanting it too much. The particular flavor of gratification that had been building since the delegation arrived.

The speech continued. The monks absorbed every word. The scribes wrote without looking up.

And somewhere beneath her awareness, the moment she had been preparing arrived.

*Now.*

The mechanism was ready. Four lessons crystallized in his behavior—cooperation, generosity, wisdom, virtue—and this fifth flaw coiled around them all like a serpent around the staff of healing. The pride of renunciation. The grasping of ungrasping. She could inflate it until the structure collapsed.

She had been in the room for days. She had breathed the air he breathed, stood in a doorway that mirrored her flat's stripped containment. She had watched him not repeat the isolation, not repeat the distance, not repeat the martyrdom, not repeat the rigid certainty. Four lessons visible in a single man's behavior—more accumulated progress than she had seen in any iteration before.

And she had learned from Verinus: push the certainty until it becomes condemnation. From Macarius: feed the pride until it becomes visible. The near-miss in the tribunal had shown her—she had been *close*. Verinus's certainty had aligned toward condemning the innocent, and only Philo's hands had broken through. She would not repeat that mistake. She would push harder. Seal the recognition before it could form.

The moment was perfect. Fifty monks gathered. Scribes recording. The warmth in his chest building toward unbearable.

*Push. Now. End this.*

Her will moved toward the amplification—the muscles in Theodora's back went rigid—

And the Theodora-body did not follow.

Three breaths. Five heartbeats. She was frozen in the vessel, awareness straining against flesh that would not move. The mechanism was ready. The intervention was poised. And something in the meat she was wearing *refused*.

*Push,* she told herself. *This is the moment.*

But the body held.

The body, the meat—it was stupid, mortal, limited. It held back when her consciousness demanded action. She could feel the stillness in it, the same stillness she had admired in Macarius, the same stillness she had cultivated in her flat without examining why.

But this body had been *present*. This body had stood in his cell for days, watching him not repeat their mistakes. This body had seen the four lessons crystallized into behavior before she could observe him struggling. This body had breathed the same air as a consciousness approaching something she could not name.

And this body refused.

*Body-knowledge,* she filed. *Vessel-noise. Strategic recalibration required.*

The rationalizations stacked themselves like bricks. The hesitation remained beneath them, unexplained.

Three breaths. Five heartbeats. And then—

Macarius stopped speaking.

His voice faltered mid-sentence, the fluent rhythm breaking against something internal. His eyes widened slightly. It was a flicker she might have missed from distance but could not miss through the body she inhabited. His hands, which had been gesturing with the practiced grace of an orator, began to tremble.

*He tastes it.*

The rancid-honey flavor was overwhelming now. She could feel the recognition of what he was doing flooding his awareness. Why he was doing it, the warmth in his chest having nothing to do with God and everything to do with being *seen*.

The monks waited. The silence stretched. The sun pressed down.

And Macarius recognized the structure of his own vanity.

It did not come as thought, thought would have taken too long. It came as body-knowledge, the same body-knowledge that had made her hesitate. His posture collapsed inward. His chin, which had been lifted toward divine inspiration, dropped toward his chest. The trembling spread from his hands to his arms to his shoulders, and what had been performance became—

Something real. Something broken. Something that looked, impossibly, like the beginning of genuine humility.

The monks interpreted the silence as holy wisdom. The scribes paused, waiting for the next pearl to fall. Only she saw what was actually happening: the fifteen years of accumulated vanity crumbling under its own weight.

She had intended corruption. She had received revelation.

A smile crossed the Theodora-face—brief, involuntary. Satisfaction at the intervention's success. But beneath the satisfaction, something else moved. Something that felt more like recognition than triumph.

She withdrew from the vessel as the dissolution continued. The Theodora-body flickered and was gone. The monks too focused on Macarius's strange silence to notice one dignitary fewer among them. Manchester reasserted itself: the cold flat, the crystallized tea, the tracking posture she had maintained for how long, how long, how long—

The question surfaced before she could suppress it:

*Why did I hesitate?*
