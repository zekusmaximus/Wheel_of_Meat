# Scene IV: The Gathering

---

The monks assembled at dawn.

Fifty of them, perhaps more—she stopped counting when the pattern became clear. They gathered in a natural depression between dunes, the sand shaped by wind into a crude amphitheater. The rising sun threw Macarius's shadow long across the assembled brothers, and somewhere in the crowd a young monk wept silently at the proximity of holiness.

She positioned herself at the back, half-hidden by the bulk of Theophanes. The Theodora-body maintained its perfect stillness. The scribes readied their tablets. And Macarius stood elevated on a flat stone, the sun behind him, the moment arranged for maximum impact.

*He knows how to work a stage.*

The observation arrived without judgment—Ka had known how to work a hunting ground, Philon how to work an agora, Verinus how to work a courtroom. Each soul she tracked had understood performance at some fundamental level. The settings changed. The skill persisted.

He opened his mouth to speak.

The words came with a fluency that betrayed preparation, though he would have called it inspiration. Renunciation, grasping, the nature of the self divided against itself—themes he had been rehearsing in interviews, ideas he had polished each time the scribes asked him to repeat. The speech flowed like water over stones worn smooth by years.

And she felt him *feeding*.

The warmth in his chest intensified with each attentive face. His voice found its rhythm—the rhythm of a rhetoric teacher, the rhythm of a man who had spent decades in classrooms before the desert claimed him. He had not forgotten how to hold an audience. He had only convinced himself that holding them for God was different from holding them for himself.

*The rancid-honey taste.* She could feel it on his tongue now, bleeding through the vessel's perception. The sweetness of attention. The sourness of wanting it too much. The particular flavor of gratification that had been building since the delegation arrived.

The speech continued. The monks absorbed every word. The scribes wrote without looking up.

And somewhere beneath her awareness, the moment she had been preparing arrived.

*Now.*

The mechanism was ready. She could amplify his pride to the breaking point—push the warmth higher, make the gratification unbearable, shatter his composure until his hypocrisy was visible to everyone gathered in the sand. The delegation would witness the collapse. The scribes would record not wisdom but vanity. Macarius would be exposed, disgraced, his fifteen years of discipline revealed as the elaborate performance it had always been.

*Push. Now. End this.*

The intention formed with crystalline clarity. She had shaped it across days of observation, hours of subtle guidance, the patient construction of conditions that would maximize the intervention's impact. This was the moment. This was precision.

Her will moved toward the amplification—

And the Theodora-body did not follow.

Three breaths. Five heartbeats. She was frozen in the vessel, awareness straining against flesh that would not move. The mechanism was ready. The intervention was poised. And something in the meat she was wearing *refused*.

*Push,* she told herself. *This is the moment.*

But the body held.

The body—stupid, mortal, limited—held back when her consciousness demanded action. She could feel the stillness in it, the same stillness she had admired in Macarius, the same stillness she had cultivated in her flat without examining why. The body knew something she could not parse. The body was speaking a language she had forgotten.

*Strategic patience,* she filed desperately. *Optimal timing. The intervention will be more effective if the recognition comes from within.*

The rationalizations stacked themselves like bricks. The hesitation remained beneath them, unexplained.

Three breaths. Five heartbeats. And then—

Macarius stopped speaking.

His voice faltered mid-sentence, the fluent rhythm breaking against something internal. His eyes widened slightly—a flicker she might have missed from distance but could not miss through the body she inhabited. His hands, which had been gesturing with the practiced grace of an orator, began to tremble.

*He tastes it.*

The rancid-honey flavor was overwhelming now. She could feel it flooding his awareness—the recognition of what he was doing, of why he was doing it, of the warmth in his chest that had nothing to do with God and everything to do with being *seen*.

The monks waited. The silence stretched. The sun pressed down.

And Macarius recognized the structure of his own vanity.

It did not come as thought—thought would have taken too long. It came as body-knowledge, the same body-knowledge that had made her hesitate. His posture collapsed inward. His chin, which had been lifted toward divine inspiration, dropped toward his chest. The trembling spread from his hands to his arms to his shoulders, and what had been performance became—

Something real. Something broken. Something that looked, impossibly, like the beginning of genuine humility.

The monks interpreted the silence as holy wisdom. The scribes paused, waiting for the next pearl to fall. Only she saw what was actually happening: the fifteen years of accumulated vanity crumbling under its own weight.

She had intended corruption. She had received revelation.

A smile crossed the Theodora-face—brief, involuntary. Satisfaction at the intervention's success. But beneath the satisfaction, something else moved. Something that felt more like recognition than triumph.

She withdrew from the vessel as the dissolution continued. The Theodora-body flickered and was gone—the monks too focused on Macarius's strange silence to notice one dignitary fewer among them. Manchester reasserted itself: the cold flat, the crystallized tea, the tracking posture she had maintained for how long, how long, how long—

The question surfaced before she could suppress it:

*Why did I hesitate?*
