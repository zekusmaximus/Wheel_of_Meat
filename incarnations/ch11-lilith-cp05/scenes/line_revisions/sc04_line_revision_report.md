## Executive Summary

This 80-line climactic scene depicts the gathering and Lilith's hesitation. **Critical: loaded gesture at 12.5%**. The body-refusal is thematically powerful but the scene lacks embodiment. **Overall revision priority: Major**.

## 2. Voice Pattern Compliance

| Pattern | Target | Actual | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Sensory Anchoring | 75% | ~50% | ⚠ BELOW |
| Loaded Gesture | 40% | **12.5%** | ❌ CRITICAL |
| Environmental Metaphor | 50% | ~40% | ⚠ BELOW |
| Parallel Construction | 20% | ✓ | ✓ PASS |

### Critical Deficit

The scene's central irony—body wisdom vs. consciousness—is undermined by lack of physical grounding. The hesitation moment needs MORE body, not less.

## 3. Priority Line Revisions

### LINE 35-43: Hesitation Sequence (Preserve core, enhance body)

**Current:**
> "And the Theodora-body did not follow.
> Three breaths. Five heartbeats. She was frozen in the vessel..."

**Assessment:** This IS loaded gesture—but isolated. **Add physical sensation BEFORE the refusal.**

**Suggested L33 addition:**
> "Her will moved toward the amplification—the muscles in Theodora's back went rigid—"

---

### LINE 63: Body-Knowledge (Preserve)

**Current:**
> "It came as body-knowledge, the same body-knowledge that had made her hesitate."

**Assessment:** Crucial thematic link. **Preserve.**

---

### LINE 77: Key Question (Preserve)

**Current:**
> "*Why did I hesitate?*"

**Assessment:** Chapter question. Threads forward. **Preserve exactly.**
