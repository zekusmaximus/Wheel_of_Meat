## Executive Summary

This 68-line scene develops the "rancid-honey" warmth motif. Loaded gesture at **14.7%**—critical deficit. The mirror metaphor lands well but Lilith's body vanishes. **Overall revision priority: Major**.

## 2. Voice Pattern Compliance

| Pattern | Target | Actual | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Sensory Anchoring | 75% | ~60% | ⚠ BELOW |
| Loaded Gesture | 40% | **14.7%** | ❌ CRITICAL |
| Environmental Metaphor | 50% | ~45% | ⚠ BORDERLINE |
| Parallel Construction | 20% | ✓ | ✓ PASS |

### Critical Gesture Deficit

**Pure interiority throughout:** Most of scene is observation of Macarius without Theodora-body grounding.

**Add gesture to:**
- L15: "she felt his pleasure register"—add body response
- L21-25: Interview content—add physical cost
- L45-47: "Days passed"—add deterioration signs

### LINE 63-65: Mirror Closure (Preserve)

**Current:**

**Assessment:** Ironic blindness perfectly rendered. **Preserve.**
