## 4. Priority Line Revisions

### LINE 21-23: Perfect Embodiment (Preserve)

**Current:**
> "She had been pure awareness for weeks, consciousness threaded through time, and now she was meat again.
> The meat noticed things."

**Assessment:** Title theme embodied. **Do not alter.**

---

### LINE 47-49: Cell/Flat Mirror (Preserve)

**Current:**
> "Body-knowledge rather than thought. A recognition that bypassed the cosmic frame: she had been here before. The *structure* rather than the cell or century.
> Her flat. This cell. The shape was hers."

**Assessment:** Critical parallel. **Preserve exactly.**
