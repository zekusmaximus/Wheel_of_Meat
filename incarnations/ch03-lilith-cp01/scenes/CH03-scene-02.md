## II

Ka did not know the word for what he was doing. The concept of *hoarding* would not exist for epochs, would require granaries and ledgers and the slow accumulation of surplus beyond immediate need. But his body knew. His hands knew, the way they clutched the frozen deer haunch, the way his fingers curled around it even in sleep.

*Mine.*

The word pulsed through the cave, through time, through the flat where Lilith's own hands had tightened around her mug without her noticing.

*Mine. Mine. Mine.*

She watched him drag the kill to his separate cave. Higher than the tribe's shelter, colder, but his own. The meat was heavy. His shoulders burned with the carrying of it. But the burning was good, was proof, was the feeling of having what others did not have.

The tribe's fire smoked in the valley below. She saw them as Ka saw them: not individuals but a single organism, a rival claim on the resources he had taken. They passed food hand to hand down there. They slept in piles like wolves, breath mixing in the dark. The cubs got first bite now—new thing, strange thing, wrong thing.

Ka had rejected this. Ka had chosen the cave and the cold and the certainty that his meat belonged to him.

Lilith's hands wrapped tighter around the mug's cooling ceramic. She understood the logic. She could trace it as clearly as she might trace a patient's defenses, the way each choice led to the next, the way the ice wall in his chest had grown from protection to prison without his noticing. He had been hurt by the tribe—she could feel the old wound in his side, the memory of the alpha male's teeth, the others turning away. He had learned that alone was safe. He had learned that keeping was survival.

The lesson was wrong. She could see that clearly. His isolation would kill him more surely than any predator. His hoarding would leave him with meat he could not eat while his body failed in the cold.

She could see it. She lacked the ability to reach through time to change it. The skill would come later, but she could see the pattern of his mistake as clearly as if she were reading his chart.

*Such a long way to go,* she thought. *Hundreds of lifetimes, maybe.*

Her tea had gone cold. She drank it anyway, the bitterness appropriate, while Ka gnawed on meat that was beginning to turn, and both of them sat in their caves, hers heated by radiator, his by embers that would gutter before dawn. They both chose to stay.

Ka was calculating how long this flesh would last if eaten slowly, if hidden from others who might smell it, if the alone-way proved stronger than the together-way. His fingers, blackening now at the tips, though he remained unaware, curled tighter around the haunch.

Lilith was calculating too. How far did this thread extend? How many iterations had this consciousness accumulated? What was it building toward, and how long until it arrived?

She called this curiosity. She called this research.

The words were comfortable. The words were wrong.

Ka heard a sound. The soft pad of feet on stone, the whisper of small-fast-prey that had smelled his hidden meat. He bared his teeth at the darkness. The meat was his. He had killed for it. He had carried it. He had chosen cold and solitude to keep it.

*Mine.*

Lilith's phone buzzed with a text from the department, a reminder about tomorrow's case conference, the ordinary machinery of a life she was forgetting to live. She did not look at it. She did not move from her corner, her watching-place, her cave.

*Mine,* the thread whispered. Hers now, this pattern she had found. This puzzle she would solve.

The small-fast-prey retreated from Ka's teeth. In Manchester, the phone stopped buzzing. In both times, silence settled back over the watchers, and neither of them noticed how alike their watching had become.

For an instant she wasn't sure whether the meat was frozen or the tea was cold, whether the cave was hers or the flat was his, whether the isolation she was observing was happening to her or—

She lost the thought before it finished. She returned to observation. Filed the slippage under fatigue. Did not look at it again.

She could reach out now. The capacity was there. Not to change what had already happened, but to *sense* more deeply, to trace the thread forward through whatever deaths and rebirths waited between this cave and the present day. She had the skill. She had refined it over fifteen years of following her own patterns through parish records and ship manifests and the peculiar déjà vu of standing in places her current body had never visited.

But she did not reach. Not yet.

Instead she watched. And watching, she told herself, was not the same as grasping. Watching was neutral. Watching was research.

The words were comfortable. The words were wrong.

Ka's fire had guttered to embers. The cold was seeping deeper now, through hide and flesh and into the bone. He clutched his meat and did not feel his fingers failing. He had what he wanted. He was winning.

Lilith's radiator clicked off, the cheap flat's inadequate heating cycling down for the night. The cold crept in through walls that had never been properly insulated. She did not move to find a blanket. She had what she wanted. She was learning.

Both of them held their prizes and called it enough.
