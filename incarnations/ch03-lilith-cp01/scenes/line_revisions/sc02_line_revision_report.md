# Editorial Review: The Hoarding

## Scene: `scene-02-hoarding.md`

---

## Executive Summary

This 62-line scene powerfully develops the Ka/Lilith parallel structure. The mirroring technique ("Both of them held their prizes and called it enough") is the scene's greatest strength. Technical polish is needed: em-dash overuse and pronoun density. **Overall revision priority: Moderate**.

## 1. Technical Issues (Punctuation Audit)

| Line | Issue | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| **27** | Em-dash overuse (2×) | "His fingers—blackening now at the tips, though he remained unaware—curled tighter around the haunch." |
| **27** | Conjunction start | Sentence context flagged |

**Total issues: 3** (1 conjunction start, 2 em-dash instances)

### Recommendations

**Line 27**: The parenthetical about blackening fingers is crucial—consider comma set:
> "His fingers, blackening now at the tips though he remained unaware, curled tighter around the haunch."

## 2. Clarity Issues (Pronoun Audit)

**Summary**: 24 total issues

| Category | Count | Priority |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Ambiguous Pronouns | 19 | MEDIUM |
| Pronoun Starts | 5 | LOW |

### HIGH-Priority Flags

**Line 3**: Multiple entities (Ka, concept, body, hands) with rapid pronoun shifts
- *Context*: "Ka did not know... The concept... But his body knew. His hands knew..."
- *Assessment*: Pronouns anchored by possessives—**RETAIN**

**Line 45**: Pronoun ambiguity in temporal blurring passage
- *Current*: "she wasn't sure whether the meat was frozen or the tea was cold, whether the cave was hers or the flat was his"
- *Assessment*: Deliberate confusion serves theme—**RETAIN**

### Pattern Note

The scene deliberately blurs Ka/Lilith through pronoun proximity—this is the temporal integration technique working correctly. Most "ambiguous pronoun" flags are false positives.

## 3. Voice Pattern Compliance

| Pattern | Target | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Sensory Anchoring | 75% | ✓ Strong |
| Loaded Gesture | 40% | ⚠ ~32% |
| Environmental Metaphor | 50% | ✓ Strong |
| Parallel Construction | 20% | ✓ Strong |

### Loaded Gesture Analysis

**Present examples:**
- L3: "hands clutched the frozen deer haunch, fingers curled around it even in sleep"
- L7: "Lilith's own hands had tightened around her mug without her noticing"
- L57: "He clutched his meat and did not feel his fingers failing"

**Below-threshold paragraphs (add gesture):**
- L17: Lilith's analysis paragraph—no physical grounding
- L29: Lilith's calculations—pure interiority

**Suggested enhancement (L17):**
> *Current*: "Lilith understood the logic. She could trace it as clearly as..."
> *Revised*: "Lilith's jaw tightened. She understood the logic. She could trace it as clearly as..."

## 4. Priority Line Revisions

### LINE 17: Add Loaded Gesture

**Current:**
> "Lilith understood the logic. She could trace it as clearly as she might trace a patient's defenses..."

**Suggested Revision:**
> "Lilith's hands wrapped tighter around the mug's cooling ceramic. She understood the logic. She could trace it as clearly as she might trace a patient's defenses..."

**Rationale:** Mirrors Ka's clutching; physical grounding before interiority.

---

### LINE 31-33: Strengthen Parallel

**Current:**
> "She called this curiosity. She called this research.
> The words were comfortable. The words were wrong."

**Assessment:** Excellent as-is. No change needed.

---

### LINE 45-47: Preserve Deliberate Confusion

**Current:**
> "For an instant she wasn't sure whether the meat was frozen or the tea was cold, whether the cave was hers or the flat was his..."

**Assessment:** The pronoun ambiguity here is the point—Lilith's observer position is collapsing. **RETAIN**.

---

### LINE 55: Echo Structure

**Current:**
> "The words were comfortable. The words were wrong."

**Assessment:** Perfect parallel echo from L33. Key structural beat—**do not alter**.

## 5. Summary Assessment

| Dimension | Rating |
|-----------|--------|
| Voice Consistency | Strong |
| Technical Polish | Needs Work |
| Thematic Depth | Rich |
| **Revision Priority** | **Moderate** |

### Highest-Impact Revisions
1. Add loaded gesture to L17
2. Address em-dash in L27
3. Consider gesture in L29

### Strengths to Preserve
- "Both of them held their prizes and called it enough" (L61)
- The repeated "words were comfortable/wrong" motif
- Ka's fingers blackening while Lilith's tea goes cold
