## IV

The gap was the hardest part.

She had learned this from her own iterations: the space between death and rebirth resisted observation. It was not a place exactly, not a time, but something else—a state that language could only approximate. The pattern existed there without existing, persisted without persisting, carried forward by forces she could describe but not explain.

Ka's thread entered the gap and she almost lost it—the cold sensation vanishing, the sense of ancient depth collapsing into formlessness. For a long moment she drifted in something that was neither dark nor light, neither here nor elsewhere.

Then coherence returned.

Warmth. The warmth of enclosure, of flesh pressed against flesh, of a rhythm that was not her own heartbeat but surrounded it, contained it, gave it context. The pattern had found new conditions. The hunger for understanding had drawn it forward, seeking what it needed to learn.

*India.*

The knowing arrived the way such knowings always did, from nowhere and everywhere at once. The pattern had anchored in a place that would not be called India for millennia yet, in a time of empires and administrators, of ledgers and grain and the careful accounting of suffering. She could sense the shape of the society forming around the forming body: structured, hierarchical, concerned with duty and commerce and the proper ordering of human affairs.

*Chandra.*

The name surfaced from the thread itself, from the pattern's own becoming. A merchant's son. An administrator in an empire that measured everything except what mattered. Still learning what Ka had died needing to learn. Still working at the lesson of giving.

The thread extended further—she could feel it, the long chain of lives stretching forward through time, each one carrying the hunger that had survived the cave. But the strain was building behind her eyes, the cost of sustained tracking making itself known. She could not hold this perception indefinitely.

She withdrew carefully, following her own thread back to the body waiting in Manchester, the cold flat and the empty mug and the radiator that had long since stopped pretending to heat.

Morning light was beginning to gray the window. She had been gone for hours.

Lilith stood on legs that did not quite feel like her own. Crossed to the kitchen. Drank water directly from the tap, something she never did, a small rebellion against the exhaustion that wanted to claim her.

She had done it. The technique worked on others the way it worked on herself. She could track a consciousness through death to rebirth, could follow the thread of becoming from ancient cave to empire to—

To where?

The question sat in her chest like the cold that had not quite left. This pattern she had found—Ka, Chandra, whoever came after—it was still out there. Still accumulating. Still burning with the hunger to understand what it had failed to understand in that freezing cave.

*Where is it now?*

Dawn light strengthened. Manchester stirred toward morning outside her window: buses beginning their routes, early joggers on the paths, the ordinary machinery of a world that did not know it contained such things as she had seen tonight.

She would follow this one forward. The decision felt inevitable, the way certain clinical interventions felt inevitable—not forced but discovered, the right action emerging from the correct assessment. See where it went. Understand what it was becoming.

A fellow traveler. That was all. Curiosity about a parallel journey. The scientist's desire to understand a phenomenon she had stumbled upon.

*That was all.*

The phrase felt thin even as she thought it. There was more beneath, something she was not ready to examine—a pull that went beyond curiosity, a resonance she could not name. But naming could wait. For now she had proven a technique. Tomorrow—today, really, the morning already here—she would begin to use it.

She turned from the window. The flat held its ordinary shapes: furniture and books and the detritus of a carefully constructed life. Behind it all, the thread hummed at the edge of her perception, waiting to be followed.

Lilith did not sleep. She made fresh tea instead, watching the leaves bloom in hot water, and she did not think about blood in snow, or frozen hands, or the desperate hunger that had survived the death of the body.

She thought about the thread. About where it led. About the consciousness still out there, still learning, still burning toward something she could almost see.

A problem to solve. That was what she had found.

She would solve it.
