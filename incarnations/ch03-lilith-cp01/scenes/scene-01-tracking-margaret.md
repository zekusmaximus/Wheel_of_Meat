The M62 stretched gray and slick beneath the wipers, their rhythm metronomic against the February rain. Lilith kept her hands at ten and two, knuckles white beneath the dashboard glow, while the chemical tang of the Widnes refineries seeped through the vents. The radio offered Debussy, something from the *Arabesques*, but the notes dissolved into the hiss of tires on wet tarmac before reaching her.

Three hours of driving. Four of sitting in a car park outside a terraced house in Headingley, watching condensation bloom on the windshield while a family ate their Sunday roast behind lit windows.

The toddler had appeared briefly—carried past the front window, small fists beating against her father's shoulder. Dark hair, like Margaret's. The same slight asymmetry in the earlobes that Margaret had fingered constantly during their sessions, a self-soothing gesture that had survived the crossing.

Lilith's notebook lay open on the passenger seat. Fifteen years of entries filled the pages behind today's date: her own iterations catalogued in cramped handwriting, verified against parish records and ship manifests and the peculiar déjà vu of standing in places her current body had never visited. The physician in Alexandria. The sutler following Wellington's army through Spain. A washerwoman in Guangzhou whose memories surfaced only in the smell of lye.

Her own pattern, confirmed and reconfirmed until the doubt receded to a dull background hum.

But Margaret was not her own pattern.

Margaret Chen had been a referral from oncology—depression secondary to terminal diagnosis, the paperwork said, though what Lilith found in their sessions ran deeper than situational grief. Margaret had spoken of lives before this one with the calm certainty of someone describing last Tuesday. The medical establishment had other words for such claims. Lilith had kept her face professionally neutral while her pulse quickened beneath the sleeve of her white coat.

When Margaret died in October, Lilith had waited. Tracked the obituary, the cremation, the slow fade of a consciousness from hospital room to wherever consciousness went. Then she had done something she did not understand: she had reached for the thread of Margaret's pattern the way she reached for her own memories, and she had found it.

Not in the past. In the present.

In Leeds. In a toddler with dark hair and asymmetrical ears.

The notebook remained open. Lilith had driven here to confirm what she already knew, and confirmation had come in the small fists, the familiar gesture of touching an ear, the pattern settling into new flesh like water finding its level.

*Others.*

The word formed without sound. Her own iterations were strange enough—but they were *hers*, explicable as some quirk of her particular consciousness. This was different. This meant the phenomenon was not anomaly but law. Not personal haunting but universal mechanics.

She pulled away from the kerb as the streetlights flickered on. The family inside would never know why a strange woman had spent the afternoon watching their home. Lilith did not fully know herself. Only that the thread she'd followed to this place was real, and that she could follow others now, and that the ground beneath her understanding of the world had shifted in a way she could not name.

The M62 unspooled westward through the dark. Manchester waited with its rain and its lectures and its carefully documented life. But something had opened in her, some new capacity for seeing, and Lilith could not tell whether the sensation in her chest was discovery or hunger or both.
