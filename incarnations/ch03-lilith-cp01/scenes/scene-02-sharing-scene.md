The seminar room smelled of instant coffee and damp wool, nineteen bodies pressed too close in a space built for twelve. February had turned the windows opaque with condensation, and the fluorescent tubes buzzed their migraine frequency overhead. Lilith arrived to find every chair occupied, the doctoral students arranged in territorial clusters around Dr. Harrow's favoured position near the radiator.

Priya Sharma was the last to enter—first-year, still learning the department's unspoken hierarchies, her messenger bag catching on the door frame as she scanned the room for a seat that did not exist. Her shoulders drew in, a physical contraction that Lilith recognized from a hundred intake sessions.

Lilith stood before she had consciously decided to move. "Here." She gathered her own bag and notepad from the chair, stepped into the narrow space between Priya and the wall.

"No, I couldn't—"

"I've been sitting all morning." The lie came easily, as lies about her body usually did. She had run six miles before dawn, her joints loose and warm. But Priya did not know that. Priya saw only the offered chair and the senior student's neutral smile.

The seminar began. Harrow's voice droned through attachment theory and the neurochemistry of early bonding, none of it new. Lilith shifted her weight from left foot to right, feeling the familiar ache begin in her left knee—the one she had twisted badly in some previous configuration, though she could not always separate the injuries of this body from the phantom pains of others. The Crimean nurse had died of infected wounds; the memory lived in her like scar tissue, flaring in cold weather.

*The body was temporary.* The phrase arrived from nowhere and everywhere, settling into her like breath.

She let herself stand. Three hours would pass. Her knee would hurt tomorrow. Priya would take notes without noticing the small gift that had been given, and the gift would not diminish for the lack of acknowledgment.

Dr. Harrow was asking about the Strange Situation experiment, about secure attachment and avoidant patterns and the way early relationships shaped the architecture of expectation. Lilith listened with half her attention while the other half wandered toward the dark behind her eyes, the place where Margaret's thread had appeared, where other threads might wait to be found.

*If there are others,* she thought, *there must be many.*

The seminar ended. Students shuffled toward the door, their conversations already turning to weekend plans and overdue assignments. Priya passed Lilith with a quick nod—thanks offered and accepted, neither of them naming what had transpired. The small exchange of one body's comfort for another's, the kind of thing that cost little and echoed nowhere.

Lilith stayed to stack chairs, her hands busy while her mind worked at the larger question. Her own iterations, Margaret's, and now the suspicion that the threads extended further than she had imagined. The drive to Leeds had been an experiment. Tonight, alone in her flat, she would attempt something more ambitious.

The radiator clanked as it cooled. The fluorescent tubes hummed. Lilith carried the last chair to its stack and collected her bag, her body already anticipating the stillness that would come later, the practice she had never named and could not explain, the reaching toward something just beyond the edge of what she knew.
