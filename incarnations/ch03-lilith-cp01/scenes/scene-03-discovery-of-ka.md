The flat held the particular silence of late hours: the refrigerator cycling off, distant traffic reduced to a bass hum beneath the rain. Lilith had drawn the curtains against the streetlight's amber intrusion and lit a single lamp in the corner, its glow reaching just far enough to show the outline of her own crossed legs on the bare floor.

The tea on the side table had gone cold an hour ago. She did not remember making it.

The practice had no name she knew. As a child, she had called it "going back"—following the strange knowing that surfaced sometimes in dreams, the faces that felt familiar without ever being seen. At eight, she had told her mother about the physician in Alexandria with perfect certainty. At nine, she had stopped telling anyone anything.

The notebooks had begun at thirteen: meticulous records of what surfaced and how, cross-referenced against whatever historical details she could verify. A name appearing in a ship's manifest. A street layout matching her memory of a city she had never visited. Small confirmations accumulating into an architecture of understanding that she kept entirely private.

Tonight was different. Tonight she was not reaching for herself.

Her breath slowed. The room receded—not disappearing exactly, but becoming thin, less insistent. Behind her closed eyes, the familiar darkness of her own iterations waited: the nurse and the washerwoman and the physician, their patterns woven through centuries like threads in a tapestry she could only partially see. She let them pass without following.

*Others.*

The word was a direction now, a bearing she had discovered in following Margaret's thread. She turned toward it the way she might turn toward sound in a dark room—not with her body but with something beneath her body, the part of her that remembered lives this flesh had never lived.

At first, nothing. The darkness remained dark. Then—

A flicker. Not visual, exactly. More like the pressure change before a storm, the sense of something present just beyond perception. She moved toward it without moving, followed it without following, her attention sharpening on a thread that was distinctly not her own.

Ancient. The word arrived before understanding. The thread she had found was old in a way that made Margaret's pattern seem recent, old in a way that made her own iterations seem like yesterday. It receded into temporal depths she could not calculate, folding backward through time like a river viewed from above, its source hidden in distances that made her chest tighten.

She followed anyway.

The thread resolved slowly, coming into focus the way objects emerged from fog. She could feel its texture now: rough, unpolished, dense with something that was not quite memory and not quite identity but the place where those things met. A pattern being built. A consciousness accumulating. The slow accretion of whatever it was that survived the passage from one body to the next.

*Someone else was doing this work.*

The thought struck her with the force of revelation. Not alone. Not anomaly. Not the singular strangeness of her own impossible memory but evidence of a process larger than herself, a mechanism that operated regardless of whether she understood it.

She traced the thread forward, seeking its most recent configuration—

And the vision broke open like a wound.
