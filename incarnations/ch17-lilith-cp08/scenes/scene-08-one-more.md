Grey Manchester light filtered through curtains she had not opened in days.

The flat felt smaller than it was. Not physically, but perceptually. Walls pressing in. Space narrowing. The particular claustrophobia of strategies running out while the opponent's thread continued unspooling toward a threshold that admitted only one.

Lilith set down the cold tea she had been holding without drinking and poured a fresh cup. This one would also go cold. She knew this with the same certainty she knew Jean de Langon was dead and the lesson was learned and the backfire was complete.

Eight interventions. Eight structural failures.

Her fingers moved across laptop keys. The University of Manchester philosophy department page gave way to faculty listings. Course schedules. Campus maps showing buildings she had memorized without acknowledging why.

If historical interventions continued failing, if temporal distance was the wrong variable, then perhaps spatial proximity—

The thought completed itself before she could suppress it.

*What if I met him directly?*

Not as Marguerite or Sor Catalina or any of the vessels she had worn across centuries. Directly. In present time. In the same Manchester where his thread would eventually surface if she traced it forward through Wei Shufen's rebellion, through the noir detective's smoke-wreathed failure, through all the remaining lives she had yet to track.

Philosophy faculty. Contemporary ethics. The kind of institutional positioning a soul of his particular pattern might find comfortable.

She clicked through to individual profiles. Not identifying him yet—, for he did not know which face the consciousness wore now, but building the infrastructure to find out. Seminar schedules. Office hours. Department events open to external visitors.

Strategic preparation. Backup methodology. The contingency plans one maintained when historical approaches kept producing the same structural failure.

*One more. One more. One more.*

The rhythm pulsed beneath her awareness like a heartbeat she could not slow. Jean's method had failed. The intellectual approach had backfired exactly as the emotional approach had backfired exactly as every approach had backfired since she first pushed her awareness into Ka's prehistoric timeline.

But there had to be something. Some variable she was missing. Some refinement that would produce different results.

Wei Shufen's thread was already visible. the Taiping Rebellion, conviction sharp enough to die for, the question Jean had seeded finally finding its answer in 1862. She would track that next. One more historical intervention. One more attempt at correction.

And if that failed—

The campus maps remained open on her laptop. The faculty pages remained bookmarked. The research she insisted was backup planning sat visible on her screen like evidence of something she refused to examine.

The flat was too small. The methods were running out. The pull toward direct confrontation grew stronger with every backfire.

*One more. One more. One more.*

Grey light. Cold tea. The university page glowing with information she would use when she admitted to herself what she was already planning.

Already strategizing. Always strategizing. One more.

The wheel turned.
