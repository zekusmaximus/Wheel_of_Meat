# Scene 3: The Companionship

Candlelight caught the wine in Marguerite's cup—wrong temperature now, like the tea on Lilith's desk—as the philosophical conversation deepened toward its intended destination.

"The merchant saw Protestant riders," Jean said, and his voice carried the measured weight of a man presenting evidence for examination rather than conviction. "The farmer saw Catholic soldiers. The servant heard Protestant anger. Each testimony internally consistent. Each mutually exclusive."

"And you expect me to resolve this for you?" Marguerite's amusement was genuine. Lilith pushed the timing, the emphasis, but the words belonged to the widow. "I am a printer, Monsieur. I reproduce arguments. I do not settle them."

"But you understand the problem."

"I understand that human perception is unreliable, memory more so, and that interested parties construct narratives which serve their interests. Yes." Marguerite sipped her cold wine without grimacing. "I typeset these conclusions for Michel de Montaigne. I found them compelling then. I find them compelling now."

Jean's fingers touched in sequence—not counting evidence anymore, Lilith recognized, but counting philosophical positions. The gesture that should have warned him he was using intellectual tools on what had become an intellectual trap.

"Truth is hard to access," Jean said, as if testing the words.

"Testimony is unreliable," Marguerite agreed.

"If I cannot verify—"

"Then perhaps the honest position is to acknowledge that you cannot conclude."

*Perfect.* Lilith felt the progression building toward the endpoint she required: doubt total enough to prevent action, skepticism absolute enough to become paralysis dressed as principle. The arguments were working precisely as designed.

In Manchester, her fingers rested near laptop keys. The university website remained open—faculty listings, course schedules, the institutional architecture of modern intellectual life. Backup. Contingency. If temporal distance proved the wrong variable, then perhaps spatial proximity—

She cut off the thought before it completed. Historical method first. The approach was working. Jean was close to accepting that honest doubt meant honest inaction.

"If you cannot verify," Marguerite said—and the emphasis was Lilith's, the timing was Lilith's, though the conviction was purely Marguerite's own—"then you cannot conclude."

Jean touched his thumb to his index finger. The counting gesture that had become compulsion. Weighing the argument that would trap him.

He was close. The fortress walls were rising higher. Soon he would be safely sealed behind intellectual honesty so pure it became intellectual cowardice.

One more push. Just one more.
