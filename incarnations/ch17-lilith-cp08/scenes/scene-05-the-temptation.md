The print shop at midnight held the particular intimacy of shared skepticism: candlelight carving shadows from Marguerite's widow's peak, wine at wrong temperature, words that cut deeper for being spoken softly.

Jean had come to her—Lilith felt that satisfaction pulse through both timelines—had sought out philosophical conversation at an hour when most men sought only their beds. His fortress was crumbling. His tools had failed. All that remained was the final push toward paralysis.

"What if you submitted nothing?" Marguerite asked. Her voice—the widow's voice, genuine and measured—carried the argument Lilith had spent millennia refining. "What if you returned to the magistrate and said: the evidence is insufficient, the testimony contradictory, the truth inaccessible. I cannot in honesty conclude."

Jean set down his wine cup. His face held the particular stillness of a man confronting the logical endpoint of his own principles.

"That is surrender."

"Is it? Or is it the only honest response to a situation that permits no honest conclusion?"

Manchester receded to body-echo: grey light on closed eyelids, posture unchanged for hours, fingers resting near laptop keys that waited for the next round of research. Lilith's awareness narrowed to the print shop, to Marguerite's mouth forming the words, to Jean's resistance crumbling under the precision of his own doubt.

*This is it. He's going to accept. Submit nothing. The fortress will hold.*

"Consider," Marguerite continued, and the emphasis was Lilith's though the conviction was pure widow: "If you include the letter, you may be perpetuating a forgery. If you exclude it, you may be suppressing evidence. If you conclude Catholic guilt, you may be condemning innocent men. If you conclude Protestant conspiracy, you may be serving propaganda."

"So I conclude nothing."

"So you admit that some questions cannot be answered with the evidence available."

The argument was perfect. Lilith had built it from Montaigne's foundations and Pyrrhonist methodology, had tested its logic against every objection Jean de Langon might raise. It was genuinely compelling—which was the point. Jean was an intellectual. He would not surrender to crude manipulation. But he would surrender to arguments he could not refute because they were *true*.

And true they were. Testimony was unreliable. Memory reconstructed. Evidence could be forged. Every claim to certainty was suspect.

The trap's endpoint: perfect intellectual honesty that became perfect intellectual paralysis.

"You offer me purity," Jean said quietly. "The safety of perpetual suspension of judgment."

"I offer you honesty."

*Yes. Accept it. Understand that uncertainty is wisdom. Let the doubt hold you.*

Jean touched his fingers one final time. Thumb to index. The gesture that had been comfort, had been methodology, had been fortress wall.

Then he looked up.

And something in his face had changed.
