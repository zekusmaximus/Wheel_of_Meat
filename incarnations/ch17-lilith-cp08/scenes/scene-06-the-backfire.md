"You offer me a fortress," Jean said. "The same fortress I have inhabited my entire career."

The words landed like a blade finding gap between plates.

"The belief," he continued—and his voice had steadied, had found something beneath the doubt—"that uncertainty absolves me of responsibility for action."

Lilith felt the argument collapse. Not—No. The logic was perfect. The epistemology was sound. He could not refute it because it was *true*.

"But I can honestly describe what I found," Jean said. "Acknowledge what I could not verify. And let others judge whether incomplete findings serve truth better than complete silence."

Through Marguerite's eyes: shock. Through Marguerite's mouth: "And if you are wrong? If the letter is forged and you include it? If innocent men die?"

"Then I will have acted honestly about what I did not know." Jean gathered the letter back into his case. His hands were steady now, his posture certain in a way it had not been since the investigation began. "That is not the same as manufacturing false certainty. It is accepting that truthfulness does not require omniscience."

Manchester returned in a crash of sensation: her hands gripping the chair arms until her knuckles whitened, jaw clenched until teeth ached, the laptop glowing with a university page she had not meant to keep open. The flatness of her expression cracking into something she could not name and refused to examine.

No.

The method was sound. The timing was correct. The vessel was appropriate. Perhaps the emphasis needed adjustment. Perhaps the approach required refinement. Perhaps—

Jean was walking toward the door. Through Marguerite's awareness, Lilith watched him pause on the threshold.

"I thank you for the conversation," he said. "It has clarified my thinking remarkably."

Clarified. The intellectual precision that should have been hers, deployed against her own argument, turned upon the fortress she had tried to build around him.

"Has it?" Marguerite's voice followed him—the widow's bitterness, or perhaps something else that came from deeper. "Or has it merely given you permission to do what you already intended?"

"Perhaps both. Perhaps neither." Jean's smile was small, almost sad. "I find I have become comfortable with uncertainty about my own motives."

He left.

And in Manchester, Lilith sat in the grey light of almost-morning with stiff shoulders and a laptop screen and the recognition—filed immediately, suppressed ruthlessly—that eight interventions had produced eight backfires, and the pattern was structural.

The method was sound.

The method would work next time.

One more approach. There had to be one more approach.
