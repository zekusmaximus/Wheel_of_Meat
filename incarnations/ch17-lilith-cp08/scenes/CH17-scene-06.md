"You offer me a fortress," Jean said. "The same fortress I have inhabited my entire career."

The words landed like a blade finding gap between plates.

"The belief," he continued as his voice steadied, had found something beneath the doubt, "that uncertainty absolves me of responsibility for action."

Lilith felt the argument collapse. Not—No. The logic was perfect. The epistemology was sound. He could not refute it because it was *true*.

"But I can honestly describe what I found," Jean said. "Acknowledge what I could not verify. And let others judge whether incomplete findings serve truth better than complete silence."

Through Marguerite's eyes: shock. Through Marguerite's mouth: "And if you are wrong? If the letter is forged and you include it? If innocent men die?"

"Then I will have acted honestly about what I did not know." Jean gathered the letter back into his case. His hands were steady now, his posture certain in a way it had not been since the investigation began. "That is not the same as manufacturing false certainty. It is accepting that truthfulness does not require omniscience."

Through Marguerite's awareness—no, through something older—Lilith watched the moment crystallize.

The words had come before the reasoning. She had seen it. Felt it. The way he reached for something that should have been inaccessible—accumulated wisdom, earned across lifetimes, bleeding through.

*He's accessing it mid-life.*

The recognition hit her chest like cold water.

Every avatar before this one had learned their lesson in the dying. In the final moment when awareness thinned and accumulated lives could surface. Philon dying in the plague pit. Verinus choking on certainty. Diego releasing hatred as flames climbed his legs.

Jean de Langon had reached for it while still breathing. Still choosing. Still capable of action.

*The veil is thinning for him.*

Manchester returned in a crash of sensation: her hands gripping the chair arms until her knuckles whitened, jaw clenched until teeth ached, chest tight in a way she would not name. The laptop glowed with a university page she had not meant to keep open.

*He's approaching threshold. The accumulated lives are bleeding through.*

*I'm running out of time.*

No.

The method was sound. The timing was correct. The vessel was appropriate. Perhaps the emphasis needed adjustment. Perhaps the approach required refinement. Perhaps—

Jean was walking toward the door. Through Marguerite's awareness, Lilith watched him pause on the threshold.

"I thank you for the conversation," he said. "It has clarified my thinking remarkably."

Clarified. The intellectual precision that should have been hers, deployed against her own argument, turned upon the fortress she had tried to build around him.

"Has it?" Marguerite's voice followed him—the widow's bitterness, or perhaps something else that came from deeper. "Or has it merely given you permission to do what you already intended?"

"Perhaps both. Perhaps neither." Jean's smile was small, almost sad. "I find I have become comfortable with uncertainty about my own motives."

He left.

And in Manchester, Lilith sat in the grey light of almost-morning with stiff shoulders and a laptop screen and the recognition that all interventions had produced backfires, and the pattern was structural.

Jean had believed uncertainty absolved him of responsibility for action. She had watched him build that fortress stone by stone, question by question, until doubt became identity.

*He cannot stop questioning even when questioning serves paralysis.*

The observation arrived with the precision of diagnosis.

And beneath the observation, something she would not examine: *I cannot stop strategizing even when strategy produces backfire.*

The parallel pressed against walls that had no room for it.

His doubt in exchange for safety. Her precision in exchange for success. The same bargain wearing different forms. The same belief that systematic analysis would produce the outcome they required.

Jean's bargain had failed. His uncertainty had not protected him. Both factions would move against him for the report she had tried to prevent him submitting.

And her precision—

She filed the thought. Strategy did not require comparison.

The method was sound.

The method would work next time.

One more approach. There had to be one more approach.
