## 4. Summary Assessment

| Dimension | Rating |
|-----------|--------|
| Voice Consistency | **Weak** |
| Thematic Depth | **Exceptional** |
| **Revision Priority** | **Major** |

### Highest-Impact Revisions
1. Add 6-8 loaded gestures
2. Physical cost of "One more" compulsion

---

> **Chapter 17 Summary**: Consistent moderate gesture deficit (13-21%) except scenes 7-8 which are critical (<10%). The "One more" rhythm is exceptional. Jean's death scene and closing need major embodiment work.
