The letter appeared in Marguerite's archives the way evidence always appeared when Lilith directed an investigation's path: naturally, inevitably, as if the document had been waiting since 1588 to be found at precisely the moment that would do maximum damage.

She did not forge it. The letter was genuine—authentic Protestant correspondence, written by an angry commander to a moderate he considered traitor. The signature was illegible because the writer had made it illegible, had understood even in his fury that putting his name clearly to threats was unwise. The content was convenient because the content was *real*: there had been men who saw de Ségur as obstacle, who had discussed removing obstacles with the language men used when they meant violence.

Lilith's contribution was timing. Precision. The subtle push that sent Jean de Langon to the print shop on this day, directed him to this cabinet, made him open this folder at this moment.

"Nearly missed it," Marguerite murmured, and the words were her own—the widow's genuine observation at finding something misfiled. "Among other correspondence. The provenance is uncertain."

Jean's hands closed around the document. Through Marguerite's eyes, Lilith watched his face change: the careful neutrality cracking, the fortress shaking. Evidence that could resolve his investigation. Evidence he could not verify.

The perfect trap.

In Manchester, Lilith switched between browser tabs without examining why the university faculty page remained open. The rain had stopped—or had it? She could not say when. Jaw tight. Shoulders held with precision that matched Jean's finger-touching sequence—both of them measuring, weighing, certain that systematic analysis would produce the conclusion they required.

The letter established Protestant conspiracy. If genuine. If included in the report.

The letter was masterful fabrication. If forged. If used as weapon.

Jean could not determine which it was. That was the point. The genuine ambiguity of a genuine document, amplified by timing until it became paralysis.

"May I take this?" Jean asked, and his voice had lost the measured confidence Lilith associated with professional investigators. He sounded like a man realizing his tools did not reach the truth they were meant to grasp.

"It is evidence," Marguerite said. "I assume you have authority."

He folded the letter carefully. His fingers touched in sequence: thumb to index, index to middle, middle to ring. Counting possibilities. Measuring absence.

Lilith felt the certainty crystallize: *This will work. The letter's ambiguity will paralyze him. One more push and—*

Something flickered. The thought did not complete. A question she had not meant to ask: *Will this actually work?*

She filed it under strategic assessment and continued positioning the trap.
