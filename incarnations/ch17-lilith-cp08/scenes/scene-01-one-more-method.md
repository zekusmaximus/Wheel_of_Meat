One more method, and the fortress would fall.

Her tea had gone cold three hours ago. Lilith did not pour a fresh cup. She would pour a fresh cup, eventually, but only when the tracking cycle demanded she anchor herself in Manchester's physical present long enough to feel her own fingers against ceramic. Fut for now however, the cold was appropriate. The cold matched the calculation. The cold matched the precision she was about to deploy.

On the laptop screen, the University of Manchester philosophy department homepage glowed in her peripheral vision. She had not clicked through to the faculty pages. Not yet. That was backup, contingency, the strategic preparation one maintained while historical methods still offered promise.

The question was doubt in two registers.

In Renaissance France, a man touched his thumb to his index finge in a counting gesture, a weighing gesture, the pattern she recognized from Diego's physician hands and Verinus's investigating patience. Jean de Langon examined witness testimony that could not be reconciled, and his doubt was professional, earned, the intellectual armor of a man who had survived by refusing to commit.

In Manchester, Lilith examined the backfire that had been Sor Catalina. Emotional manipulation. Personal betrayal. Diego de Lucena watching his friend Tomás embrace hatred, and instead of hardening he had released the hatred. Let it go. Learned the lesson she had tried to prevent him learning.

Different method. More precise. Targeted.

Jean de Langon used doubt as fortress. She could feel the architecture in his finger-touching sequence, the way each counted possibility became another stone in walls he had built around himself. Professional neutrality. Careful suspension of judgment. The belief that uncertainty absolved him of responsibility for action.

She knew this fortress. She had watched Verinus construct something similar from Stoic principles. She had seen it in every avatar who preferred the safety of withdrawal to the risk of commitment.

And she knew how to bring it down.

Not emotional manipulation—that had failed with Sor Catalina's zealotry, had backfired into mercy rather than resistance. Jean was not driven by passion. Jean was driven by precision.

So precision would be the weapon.

The philosophy department page still glowed. Lilith did not glance at it. The laptop was simply there waiting, the way the letter in Marguerite's archives was waiting, the way the widow's measured skepticism was waiting, the way all the instruments of intellectual seduction were waiting for her to deploy them.

One more method. Intellectual approach for intellectual fortress.

This one would work.
