The road west of Bordeaux ran through oak forest thick enough to swallow sound, and Jean de Langon died there in the gathering dark.

Lilith watched through temporal perception, not through Marguerite's eyes. The widow had served her purpose and was left behind in her print shop, setting type for pamphlets that would not change the world. Through something older, something that preceded vessels and names and individual faces. Through the awareness that had tracked him since Ka crouched in firelight three hundred thousand years before.

Six riders emerged from the trees. Catholic and Protestant working together, united only in their need to punish the man who had refused to serve either narrative.

Jean's sword cleared its scabbard in the same motion she had seen from Diego's physician hands, from Verinus's investigating patience, from every avatar who understood that defense was sometimes necessary and survival was not guaranteed. He fought. His shoulder, the old wound, she knew its history across bodies, betrayed him. His horse fell. And still he fought.

Not well enough.

A blade took him in the side. Another found his throat.

And in the last bleeding moments, Jean de Langon looked at the stars beginning to show between clouds and said what would matter: "I told the truth about what I didn't know. That was mine to give."

Tightness in Lilith's chest. She refused to name it.

He was dying for honest uncertainty. For the report he had submitted despite knowing it would satisfy no one. For the choice she had tried to prevent him making and had only made more pure by her opposition.

The lesson crystallized bright and terrible in his fading awareness: *If I can die for honest uncertainty, what can I die for with conviction?*

Hunger. The familiar hunger that preceded transition, that pulled consciousness toward its next expression. Not backward into the life that was ending, but forward into something else. Somewhere ahead—a different century, a different cause—that question would find its answer.

Manchester crept back around her: grey light, stiff limbs, the laptop still glowing with faculty pages she had not meant to keep open. Jean's body lay on a French road four hundred years in the past. Her body sat in a Fallowfield flat surrounded by the evidence of failed precision.

The precision itself had created the friction that forged his breakthrough.

A pull in her chest she could not afford to call grief drew her toward him. Toward continuing. Toward *what?*

The race. The stakes. Strategic necessity.

She filed the sensation.

*Why am I still trying?*

The thought surfaced before she could suppress it. Emotional manipulation had failed—Sor Catalina's backfire still fresh. Intellectual precision had failed—Jean's breakthrough still visible on that French road. The pattern was structural. Every intervention accelerated what she opposed.

Any reasonable assessment would conclude: abandon historical intervention. The methodology itself was flawed.

But she was already planning the next method. Already cycling through possibilities. Already reaching for one more.

The persistence exceeded any rational justification for continuing.

Something in her chest that had nothing to do with strategy. Nothing to do with the race. Nothing to do with winning. A pull that exceeded any rational calculation for why she should continue.

She filed the observation and did not examine what it meant.

She reached for the laptop.
