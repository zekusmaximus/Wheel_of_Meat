One more method, and the fortress would fall.

Her tea had gone cold three hours ago. Lilith did not pour a fresh cup. She would pour a fresh cup, eventually, but only when the tracking cycle demanded she anchor herself in Manchester's physical present long enough to feel her own fingers against ceramic. Fut for now however, the cold was appropriate. The cold matched the calculation. The cold matched the precision she was about to deploy.

On the laptop screen, the University of Manchester philosophy department homepage glowed in her peripheral vision. She had not clicked through to the faculty pages. Not yet. That was backup, contingency, the strategic preparation one maintained while historical methods still offered promise.

The question was doubt in two registers.

In Renaissance France, a man touched his thumb to his index finge in a counting gesture, a weighing gesture, the pattern she recognized from Diego's physician hands and Verinus's investigating patience. Jean de Langon examined witness testimony that could not be reconciled, and his doubt was professional, earned, the intellectual armor of a man who had survived by refusing to commit.

In Manchester, Lilith examined the backfire that had been Sor Catalina. Emotional manipulation. Personal betrayal. Diego de Lucena watching his friend Tomás embrace hatred, and instead of hardening he had released the hatred. Let it go. Learned the lesson she had tried to prevent him learning.

Different method. More precise. Targeted.

But first, what she observed.

The thread carried Jean's signature, and the signature confirmed what should have been impossible. Not one lesson integrated. Not two. Every pattern she had tracked across millennia, crystallized into behavior before she could observe him struggling with the flaw.

He moved within the Parlement's investigative framework without competition—consulted witnesses, deferred to evidence, shared findings openly. Ka's isolation was absent. When he examined testimony, he gave equal attention regardless of station—a servant's account weighed against a merchant's, presence offered freely without calculation. Chandra's ledger-mind had dissolved.

And there: the diagnostic clarity. She watched him recognize the political trap embedded in his assignment without losing himself in despair. Philon's wisdom intact—the capacity to see systems while remaining within them. He maintained ethical standards despite faction pressure, didn't flee into collaboration or partisan conclusion. Verinus's rigid certainty absent—he acted virtuously without waiting for procedure to guarantee the outcome.

Macarius's performance had dissolved. This one held genuine uncertainty, not tactical neutrality. No holy doubt that needed witness. Kaoru's grasping had released—he accepted professional mortality without attachment, held the investigation without freezing it.

And—

Her hands registered warmth they shouldn't. Manchester crept in: her fingers against cold ceramic, her jaw tightening.

He doubted without bitterness. Questioned without resentment. The capacity to endure uncertainty without hatred.

Diego's patience.

But she had broken Diego. Had watched him experience specific, personal hatred toward the man who betrayed him. Had seen accumulated progress shatter under her intervention, watched the flames climb his legs while his face twisted with the ill-will she had cultivated.

Except the lesson had formed anyway. Through endurance of destruction, not triumph. Patience crystallizing in the crucible of total loss.

Her "success" had been no success at all.

Seven patterns, integrated into behavior before she could observe him struggling with them.

The observation she filed was larger than any she had filed before. Larger than tactical. Larger than strategic. The soul approaching something she would not name.

One more method. This one would work.

The thought arrived with a certainty that tightened her shoulders. She filed it as confidence.

Jean de Langon used doubt as fortress. She could feel the architecture in his finger-touching sequence, the way each counted possibility became another stone in walls he had built around himself. Professional neutrality. Careful suspension of judgment. The belief that uncertainty absolved him of responsibility for action.

She knew this fortress. She had watched Verinus construct something similar from Stoic principles. She had seen it in every avatar who preferred the safety of withdrawal to the risk of commitment.

And she knew how to bring it down.

Not emotional manipulation—that had failed with Sor Catalina's zealotry, had backfired into mercy rather than resistance. Jean was not driven by passion. Jean was driven by precision.

So precision would be the weapon.

The philosophy department page still glowed. Lilith did not glance at it. The laptop was simply there waiting, the way the letter in Marguerite's archives was waiting, the way the widow's measured skepticism was waiting, the way all the instruments of intellectual seduction were waiting for her to deploy them.

One more method. Intellectual approach for intellectual fortress.

This one would work.
