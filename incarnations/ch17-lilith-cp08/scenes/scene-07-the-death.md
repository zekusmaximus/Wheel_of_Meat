# Scene 7: The Death

The road west of Bordeaux ran through oak forest thick enough to swallow sound, and Jean de Langon died there in the gathering dark.

Lilith watched through temporal perception—not through Marguerite's eyes now; the widow had served her purpose and was left behind in her print shop, setting type for pamphlets that would not change the world. Through something older, something that preceded vessels and names and individual faces. Through the awareness that had tracked him since Ka crouched in firelight three hundred thousand years before.

Six riders emerged from the trees. Catholic and Protestant working together, united only in their need to punish the man who had refused to serve either narrative.

Jean's sword cleared its scabbard in the same motion she had seen from Diego's physician hands, from Verinus's investigating patience, from every avatar who understood that defense was sometimes necessary and survival was not guaranteed. He fought. His shoulder—old wound, she knew its history across bodies—betrayed him. His horse fell. And still he fought.

Not well enough.

A blade took him in the side. Another found his throat.

And in the last bleeding moments, Jean de Langon looked at the stars beginning to show between clouds and said what would matter: "I told the truth about what I didn't know. That was mine to give."

Something tightened in Lilith's chest that she refused to name.

He was dying for honest uncertainty. For the report he had submitted despite knowing it would satisfy no one. For the choice she had tried to prevent him making—and had only made more pure by her opposition.

The lesson crystallized bright and terrible in his fading awareness: *If I can die for honest uncertainty, what can I die for with conviction?*

Hunger. The familiar hunger that preceded karmic transition, that pulled consciousness toward its next expression. Not backward into the life that was ending, but forward into something else. Somewhere ahead—a different century, a different cause—that question would find its answer.

Manchester crept back around her: grey light, cold tea, the laptop still glowing with faculty pages she had not meant to keep open. Jean's body lay on a French road four hundred years in the past. Her body sat in a Fallowfield flat surrounded by the evidence of failed precision.

Eight interventions. Eight backfires.

The precision itself had created the friction that forged his breakthrough.

Something in her chest—not grief, she could not afford grief—pulled toward him. Toward continuing. Toward *what?*

The race. The stakes. Strategic necessity.

She filed the sensation and reached for the laptop.
