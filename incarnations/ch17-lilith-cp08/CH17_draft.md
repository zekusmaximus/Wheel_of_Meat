One more method, and the fortress would fall.

Her tea had gone cold three hours ago. Lilith did not pour a fresh cup. She would pour a fresh cup, eventually, but only when the tracking cycle demanded she anchor herself in Manchester's physical present long enough to feel her own fingers against ceramic. Fut for now however, the cold was appropriate. The cold matched the calculation. The cold matched the precision she was about to deploy.

On the laptop screen, the University of Manchester philosophy department homepage glowed in her peripheral vision. She had not clicked through to the faculty pages. Not yet. That was backup, contingency, the strategic preparation one maintained while historical methods still offered promise.

The question was doubt in two registers.

In Renaissance France, a man touched his thumb to his index finge in a counting gesture, a weighing gesture, the pattern she recognized from Diego's physician hands and Verinus's investigating patience. Jean de Langon examined witness testimony that could not be reconciled, and his doubt was professional, earned, the intellectual armor of a man who had survived by refusing to commit.

In Manchester, Lilith examined the backfire that had been Sor Catalina. Emotional manipulation. Personal betrayal. Diego de Lucena watching his friend Tomás embrace hatred, and instead of hardening he had released the hatred. Let it go. Learned the lesson she had tried to prevent him learning.

Different method. More precise. Targeted.

But first, what she observed.

The thread carried Jean's signature, and the signature confirmed what should have been impossible. Not one lesson integrated. Not two. Every pattern she had tracked across millennia, crystallized into behavior before she could observe him struggling with the flaw.

He moved within the Parlement's investigative framework without competition—consulted witnesses, deferred to evidence, shared findings openly. Ka's isolation was absent. When he examined testimony, he gave equal attention regardless of station—a servant's account weighed against a merchant's, presence offered freely without calculation. Chandra's ledger-mind had dissolved.

And there: the diagnostic clarity. She watched him recognize the political trap embedded in his assignment without losing himself in despair. Philon's wisdom intact—the capacity to see systems while remaining within them. He maintained ethical standards despite faction pressure, didn't flee into collaboration or partisan conclusion. Verinus's rigid certainty absent—he acted virtuously without waiting for procedure to guarantee the outcome.

Macarius's performance had dissolved. This one held genuine uncertainty, not tactical neutrality. No holy doubt that needed witness. Kaoru's grasping had released—he accepted professional mortality without attachment, held the investigation without freezing it.

And—

Her hands registered warmth they shouldn't. Manchester crept in: her fingers against cold ceramic, her jaw tightening.

He doubted without bitterness. Questioned without resentment. The capacity to endure uncertainty without hatred.

Diego's patience.

But she had broken Diego. Had watched him experience specific, personal hatred toward the man who betrayed him. Had seen accumulated progress shatter under her intervention, watched the flames climb his legs while his face twisted with the ill-will she had cultivated.

Except the lesson had formed anyway. Through endurance of destruction, not triumph. Patience crystallizing in the crucible of total loss.

Her "success" had been no success at all.

Seven patterns, integrated into behavior before she could observe him struggling with them.

The observation she filed was larger than any she had filed before. Larger than tactical. Larger than strategic. The soul approaching something she would not name.

One more method. This one would work.

The thought arrived with a certainty that tightened her shoulders. She filed it as confidence.

Jean de Langon used doubt as fortress. She could feel the architecture in his finger-touching sequence, the way each counted possibility became another stone in walls he had built around himself. Professional neutrality. Careful suspension of judgment. The belief that uncertainty absolved him of responsibility for action.

She knew this fortress. She had watched Verinus construct something similar from Stoic principles. She had seen it in every avatar who preferred the safety of withdrawal to the risk of commitment.

And she knew how to bring it down.

Not emotional manipulation—that had failed with Sor Catalina's zealotry, had backfired into mercy rather than resistance. Jean was not driven by passion. Jean was driven by precision.

So precision would be the weapon.

The philosophy department page still glowed. Lilith did not glance at it. The laptop was simply there waiting, the way the letter in Marguerite's archives was waiting, the way the widow's measured skepticism was waiting, the way all the instruments of intellectual seduction were waiting for her to deploy them.

One more method. Intellectual approach for intellectual fortress.

This one would work.

The print shop smelled of ink and metal. Lilith felt both the chemical tang through Marguerite Viret's awareness and the cold lamp-glow through her own eyes in the Fallowfield flat. The same precision work: words arranged into meaning, letters set into type, arguments constructed with the care of someone who understood that each component bore weight.

Marguerite's face held the markers Lilith had worn in every life she could remember wearing faces at all: the widow's peak sharp and pronounced, the single darker strand falling forward over the left temple, the pale-green crescent in the iris of the left eye visible when candlelight struck at the right angle. The printer's widow was late thirties, educated, connected to the intellectual networks that survived between factions because skepticism served everyone's purpose equally.

And Marguerite genuinely believed what she was about to say.

That was the elegance of the method. Amplification rather than possession. Lilith never became the widow, never overrode her consciousness or spoke with her mouth as if puppeting empty flesh. She pushed *through*. Amplified what was already there. Marguerite Viret had typeset Montaigne's Essays letter by letter, had absorbed the arguments about the unreliability of testimony and the limitations of human knowledge simply by arranging the words across hundreds of pages. Her skepticism was earned. Her philosophy was genuinely hers.

Lilith simply ensured the philosophy reached its intended target.

*Now. Say this now. Push here.*

The words came from Marguerite's mouth with the conviction of decades: "I believe truth exists. I do not believe it can be reliably accessed through human testimony."

And in Manchester, Lilith felt the satisfaction of precision deployed. The arguments were working. Jean de Langon stood in the print shop with pamphlets in his hands and doubt in his posture, and he was *listening*. To ideas he had already considered, articulated by someone who voiced them better than he could voice them himself.

The seduction of being understood.

Cold tea on her desk. Cold metal type under Marguerite's fingers. Both women working with letters, with words, with the precise arrangement of meaning to produce specific effects.

The difference Lilith refused to consider was that Marguerite believed her arguments led toward truth, while Lilith knew they led toward paralysis.

Jean's finger-touching sequence began: thumb to index. Counting the possibilities. Weighing the implications.

Good. The trap was setting. The method was working.

One more push toward the fortress she would convince him was wisdom.

Candlelight caught the wine in Marguerite's cup. Wrong temperature now, like the grey light pooling unnoticed on her desk. The philosophical conversation deepened toward its intended destination.

"The merchant saw Protestant riders," Jean said, and his voice carried the measured weight of a man presenting evidence for examination rather than conviction. "The farmer saw Catholic soldiers. The servant heard Protestant anger. Each testimony internally consistent. Each mutually exclusive."

"And you expect me to resolve this for you?" Marguerite's amusement was genuine. Lilith pushed the timing, the emphasis, but the words belonged to the widow. "I am a printer, Monsieur. I reproduce arguments. I do not settle them."

"But you understand the problem."

"I understand that human perception is unreliable, memory more so, and that interested parties construct narratives which serve their interests. Yes." Marguerite sipped her cold wine without grimacing. "I typeset these conclusions for Michel de Montaigne. I found them compelling then. I find them compelling now."

Jean's fingers touched in sequence—not counting evidence anymore, Lilith recognized, but counting philosophical positions. The gesture that should have warned him he was using intellectual tools on what had become an intellectual trap.

"Truth is hard to access," Jean said, as if testing the words.

"Testimony is unreliable," Marguerite agreed.

"If I cannot verify—"

"Then perhaps the honest position is to acknowledge that you cannot conclude."

*Perfect.* Lilith felt the progression building toward the endpoint she required: doubt total enough to prevent action, skepticism absolute enough to become paralysis dressed as principle. The arguments were working precisely as designed.

In Manchester, her fingers rested near laptop keys. The university website remained open—faculty listings, course schedules, the institutional architecture of modern intellectual life. Backup. Contingency. If temporal distance proved the wrong variable, then perhaps spatial proximity—

She cut off the thought before it completed. Historical method first. The approach was working. Jean was close to accepting that honest doubt meant honest inaction.

"If you cannot verify," Marguerite said—and the emphasis was Lilith's, the timing was Lilith's, though the conviction was purely Marguerite's own—"then you cannot conclude."

Jean touched his thumb to his index finger. The counting gesture that had become compulsion. Weighing the argument that would trap him.

He was close. The fortress walls were rising higher. Soon he would be safely sealed behind intellectual honesty so pure it became intellectual cowardice.

One more push. Just one more.

The letter appeared in Marguerite's archives the way evidence always appeared when Lilith directed an investigation's path: naturally, inevitably, as if the document had been waiting since 1588 to be found at precisely the moment that would do maximum damage.

She did not forge it. The letter was genuine—authentic Protestant correspondence, written by an angry commander to a moderate he considered traitor. The signature was illegible because the writer had made it illegible, had understood even in his fury that putting his name clearly to threats was unwise. The content was convenient because the content was *real*: there had been men who saw de Ségur as obstacle, who had discussed removing obstacles with the language men used when they meant violence.

Lilith's contribution was timing. Precision. The subtle push that sent Jean de Langon to the print shop on this day, directed him to this cabinet, made him open this folder at this moment.

"Nearly missed it," Marguerite murmured, and the words were her own—the widow's genuine observation at finding a misfiled document. "Among other correspondence. The provenance is uncertain."

Jean's hands closed around the document. Through Marguerite's eyes, Lilith watched his face change: the careful neutrality cracking, the fortress shaking. Evidence that could resolve his investigation. Evidence he could not verify.

The perfect trap.

In Manchester, Lilith switched between browser tabs without examining why the university faculty page remained open. The rain had stopped—or had it? She could not say when. Jaw tight. Shoulders held with precision that matched Jean's finger-touching sequence. Both of them measuring, weighing, certain that systematic analysis would produce the conclusion they required.

The letter established Protestant conspiracy. If genuine. If included in the report.

The letter was masterful fabrication. If forged. If used as weapon.

Jean could not determine which it was. That was the point. The genuine ambiguity of a genuine document, amplified by timing until it became paralysis.

"May I take this?" Jean asked, and his voice had lost the measured confidence Lilith associated with professional investigators. He sounded like a man realizing his tools did not reach the truth they were meant to grasp.

"It is evidence," Marguerite said. "I assume you have authority."

He folded the letter carefully. His fingers touched in sequence: thumb to index, index to middle, middle to ring. Counting possibilities. Measuring absence.

Lilith felt certain: *This will work. The letter's ambiguity will paralyze him. One more push and—*

A flicker. The thought did not complete. A question she had not meant to ask: *Will this actually work?*

She filed it under strategic assessment and continued positioning the trap.

The print shop at midnight held the intimacy of shared skepticism: candlelight carving shadows from Marguerite's widow's peak, wine at wrong temperature, words that cut deeper for being spoken softly.

Jean had come to her. Lilith felt a satisfaction pulse through both timelines. Jean had sought out philosophical conversation at an hour when most men sought only their beds. His fortress was crumbling. His tools had failed. All that remained was the final push toward paralysis.

"What if you submitted nothing?" Marguerite asked. The widow's voice, genuine and measured, carried the argument Lilith had spent millennia refining. "What if you returned to the magistrate and said: the evidence is insufficient, the testimony contradictory, the truth inaccessible. I cannot in honesty conclude."

Jean set down his wine cup. His face held the stillness of a man confronting the logical endpoint of his own principles.

"That is surrender."

"Is it? Or is it the only honest response to a situation that permits no honest conclusion?"

Manchester receded to body-echo: grey light on closed eyelids, posture unchanged for hours, fingers resting near laptop keys that waited for the next round of research. Lilith's awareness narrowed to the print shop, to Marguerite's mouth forming the words, to Jean's resistance crumbling under the precision of his own doubt.

*This is it. He's going to accept. Submit nothing. The fortress will hold.*

"Consider," Marguerite continued, and the emphasis was Lilith's though the conviction was pure widow: "If you include the letter, you may be perpetuating a forgery. If you exclude it, you may be suppressing evidence. If you conclude Catholic guilt, you may be condemning innocent men. If you conclude Protestant conspiracy, you may be serving propaganda."

"So I conclude nothing."

"So you admit that some questions cannot be answered with the evidence available."

The argument was perfect. Lilith had built it from Montaigne's foundations and Pyrrhonist methodology, had tested its logic against every objection Jean de Langon might raise. It was genuinely compelling—which was the point. Jean was an intellectual. He would not surrender to crude manipulation. But he would surrender to arguments he could not refute because they were *true*.

And true they were. Testimony was unreliable. Memory reconstructed. Evidence could be forged. Every claim to certainty was suspect.

The trap's endpoint: perfect intellectual honesty that became perfect intellectual paralysis.

"You offer me purity," Jean said quietly. "The safety of perpetual suspension of judgment."

"I offer you honesty."

*Yes. Accept it. Understand that uncertainty is wisdom. Let the doubt hold you.*

Jean touched his fingers one final time. Thumb to index. The gesture that had been comfort, had been methodology, had been fortress wall.

Then he looked up.

And his face had changed.

"You offer me a fortress," Jean said. "The same fortress I have inhabited my entire career."

The words landed like a blade finding gap between plates.

"The belief," he continued as his voice steadied, had found something beneath the doubt, "that uncertainty absolves me of responsibility for action."

Lilith felt the argument collapse. Not—No. The logic was perfect. The epistemology was sound. He could not refute it because it was *true*.

"But I can honestly describe what I found," Jean said. "Acknowledge what I could not verify. And let others judge whether incomplete findings serve truth better than complete silence."

Through Marguerite's eyes: shock. Through Marguerite's mouth: "And if you are wrong? If the letter is forged and you include it? If innocent men die?"

"Then I will have acted honestly about what I did not know." Jean gathered the letter back into his case. His hands were steady now, his posture certain in a way it had not been since the investigation began. "That is not the same as manufacturing false certainty. It is accepting that truthfulness does not require omniscience."

Through Marguerite's awareness—no, through something older—Lilith watched the moment crystallize.

The words had come before the reasoning. She had seen it. Felt it. The way he reached for something that should have been inaccessible—accumulated wisdom, earned across lifetimes, bleeding through.

*He's accessing it mid-life.*

The recognition hit her chest like cold water.

Every avatar before this one had learned their lesson in the dying. In the final moment when awareness thinned and accumulated lives could surface. Philon dying in the plague pit. Verinus choking on certainty. Diego releasing hatred as flames climbed his legs.

Jean de Langon had reached for it while still breathing. Still choosing. Still capable of action.

*The veil is thinning for him.*

Manchester returned in a crash of sensation: her hands gripping the chair arms until her knuckles whitened, jaw clenched until teeth ached, chest tight in a way she would not name. The laptop glowed with a university page she had not meant to keep open.

*He's approaching threshold. The accumulated lives are bleeding through.*

*I'm running out of time.*

No.

The method was sound. The timing was correct. The vessel was appropriate. Perhaps the emphasis needed adjustment. Perhaps the approach required refinement. Perhaps—

Jean was walking toward the door. Through Marguerite's awareness, Lilith watched him pause on the threshold.

"I thank you for the conversation," he said. "It has clarified my thinking remarkably."

Clarified. The intellectual precision that should have been hers, deployed against her own argument, turned upon the fortress she had tried to build around him.

"Has it?" Marguerite's voice followed him—the widow's bitterness, or perhaps something else that came from deeper. "Or has it merely given you permission to do what you already intended?"

"Perhaps both. Perhaps neither." Jean's smile was small, almost sad. "I find I have become comfortable with uncertainty about my own motives."

He left.

And in Manchester, Lilith sat in the grey light of almost-morning with stiff shoulders and a laptop screen and the recognition that all interventions had produced backfires, and the pattern was structural.

Jean had believed uncertainty absolved him of responsibility for action. She had watched him build that fortress stone by stone, question by question, until doubt became identity.

*He cannot stop questioning even when questioning serves paralysis.*

The observation arrived with the precision of diagnosis.

And beneath the observation, something she would not examine: *I cannot stop strategizing even when strategy produces backfire.*

The parallel pressed against walls that had no room for it.

His doubt in exchange for safety. Her precision in exchange for success. The same bargain wearing different forms. The same belief that systematic analysis would produce the outcome they required.

Jean's bargain had failed. His uncertainty had not protected him. Both factions would move against him for the report she had tried to prevent him submitting.

And her precision—

She filed the thought. Strategy did not require comparison.

The method was sound.

The method would work next time.

One more approach. There had to be one more approach.

The road west of Bordeaux ran through oak forest thick enough to swallow sound, and Jean de Langon died there in the gathering dark.

Lilith watched through temporal perception, not through Marguerite's eyes. The widow had served her purpose and was left behind in her print shop, setting type for pamphlets that would not change the world. Through something older, something that preceded vessels and names and individual faces. Through the awareness that had tracked him since Ka crouched in firelight three hundred thousand years before.

Six riders emerged from the trees. Catholic and Protestant working together, united only in their need to punish the man who had refused to serve either narrative.

Jean's sword cleared its scabbard in the same motion she had seen from Diego's physician hands, from Verinus's investigating patience, from every avatar who understood that defense was sometimes necessary and survival was not guaranteed. He fought. His shoulder, the old wound, she knew its history across bodies, betrayed him. His horse fell. And still he fought.

Not well enough.

A blade took him in the side. Another found his throat.

And in the last bleeding moments, Jean de Langon looked at the stars beginning to show between clouds and said what would matter: "I told the truth about what I didn't know. That was mine to give."

Tightness in Lilith's chest. She refused to name it.

He was dying for honest uncertainty. For the report he had submitted despite knowing it would satisfy no one. For the choice she had tried to prevent him making and had only made more pure by her opposition.

The lesson crystallized bright and terrible in his fading awareness: *If I can die for honest uncertainty, what can I die for with conviction?*

Hunger. The familiar hunger that preceded transition, that pulled consciousness toward its next expression. Not backward into the life that was ending, but forward into something else. Somewhere ahead—a different century, a different cause—that question would find its answer.

Manchester crept back around her: grey light, stiff limbs, the laptop still glowing with faculty pages she had not meant to keep open. Jean's body lay on a French road four hundred years in the past. Her body sat in a Fallowfield flat surrounded by the evidence of failed precision.

The precision itself had created the friction that forged his breakthrough.

A pull in her chest she could not afford to call grief drew her toward him. Toward continuing. Toward *what?*

The race. The stakes. Strategic necessity.

She filed the sensation.

*Why am I still trying?*

The thought surfaced before she could suppress it. Emotional manipulation had failed—Sor Catalina's backfire still fresh. Intellectual precision had failed—Jean's breakthrough still visible on that French road. The pattern was structural. Every intervention accelerated what she opposed.

Any reasonable assessment would conclude: abandon historical intervention. The methodology itself was flawed.

But she was already planning the next method. Already cycling through possibilities. Already reaching for one more.

The persistence exceeded any rational justification for continuing.

Something in her chest that had nothing to do with strategy. Nothing to do with the race. Nothing to do with winning. A pull that exceeded any rational calculation for why she should continue.

She filed the observation and did not examine what it meant.

She reached for the laptop.

Grey Manchester light filtered through curtains she had not opened in days.

The flat felt smaller than it was. Not physically, but perceptually. Walls pressing in. Space narrowing. The particular claustrophobia of strategies running out while the opponent's thread continued unspooling toward a threshold that admitted only one.

Lilith set down the cold tea she had been holding without drinking and poured a fresh cup. This one would also go cold. She knew this with the same certainty she knew Jean de Langon was dead and the lesson was learned and the backfire was complete.

Numerous interventions. Numerous structural failures.

But this one was different. The realization settled into her like cold water spreading through cloth.

He had accessed it mid-life. Not at death—mid-life. Every avatar before this one had learned their lesson in the dying, in the final moment when the veil thinned and accumulated wisdom could finally surface. Jean de Langon had reached for it while still breathing, still choosing, still capable of action. The certainty in his voice when he told the magistrate "It is mine. And it is true"—that wasn't the peace of a dying man. That was someone drawing on reserves he shouldn't have been able to reach.

*He's accessing accumulated learning earlier than any previous incarnation.*

*The veil is thinning for him.*

The University of Manchester faculty page still glowed on her laptop. Backup strategy, she had called it. Contingency planning. But the pull toward present-day contact was strengthening, and the reason was crystallizing into something she could no longer dismiss.

*He's not just progressing. He's accelerating.*

*I'm running out of time.*

Her jaw was clenched again. Her hands pressed flat against the desk as if to still them.

Her fingers moved across laptop keys. The University of Manchester philosophy department page gave way to faculty listings. Course schedules. Campus maps showing buildings she had memorized without acknowledging why.

If historical interventions continued failing, if temporal distance was the wrong variable, then perhaps spatial proximity—

The thought completed itself before she could suppress it.

*What if I met him directly?*

Not as Marguerite or Sor Catalina or any of the vessels she had worn across centuries. Directly. In present time. In the same Manchester where his thread would eventually surface if she traced it forward through Wei Shufen's rebellion, through the noir detective's smoke-wreathed failure, through all the remaining lives she had yet to track.

Philosophy faculty. Contemporary ethics. The kind of institutional positioning a soul of his particular pattern might find comfortable.

She clicked through to individual profiles. Not identifying him yet—, for he did not know which face the consciousness wore now, but building the infrastructure to find out. Seminar schedules. Office hours. Department events open to external visitors.

Strategic preparation. Backup methodology. The contingency plans one maintained when historical approaches kept producing the same structural failure.

*One more. One more. One more.*

The rhythm pulsed beneath her awareness like a heartbeat she could not slow. Jean's method had failed. The intellectual approach had backfired exactly as the emotional approach had backfired exactly as every approach had backfired since she first pushed her awareness into Ka's prehistoric timeline.

But there had to be something. Some variable she was missing. Some refinement that would produce different results.

Wei Shufen's thread was already visible. the Taiping Rebellion, conviction sharp enough to die for, the question Jean had seeded finally finding its answer in 1862. She would track that next. One more historical intervention. One more attempt at correction.

And if that failed—

The campus maps remained open on her laptop. The faculty pages remained bookmarked. The research she insisted was backup planning sat visible on her screen like evidence of something she refused to examine.

The flat was too small. The methods were running out. The pull toward direct confrontation grew stronger with every backfire.

*One more. One more. One more.*

Grey light. Cold tea. The university page glowing with information she would use when she admitted to herself what she was already planning.

Already strategizing. Always strategizing. One more.

The wheel turned.
