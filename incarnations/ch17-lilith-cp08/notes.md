# Chapter 17 - Lilith CP08: The Pivot

## Context
Following Chapter 16 (Renaissance Skeptic - France, 1588)
Lilith age 32, 3 years before Chapter 1

## Power Level
**Extended interaction** - deeper observation and influence, but still from distance

## What Happened in Chapter 16
- Jean de Langon (Silas's avatar) grappled with doubt and uncertainty
- Marguerite Viret (regular historical character) engaged Jean in philosophical debates about skepticism
- Isabeau de Carcassonne (Lilith's past incarnation) was present at the ball but did NOT interact with Jean
- Jean achieved breakthrough: truthfulness without certainty
- Died for honest uncertainty, seeds next incarnation

## Key Beats for Chapter 17
**The Backfire Pattern Now Undeniable**
- Seven years, seven interventions, seven backfires
- She's not stopping him—she's TRAINING him
- Distance is the problem: working through past won't work
- THE PIVOT: Decision to find him in present timeline

**Isabeau Recognition (Minor Beat)**
- Brief observation: another past life present at the ball (as expected)
- Lilith already knows she has past lives (established Ch13/15)
- Notes without drama: Isabeau stayed peripheral, didn't engage
- Confirms pattern of parallel lives, maintained distance
- Not a revelation—just another data point

## Chapter 17 Objectives
1. Observe and process the Chapter 16 backfire (doubt sharpened into truthfulness)
2. Seven years of tracking, seven failures—the pattern is undeniable
3. Brief recognition: Isabeau at ball (toned down, she already knows about her past lives)
4. THE PIVOT: Decide to find him in the present, not the past
5. Begin searching for next incarnation (Ch18, Taiping) as bridge to present
6. Professional life deteriorating; considering leave from NHS

## Backfire Pattern Now Undeniable
Every intervention accelerates him:
- Ch5: Betrayal taught generosity
- Ch7: Dreams clarified rather than confused
- Ch9: Obstacles strengthened resolve
- Ch11: Pride-mirror revealed truth
- Ch13: Her past self's presence created crucible
- Ch15: Hatred became release
- Ch17: Doubt became truthfulness

## Emotional State
Intellectually exhausted; frustrated but not desperate
Beginning to see the pattern: she's TRAINING him, not stopping him
The decision to find him in present is strategic shift, not panic
