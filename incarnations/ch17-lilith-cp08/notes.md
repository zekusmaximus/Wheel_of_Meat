# Chapter 17 - Lilith CP08: The Pivot

## Context
Following Chapter 16 (Renaissance Skeptic - France, 1588)
Lilith age 32, 3 years before Chapter 1

## Power Level
**Extended interaction** - deeper observation and influence, but still from distance

## What Happened in Chapter 16
- Jean de Langon (Silas's avatar) grappled with doubt and uncertainty
- Marguerite Viret (regular historical character) engaged Jean in philosophical debates about skepticism
- Isabeau de Carcassonne (Lilith's past incarnation) was present at the ball but did NOT interact with Jean
- Jean achieved breakthrough: truthfulness without certainty
- Died for honest uncertainty, seeds next incarnation

## Key Revelation for Chapter 17
**Lilith discovers one of her past lives was present in 1588**
- When tracking back, she sees Isabeau at the ball
- Realizes: one of HER past incarnations was in the same time/place as one of HIS
- But Isabeau wisely did not engage—just observed
- This is significant: their paths have been closer than she realized
- YET this makes her decision to find him in modern times more urgent
- Modern Manchester will be the FIRST time they actually converse across lifetimes

## Chapter 17 Objectives
1. Observe and process the Chapter 16 backfire (doubt sharpened into truthfulness)
2. Discover her own past incarnation was present (Isabeau)
3. Seven years of tracking, seven failures—the pattern is undeniable
4. THE PIVOT: Decide to find him in the present, not the past
5. Begin searching for next incarnation (Ch18, Taiping) as bridge to present
6. Professional life deteriorating; considering leave from NHS

## Backfire Pattern Now Undeniable
Every intervention accelerates him:
- Ch5: Betrayal taught generosity
- Ch7: Dreams clarified rather than confused
- Ch9: Obstacles strengthened resolve
- Ch11: Pride-mirror revealed truth
- Ch13: Her past self's presence created crucible
- Ch15: Hatred became release
- Ch17: Doubt became truthfulness

## Emotional State
Intellectually exhausted; frustrated but not desperate
Beginning to see the pattern: she's TRAINING him, not stopping him
The decision to find him in present is strategic shift, not panic
