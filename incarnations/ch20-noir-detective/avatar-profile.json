    "family": "Irish-American working class. Father: dockworker/union man, died in industrial accident (1912). Mother: seamstress, died of influenza (1919). No living family.",
    "military_service": "U.S. Army, WWI, 1917-1918 (age 17-18, lied about age). Fought in France: Belleau Wood, Meuse-Argonne. Returned 1919.",
    "lapd_career": "Joined LAPD 1920 (age 20)—needed structure, paycheck, purpose. Beat cop → Detective Division by 1928. Reputation: good cop, good detective, played by the rules.",
    "quit_force_1936": "Ordered to cover up evidence in murder case (Combination-connected suspect). Refused, threatened with demotion/termination. Quit before they could fire him. Walked away from pension, seniority, everything.",

    "recent_failures": "Last 6 months: cases going south, clients disappearing, witnesses recanting. Doesn't know it's Lilith sabotaging everything. Thinks he's lost his touch, getting old, drinking too much."

  "psychology": {
    "core_flaw_manifestation": "Attachment to personal code: 'Someone has to give a damn.' Can't walk away from people who need help. Compulsive helping dressed up as cynical pragmatism. Says he does it for money, but takes cases he knows won't pay. The code is noble; the attachment to it is the fetter. Will die because he can't let go of the corruption case.",
    "fatal_flaw": "The compulsive helping manifests as attachment to his personal code. He tells himself he's just doing a job, but he's attached to being 'the one who still cares.' This is subtle spiritual obstacle: the helper identity is still identity. Noble on surface, fetter underneath. Will get him killed—but also purify the perfection of Energy (viriya).",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Drinks too much (self-medicating loneliness, war trauma)",
      "Cynical but not cynical enough (still believes in justice)",
      "Attracted to dangerous women (weakness Lilith exploits)",
      "Won't walk away even when smart",
      "Pride (won't admit he's in over his head)",

      "Reads pulp detective magazines (ironic enjoyment)",
      "Listens to The Shadow on radio"

    "living_situation": "SRO boarding room, Bunker Hill ($6/week). Spartan: Murphy bed, hotplate, clothes, typewriter. Shared bathroom down hall. No social life (no friends, no girlfriend, no family). Eats at Clifton's, drinks at dive bars. Lonely but won't admit it. Work is his life."
  },
  "chapter_arc": {
    "opening_state": "Morning after a failed case (witness recanted, client fired him). Hung over, frustrated, questioning everything. Rent is due, money's tight. Knows he should quit taking cases, but can't. When REAL reformers approach him with corruption case, he should refuse—but doesn't. 'Someone has to give a damn, even if it kills me.' (It will.) Lilith manipulates timing: ensures he's desperate when offer comes.",
    "inciting_incident": "REAL reformers (connected to Shaw recall movement) hire Malone to gather evidence against Shaw administration. Legitimate case, legitimate danger. Good money, chance to take down the Combination. He knows it's dangerous (Raymond bombing still fresh). Takes it anyway because someone has to.",
    "main_case": "Corruption expose: hired by REAL reformers to gather evidence against Mayor Shaw, Chief Davis, and Combination enforcers. Timeline: January (post-Raymond bombing) through March (Great Flood). The case is genuine—real corruption, real danger. Lilith accelerates failures from distance but doesn't orchestrate case. Combination bombs his car (standard tactic, not Lilith's doing).",
    "subplot_cases": [
      "Missing person (early): Finds husband for worried wife—dead in alley next day (Combination hit, unrelated to his case), wife denies hiring him (scared). Pattern begins.",
      "Blackmail case (mid): Client being blackmailed—discovers client guilty of worse, blackmailer turns up dead (made to look like Malone did it), police harassment escalates. Another failure."
    ],
    "relationship_with_lilith": "NO RELATIONSHIP. He doesn't know her. She appears 3 times total as background figure: (1) in a bar early on—he doesn't notice, (2) woman on street near his office mid-chapter—fleeting sense of familiarity he dismisses, (3) passerby when bomb goes off—'rushing to avoid' explosion. She manipulates from distance (accelerates witness deaths, ensures evidence destroyed faster, makes him too visible to Combination). He never interacts with her.",
    "climax": "Late March 1938, during/after Great Flood. Case has fallen apart, he's marked for death by COMBINATION (they decide to bomb him, not Lilith), knows it. Gets in Buick Roadmaster, turns key. Car bomb (starter-wired by Combination enforcers) detonates. Lilith appears on street as passerby, 'rushing to avoid' explosion.",
    "closing_state": "Extended bleed-out sequence in the rain. Realizes: (1) Lesson of viriya—perseverance purified of outcome-attachment, (2) All ten perfections complete across lives, (3) Strong urge to break first three fetters in next life, (4) This urge propels rebirth as Silas Pahlavan. Dies with anticipation, readiness, completion. Not defeat—victory. Rain falling, blood washing away, eyes closing. Lilith watching from distance, horrified (realizes all perfections complete, modern stream-entry inevitable). Chapter ends.",
    "death_context": "Car bomb explosion planted by COMBINATION (echoes Harry Raymond bombing). Bleeds out in rain during/after Great Flood. Final thoughts: completion recognition, stream-entry urge, anticipation of next life. Lilith observes from distance as passerby."

  "lesson_development": {
    "perfection_or_fetter": "Perfection: Energy (viriya) — Right effort, perseverance, sustained effort without attachment to results. FINAL PERFECTION: All ten complete by end of this life.",
    "what_learned": "True viriya = continuing because it's right, not because it succeeds. Every failed case was practice in right effort without outcome-attachment. He never stopped trying, even knowing it was futile. The perseverance purified of ego, results, need for victory. 'I didn't save anyone. But the trying was not nothing.'",
    "what_failed": "The corruption case falls apart completely. Every witness dies or recants. Every piece of evidence destroyed (many by flood). Reformers back out, deny hiring him. Newspaper won't print his findings. He solves nothing, saves no one, changes nothing. The Combination wins. He dies.",
    "death_seeds_next": "All ten perfections complete. Strong urge to break first three fetters (self-illusion, doubt, rites/rituals) in next life. This urge is powerful enough to direct rebirth → Silas Pahlavan, the life where stream-entry happens. Dies anticipating breakthrough.",
    "backfire_mechanism": "Lilith accelerates failures from distance to break his perseverance. Instead, teaches him outcome-independent perseverance FASTER. He continues despite knowing it's pointless: 'Someone has to give a damn, even if it changes nothing.' This purifies viriya from attachment to success. He dies persevering—ALL TEN PERFECTIONS COMPLETE. She watches from distance, horrified: next life is stream-entry, modern intimacy strategy is now desperate necessity, not choice. CATASTROPHIC final historical backfire."

    "power_level": "Observer with circumstantial manipulation (NOT full manifestation). Can observe from 2032-2033 contemporary position. Can manipulate circumstances, timing, accelerate existing dangers. Brief physical appearances only (3 total). LAST attempt at past-life intervention before modern intimacy strategy.",
    "emotional_state": "Testing whether minimal intervention works where active interference failed. Already committed to intimacy strategy from Ch19. Watching to confirm he's completing perfections. Desperate but learning restraint. When she sees all ten perfections complete, realizes modern intimacy is only path left.",
    "manifestation": "MINIMAL PRESENCE, NOT FEMME FATALE. Distant observer. Brief appearances (3 times): (1) background in bar early—he doesn't notice, (2) woman on street mid—fleeting familiarity he dismisses, (3) passerby at bomb—'rushing to avoid' (Ch1 flashback). He barely notices her. No relationship. Canonical face (widow's peak, dark strand left, pale green crescent) visible to readers; Malone just sees stranger.",
    "method": "Manipulates from distance like Taiping Ch18. Does NOT create the case—it's real. Accelerates existing failures: ensures witnesses die faster (Combination was killing them anyway), evidence destroyed sooner, he's too visible to Combination (they mark him). Combination plants bomb (standard tactic), not her. She just speeds their timeline.",
    "sabotage_pattern": [
      "Ensures he takes case: manipulates timing (desperate when offered), removes other jobs, but reformers/case are real",
      "Accelerates failures: witnesses die faster (Combination kills them), evidence destroyed sooner, flood targets his records",
      "Makes him too visible: Combination notices him as threat faster, decides to bomb him sooner",

Lilith just ensures Malone is visible enough that they mark him, accelerates their decision timeline. She doesn't set it up—she ensures it happens. Appears on street when it goes off, 'rushing to avoid' explosion.",
    "backfire": "CATASTROPHIC. Accelerating failures teaches outcome-independent perseverance faster. He completes ALL TEN PERFECTIONS. She watches from distance, horrified: he's ready for stream-entry in next life. Modern intimacy strategy is no longer optional—it's desperate last resort. Ch21 explanation: 'I tried minimal intervention. It failed worse than everything before. He's done. The intimacy strategy wasn't Plan A—it was my only option left.'"

Car bomb death matches Ch1 flashback (rain, Buick Roadmaster, Lilith as passerby). CRITICAL: Lilith is MINIMAL PRESENCE (3 brief appearances), NOT femme fatale client. Real reformers hire him, real Combination bombs him. She accelerates from distance. This justifies Ch21 modern intimacy strategy as desperate last resort. First-person noir voice essential. Malone is protagonist, Combination is antagonist, Lilith is distant observer. Spiritual triumph disguised as worldly defeat."
