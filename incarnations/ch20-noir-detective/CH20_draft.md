Her name was Margaret Sinclair, and she was the wrong kind of beautiful for a detective agency on Bunker Hill. Blonde hair waved like they did it in the pictures, a face that belonged on a movie poster, and clothes that cost more than my monthly rent. She sat in the client chair and twisted her gloves in her hands, and everything about her screamed money looking for trouble.

"My husband," she said. "Frank. He's been missing for three days."

I leaned back in my chair. "Have you talked to the police?"

"The police told me to wait. Said men go missing all the time, most of them turn up." Her voice cracked on the last word. "But Frank wouldn't do this. He wouldn't leave without telling me. Something's wrong."

I should have turned her away. The corruption case was taking all my time, and missing persons work is unpredictable—could be wrapped up in an afternoon, could drag on for weeks. But she was sitting there with tears threatening to spill from eyes the color of summer sky, and Frank Sinclair was someone's husband, and someone had to give a damn.

"Tell me about him," I said.

Frank Sinclair was an accountant. Forty-two years old, worked for a shipping firm downtown. No debts, no vices, no enemies that Margaret knew of. They'd been married fifteen years, no children. Frank left for work Tuesday morning like always. Never came home.

"I've called his office," she said. "They say he left at five o'clock, same as usual. But he drives, Mr. Malone, and his car was still in the parking structure when I went to look. Just sitting there. His briefcase was inside, his lunch pail. Everything except Frank."

I took notes. The shipping firm's name—Pacific Coast Transport—rang a faint bell somewhere in my memory, but I couldn't place it. The parking structure was downtown, on Spring Street, near enough to my office that I could walk it.

"Two hundred dollars," I said. "Retainer against twenty-five a day. If I find him fast, I'll refund what I don't use."

She didn't blink. Just opened her purse and counted out the bills with fingers that trembled slightly. I gave her a receipt and told her I'd be in touch.

After she left, I sat at my desk and stared at the notes I'd taken. Something about the case felt wrong—not the case itself, which was straightforward enough, but the timing of it. Six months of failing cases, then Vernon Shaw's reform money, and now a beautiful woman with a missing husband. Three pieces that didn't seem to connect but somehow felt like they should.

I filed the feeling away and went to work.

---

Finding Frank Sinclair took me two days.

He wasn't hard to trace. I started at the parking structure, bribed the attendant for his sign-out log (he hadn't signed out), then worked backward from there. The shipping firm was on a corner of Second Street, a squat brick building with Pacific Coast Transport painted on the windows in letters that had seen better decades. Frank's colleagues remembered him leaving at five. The receptionist had seen him heading toward the parking structure. Nobody remembered anything unusual.

I spent the afternoon canvassing the blocks between the office and the garage. A shoeshine boy remembered a man matching Frank's description talking to another man on the corner of Second and Spring, around five-fifteen. They'd gotten into a car together. The shoeshine boy hadn't thought anything of it—businessmen got into cars all the time.

The car was a Packard, dark green, California plates. That narrowed it down to about ten thousand cars in Los Angeles County.

The second day, I got lucky. A beat cop I knew from my time on the force, one of the few who wasn't on the Combination's payroll, remembered a drunk and disorderly call from a flophouse on Fifth Street. The man had been raving about "Frank" and "the shipping company" and "they'll kill us both." The cops had let him sleep it off and released him in the morning.

I found the flophouse. The clerk remembered the drunk—middle-aged, looked like he hadn't eaten in days, kept mumbling about numbers and ledgers. He'd checked out that morning, but the clerk had seen him head south toward the Mission District.

I worked the missions for the rest of the day. The third one, a place called Saint Vincent's, had given a meal to a man matching the description. He'd told the volunteer his name was Eddie Garza, and he was hiding from people who wanted to hurt him.

Eddie Garza. I knew that name. It was on Vernon Shaw's list—a bookkeeper who'd worked for one of the Combination's front businesses before having a crisis of conscience. He'd been scheduled for an interview next week.

The connection clicked into place like a key finding its lock.

Frank Sinclair, accountant for a shipping company. Eddie Garza, bookkeeper for the mob. Both men who worked with numbers, both men who'd seen things they shouldn't have seen. The shipping company—Pacific Coast Transport—I remembered now where I'd heard the name. It was in the folder. One of the businesses suspected of laundering Combination money.

Frank Sinclair hadn't gone missing. He'd run. And Eddie Garza was running too, from the same people, for the same reasons.

I found Eddie Garza in an alley behind a Chinese restaurant on Alameda Street, huddled against a dumpster with a bottle of rotgut whiskey clutched in his hand. He was a small man, Hispanic, maybe fifty, with the hollow eyes and shaking hands of someone who'd stopped sleeping weeks ago.

"You Malone?" He looked up at me without surprise, as if he'd been expecting someone like me to find him eventually. "Frank said you might come."

"Frank Sinclair?"

"We were going to the reformers together. Had it all planned. The ledgers, the names, everything. Then they found out." He took a long pull from the bottle. "I don't know how, but they found out. Frank went to get his car and never came back."

"Where is he now?"

Eddie Garza's eyes went flat. "You haven't heard?"

A cold weight settled in my stomach. "Heard what?"

"They found him this morning. In an alley off Sixth Street." Eddie's voice dropped to a whisper. "Cops are calling it a robbery gone wrong. But there wasn't any robbery, Malone. They beat him and they killed him and they left him in the trash like garbage."

---

I called Margaret Sinclair from a payphone on Spring Street.

The conversation lasted three minutes. I told her I'd found her husband. I told her where the body was. I told her I was sorry. She made a sound on the other end of the line that wasn't quite a scream and wasn't quite a sob, and then she hung up.

I stood in the phone booth for a long time after that, listening to the dial tone. Thinking about Frank Sinclair, who'd seen something wrong and tried to do something right, and died in an alley for his trouble. Thinking about Eddie Garza, shaking in that alley, waiting for his turn.

Thinking about the fact that I'd found Frank Sinclair in two days, and it hadn't made a damn bit of difference.

When I went to the police station to file my report, the desk sergeant looked at me like I was something he'd scraped off his shoe.

"Sinclair case?" He didn't bother checking his notes. "Robbery homicide. Case closed."

"He was a witness in a corruption investigation. He was—"

"Case closed, Malone." The sergeant's voice went cold. "Unless you want to make a statement about your own involvement in whatever got him killed."

I left.

The next morning, Margaret Sinclair called my office. Her voice was different now—flat, controlled, empty of everything that had made her seem human two days ago.

"I never hired you, Mr. Malone."

"Ma'am—"

"I never hired you. I don't know who you are. Please don't contact me again."

The line went dead.

---

That afternoon, I sat in a bar on Main Street and tried to make sense of what had happened. The corruption case was still alive—none of my witnesses had recanted yet, none of the evidence had disappeared. But Frank Sinclair was dead, Margaret Sinclair had erased me from her memory, and Eddie Garza had vanished from the alley where I'd found him, leaving nothing behind but an empty whiskey bottle and a bloodstain that might have been his or might have been someone else's.

The bar was dim and smoky, the kind of place where people came to disappear for a few hours. I was working on my second rye when I noticed her.

She was sitting in a booth across the room. Dark hair styled in victory rolls, a dress that caught what little light there was in the place. Beautiful, in a way that made you want to look twice, then look away, then look back again. Her face was angled toward the window, but I could see the sharp line of her widow's peak, the single darker strand that fell across her forehead.

Something about her tugged at my attention. Not attraction—or not just attraction. Something else. A sense of recognition I couldn't place, like seeing a face in a dream and knowing it means something without knowing what.

I watched her for a long moment. She didn't look at me. Didn't seem to notice I was there at all. She was watching the street outside, her expression unreadable, her hands wrapped around a glass she hadn't touched.

Then someone walked between us—another patron heading for the bar—and when the sightline cleared, she was gone. The booth was empty. The glass sat on the table, still full, condensation running down its sides.

I hadn't seen her leave.

I paid for my drinks and went back to my office, the image of her face lodged somewhere behind my eyes like a splinter I couldn't quite reach.

---

The corruption case moved forward. I interviewed three more witnesses that week. Got solid statements from two of them. The third—a police sergeant who'd been willing to talk about payoff schedules—called me the morning of our meeting to say he'd changed his mind.

"Sorry, Malone. Can't do it. Just... can't."

He hung up before I could ask what had changed.

But the other interviews were good. The evidence was building. Vernon Shaw called to check in, and I told him we were making progress, and he sounded pleased.

I didn't tell him about Frank Sinclair. About the missing person case that had turned into a murder I couldn't solve and a wife who'd pretended I didn't exist. About the police sergeant who'd changed his mind for reasons he couldn't or wouldn't explain.

I didn't tell him about the woman in the bar, either. The one who'd disappeared without leaving.

Some things don't fit into reports. Some things you file away and try not to think about until they make sense.

Frank Sinclair's body was released to his wife three days later. The funeral was small—just Margaret and a few family members, standing in the rain at Forest Lawn while a minister said words that didn't mean anything. I watched from a distance, standing under a tree at the edge of the cemetery, and wondered if I should have refused the case. If Frank would still be alive if I'd never started looking for him.

The answer was no, probably. He'd been marked the moment he decided to talk. But the wondering was there anyway, a weight I couldn't put down.

Someone had to give a damn.

Even when giving a damn got people killed.

---

**Word count: ~2,300**


The first sign was Doyle, the clerk from the assessor's office. He'd been my most reliable source—a man whose hands never stopped moving, but committed. He'd given me two depositions, each one more damning than the last. We had a third meeting scheduled for the second week of February, at a diner on Figueroa where the coffee was terrible and the booths were private.

He didn't show.

I waited an hour, smoking through half a pack of Lucky Strikes, before I gave up and went to his apartment. The landlady told me he'd moved out three days ago. Left in the middle of the night, she said. Didn't leave a forwarding address.

"Did he seem scared?" I asked.

She looked at me like I'd asked if the sun rose in the east. "Mister, everybody in this city is scared. What kind of question is that?"

I tried to find him. Checked the boarding houses, the missions, the bus stations. Doyle had vanished as thoroughly as if he'd never existed. The only trace he left was a gap in my evidence file where his depositions should have been—and when I checked the folder, I found the pages blank. Water damage, maybe, or some chemical process I didn't understand. The ink had simply... disappeared.

---

The second sign was Muñoz, the bartender from The Blue Parrot.

He didn't vanish. He recanted.

I found him behind the bar on a Tuesday afternoon, polishing glasses with a rag that had seen better years. When he saw me walk in, his face went pale.

"I can't talk to you."

"We talked before. You gave me a statement—"

"I was drunk." He wouldn't meet my eyes. "I made it up. All of it. I never saw any payoffs, never heard any names. I'm just a bartender, Malone. I pour drinks. That's all."

I leaned on the bar, close enough to smell the fear on him. Sour, chemical, the smell of a man who hadn't slept in days.

"What did they offer you? Money? Or just the promise that they wouldn't kill you?"

For a moment, something flickered in his eyes. Recognition. Anger. The remnant of the man who'd sat across from me in a back booth and told me about protection payments and police visits and the steady corruption that made his business possible.

Then it was gone.

"Get out of my bar, Malone. I don't know you. I never knew you."

---

The third sign was Helen Marsh.

She was dead.

I found out from the newspaper, not the police. A small story buried on page twelve: CITY EMPLOYEE DIES IN AUTO ACCIDENT. Helen Marsh, 34, formerly of the Chief of Police's office, had lost control of her car on Mulholland Drive and plunged two hundred feet into a canyon. The car had burned on impact. The body was badly damaged. The funeral would be private.

I read the story three times, looking for something I could use. There was nothing. Just another death in a city full of them.

But I remembered Helen Marsh. Remembered the way she'd looked when she gave me her statement, the mix of fear and relief, like a woman finally putting down a weight she'd been carrying for too long. She'd been brave. She'd wanted to do the right thing.

And now she was dead in a canyon, and the official story was "auto accident," and nobody would ever prove otherwise.

---

I kept working.

That was the thing about the case, about this city, about the whole rotten mess of it—there was always more work to do. Another witness to interview, another lead to follow, another thread to pull. The losses mounted up, but so did the evidence. I told myself it was a race, and all I had to do was stay ahead.

I photographed documents in courthouse basements when the clerks weren't looking. I bribed a printer at City Hall for copies of internal memos. I spent hours in the morgue at the Los Angeles Times, paging through back issues, connecting dates and names and numbers until the web of corruption was so dense I could barely see through it.

Vernon Shaw checked in weekly. He was pleased with the progress, his voice tightening when we discussed the losses. "We can replace witnesses," he said, though we both knew it wasn't true. "The important thing is the documentation. As long as we have the paper trail, we can make the case."

I didn't tell him about the blank pages in Doyle's file. About the photographs that had developed wrong, showing only shadows where there should have been faces. About the growing sense that something was working against me, something that operated on a level I couldn't understand.

Because if I told him that, I'd have to admit I was starting to believe it. And believing in things you couldn't see was the first step toward madness.

---

The weather broke at the end of the second week—a few days of sunshine that felt like a reprieve. I took the opportunity to drive out to Santa Monica, where one of the Combination's gambling ships, the S.S. Rex, sat anchored three miles offshore, just outside the legal limit.

The Rex was Tony Cornero's operation, the most successful of the floating casinos. Water taxis ferried passengers out from the pier, charging a quarter for the privilege of losing money in international waters. The city couldn't touch it. The state couldn't touch it. Federal agents occasionally made noise about shutting it down, but Cornero had lawyers, and the lawyers had lawyers, and nothing ever happened.

I wasn't trying to shut it down. I just wanted to see how the money moved.

I paid my quarter and rode out with a boatload of tourists and regulars, middle-aged men in suits and women in dresses that sparkled under the afternoon sun. The Rex loomed larger as we approached—a converted cargo ship with three decks of gambling halls, bars, restaurants. A floating city of vice, bobbing gently in the Pacific swell.

Inside, the noise was tremendous. Slot machines churning, dice rattling, the constant murmur of dealers calling numbers and announcing payouts. The carpet was red, the walls were gilt, and the smoke hung in the air thick enough to chew. I walked through the crowds, watching. Learning.

The money flowed like water. Cash to chips, chips to cash, winnings skimmed by the house at every transaction. I counted the staff—dealers, pit bosses, security men—and tried to calculate how much was moving through this room in a single afternoon. Thousands, at least. Maybe tens of thousands. And all of it funneling back to Los Angeles, to the Combination, to Mayor Shaw's pocket through channels so convoluted they might as well have been invisible.

This was what I was fighting. Not a man, not even an organization, but a current. Money flowing downhill, finding the path of least resistance, corrupting everything it touched. You couldn't stop a river by arresting one drop of water.

But you could build a dam. If you had enough evidence. If you had enough time. If you could keep the water from washing you away.

I stayed on the Rex for three hours, watching and taking mental notes. When I caught the water taxi back to shore, the sun was setting over the Pacific, painting the water gold and red, beautiful in the way this city was always beautiful—on the surface, and only on the surface.

---

The ride back to Bunker Hill took an hour in evening traffic. I parked my Buick—a three-year-old Roadmaster I'd bought cheap from a widow who didn't need it anymore—in the alley behind my boarding house and climbed the stairs to my room. The door was unlocked.

I drew my gun before I pushed it open.

The room had been tossed. Not ransacked—nothing was broken, nothing was destroyed—but every drawer had been opened, every pile of papers rifled through, every hiding place I thought I had discovered and examined. My spare suit lay crumpled on the bed. My case files were scattered across the floor. Even the coffee can on top of the icebox had been moved, though the money inside was untouched.

A message.

I stood in the doorway for a long moment, the Colt heavy in my hand, listening for sounds that might indicate whoever had done this was still here. The building creaked and settled. Water dripped somewhere in the walls. Nothing else.

I holstered the gun and walked inside.

They hadn't found anything, because there was nothing to find. The real evidence was in my office safe, not my room. But they knew I existed now. They knew I was looking. They knew where I lived.

The game had changed.

I poured myself a drink from the bottle I kept in my nightstand—the one they hadn't touched, either because they weren't interested or because they wanted me to know they could have—and sat on the edge of my bed, looking at the mess they'd made of my life.

Tomorrow, I would clean this up. Tomorrow, I would keep working. Tomorrow, I would interview more witnesses and gather more evidence and inch closer to a case that might or might not survive long enough to matter.

But tonight, I sat in my ransacked room and drank whiskey and wondered how much longer I had before they stopped sending messages and started sending bullets.

The rain started again sometime after midnight. I heard it on the roof, steady and relentless, the sound of Los Angeles trying to drown itself. The crack in my ceiling had spread another inch. Water would be through before spring.

I finished the drink, lay down on my unmade bed, and closed my eyes.

Someone had to give a damn.

Even when giving a damn might get you killed.

While I'd been in custody, someone had visited my office.

They'd been more thorough this time. The filing cabinet stood open, its contents scattered across the floor. The safe—which I'd thought was secure—had been forced open, the door hanging askew. Everything inside was gone: the money Vernon Shaw had given me, the copies of documents, the photographs, the witness statements. Two months of work, vanished.

I stood in the wreckage and felt something cold settle in my chest.

This wasn't just a warning anymore. This was erasure. Someone was trying to unmake my case, piece by piece, as if it had never existed.

The phone rang.

I picked it up without thinking, still staring at the violated safe.

"Malone?" Vernon Shaw's voice, thin and urgent. "I've been trying to reach you. I heard about the arrest—"

"They cleaned me out," I said. "Everything. The documents, the photographs, all of it. Someone broke into my safe while I was in holding."

A long silence on the other end of the line.

"How much do you have left?"

I looked around the office. At the papers scattered on the floor, most of them useless—old case files, receipts, letters from clients who'd moved on or died or simply forgotten I existed. At the empty safe, its interior mocking me with its bareness.

"My notes," I said. "The ones I kept on my person. Maybe a third of what I had. And my memory, for what that's worth."

Another silence. When Vernon spoke again, his voice had changed—harder, with a ragged edge to it.

"We're running out of time, Malone. The recall petition is due next month. If we don't have enough evidence by then—"

"I know."

"Can you rebuild it? The witness statements, the documentation—"

"Some of it. Maybe. If the witnesses are still willing to talk." I rubbed my jaw, the stubble rough against my palm. "Half of them have recanted or disappeared. The ones who are left are scared. After this, they're going to be more scared."

"We have to try."

I closed my eyes. Thought about Harry Raymond, lying in his hospital bed. Thought about Helen Marsh, burning in a canyon. Thought about Doyle and Muñoz and all the others who'd decided that silence was safer than speech.

"Yeah," I said. "We have to try."

---

I left the office and walked.

The rain had stopped, but the streets were still wet, reflecting the gray sky and the neon signs that had started to flicker on even though it was barely noon. I walked without direction, letting my feet carry me while my mind worked through the wreckage of the case.

The pattern was undeniable now. It wasn't just bad luck, wasn't just the normal attrition of a corruption investigation. Someone was actively sabotaging me—someone who knew my moves before I made them, who could reach my witnesses before I did, who could crack my safe and destroy my evidence while I sat helpless in a holding cell.

The Combination was the obvious answer. They had the resources, the reach, the motivation. But the precision of it nagged at me. This wasn't the Combination's usual style—they preferred blunt force, intimidation, bullets and bombs. This was surgical. This was personal.

I was so lost in thought that I almost walked past her.

She was standing on the corner of Hill and Third, near the entrance to my office building. Dark hair caught in the wind, a coat that looked too expensive for this neighborhood, face turned slightly away from me. But there was something about the line of her profile—the sharp widow's peak, the single darker strand falling across her forehead—that made me stop.

The woman from the bar. The one who'd disappeared without leaving.

For a moment, our eyes almost met. I saw her face in profile, and something in my chest lurched—not recognition exactly, but the ghost of recognition, the sense that I knew her from somewhere I couldn't name. Her left eye caught the gray light, and I could have sworn I saw something strange in it, a flicker of color that didn't belong.

Then she turned and walked away, her heels clicking on the wet pavement, her figure receding into the midday crowd. I watched her go, rooted to the spot, unable to shake the feeling that she'd been waiting for me. That she'd wanted me to see her.

By the time I thought to follow, she was gone. Swallowed by the city, as if she'd never been there at all.

I stood on the corner for a long moment, rain beginning to fall again, trying to make sense of what I'd seen. A beautiful woman. A strange face. The feeling of being watched by eyes that knew more than they should.

It didn't fit anywhere. It was a loose thread in a case that was already unraveling.

I should have filed it away with all the other things I couldn't explain.

Instead, I stood on that corner while the rain soaked through my coat, and I thought about the blackmail case. Fifty dollars plus expenses. Good money. Clean money. The kind of case that kept the lights on while the Haversham investigation ate me alive.

But my hand wouldn't reach for the phone.

The woman's face—that widow's peak, that strange flicker in her left eye—lodged in my chest like a splinter I couldn't dig out. The blackmail case felt wrong. Not complicated-wrong. Wrong the way Frank's death had felt wrong. Wrong the way this whole investigation had felt wrong from the first minute, like I was walking through a maze someone else had designed.

*I've seen those eyes before.* I couldn't say where. But I knew not to trust them.

The thought arrived without explanation, certainty without evidence. The kind of knowing that got men killed in this city—acting on instinct instead of facts.

I let the phone ring through.

Made no sense. The money was good. The case was clean. And I needed rent money worse than I needed instincts I couldn't explain.

But something in me knew better than my brain did. Knew that case was a trap, even if I couldn't prove it. Knew that woman on the corner was connected to everything falling apart around me, even if I'd never spoken to her in my life.

*In France—*

I blinked. In France? I'd never been to France.

The thought slid away before I could catch it, leaving only residue. The blackmail case went to someone else. And I went back to the corruption investigation that was probably going to kill me.

*Someone has to give a damn. Even when it doesn't make sense. Even when you can't explain why.*

---

The rebuilding started that afternoon.

I called the witnesses who hadn't recanted—the three who were still willing to talk. Two of them agreed to give me new statements, though their voices were tight with fear, and both of them made me promise I wouldn't write down their names this time. The third, a junior accountant at City Hall, listened to my request and then hung up without a word.

I went back to the courthouse and found the documents I'd photographed, but the originals had been pulled from the files. "Misfiled," the clerk said, not meeting my eyes. "Sometimes things get lost."

I visited the newspaper morgue and requested the back issues I'd used, but half of them had been removed for "repair." The librarian couldn't tell me when they'd be back.

By evening, I had maybe a quarter of what I'd started with. Not enough to make the recall case. Not enough to bring down Shaw. But maybe enough to prove that something was rotten, that the corruption was real, that someone should investigate even if that someone couldn't be me.

I drove back to Bunker Hill as the sun set behind the downtown towers, painting the clouds orange and red. The Buick's engine coughed twice on the hill—needed a tune-up I couldn't afford—but it got me home. I parked in the alley and climbed the stairs to my room, every step feeling heavier than the last.

The door was unlocked again.

I drew my gun, pushed it open with my foot.

Empty. Nothing disturbed. But on my pillow, folded neatly, was a single sheet of paper.

I picked it up with hands that weren't quite steady.

Three words, typed on a machine that left no identifying marks:

STOP OR DIE

I crumpled the paper and threw it in the corner.

Then I poured myself a drink, sat on the edge of my bed, and started writing down everything I could remember. Every witness, every document, every connection I'd made. If they were going to kill me, I was going to make sure the case survived. I was going to put it all in a letter, seal it in an envelope, and leave it with someone I trusted—if I could find anyone in this city I still trusted.

Someone had to give a damn.

Even if it meant dying for nothing.

Gloria Dane worked at a place called The Velvet Room, a nightclub on South Main that catered to businessmen who wanted discretion with their drinks. I went there that night, paid the cover charge, and found a table near the stage where a four-piece band was playing something slow and smoky.

She was easy to spot. Brennan had described her, and besides, she was the kind of woman who drew attention without trying—dark hair, full lips, a figure that the sequined dress she wore did nothing to hide. She moved between tables, smiling at customers, accepting drinks, playing the game that women in her position had to play to survive.

I watched her for an hour before approaching. Watched the men she talked to, the way she touched their arms and laughed at their jokes, the subtle transactions of attention and money that passed between them. She was good at her job. Professional in a way that suggested she'd been doing this long enough to know all the moves.

When she finally came to my table, her smile was automatic, part of the uniform.

"Buy a girl a drink?"

"I'll buy you information," I said. "If you have it."

The smile faltered. She looked at me more closely, and I saw something shift behind her eyes—calculation, wariness, the quick assessment of a woman who'd learned to size up danger.

"I'm not that kind of girl."

"I know exactly what kind of girl you are, Miss Dane." I kept my voice low, neutral. "I know about Howard Brennan. I know about the photographs. What I want to know is whether you're in on the blackmail or just caught in it."

The color drained from her face. She sat down without being invited, her composure cracking.

"How did you—"

"Brennan hired me to find the blackmailer. I'm not interested in ruining your life, Miss Dane. I just need to know who's behind this."

She looked around the club, checking for watchers. Her hands, I noticed, were clenched in her lap.

"I don't know who's doing it," she said finally. "I swear to God, I don't know. The photographs—I didn't even know they existed until someone sent me copies. They told me if I warned Brennan, they'd kill me. If I went to the police, they'd kill me. All I could do was sit here and wait and hope it would be over soon."

I believed her. The fear in her voice was too raw, too immediate to be faked.

"Do you have any enemies? Anyone who knew about you and Brennan, who might want to hurt one or both of you?"

She shook her head. "I was careful. I'm always careful. This shouldn't have happened."

"But it did." I took out my notebook, wrote down my office address and phone number, tore out the page. "If you think of anything—anyone who might have been watching you, any strange contacts, anything at all—call me. Day or night."

She took the paper with trembling fingers. "Are you going to find who did this?"

"I'm going to try."

"And if you don't?"

I didn't have an answer for that. Neither did she.

---

I spent the next two days tracking the blackmailer.

The demand letter led nowhere—generic typewriter, standard paper, postmarked from a mailbox outside the main post office. The photographs were harder. I found a darkroom tech who owed me a favor, and he examined the prints, looking for any identifying marks.

"Professional work," he said, holding the images up to the light. "Good paper, clean development. Whoever took these knew what they were doing. And see here?" He pointed to the edge of one photograph. "That's a Leica lens signature. High-end camera, not the kind you buy at a drugstore."

High-end equipment meant a professional photographer. Someone who'd been hired specifically to take these shots. I started working the list of professionals in the city, showing the photographs to anyone who might recognize the style.

On the second day, I found him.

His name was Jerry Novak, and he worked out of a studio on Sixth Street, taking publicity shots for actors and models who couldn't afford the big names. He was a small man, his fingers never still, with the pale skin of someone who spent too much time in darkrooms.

When I showed him the photographs, his face went white.

"Where did you get these?"

"Doesn't matter. What matters is that you took them."

He tried to lie, but he was bad at it. Within five minutes, I had the whole story. He'd been hired by a man he didn't know—"tall, dark hair, expensive suit, paid cash"—to set up surveillance in a specific hotel room and photograph anyone who came through. He'd delivered the negatives a week ago, collected his fee, and tried to forget the whole thing.

"The man who hired you," I said. "Would you recognize him if you saw him again?"

Novak shook his head. "He wore a hat, kept his face in shadow. I never got a good look. Just the voice—low, flat, no accent. Like he was trying not to have one."

"And the hotel room? Whose name was it under?"

Novak's eyes darted away. "I don't know. I just got the room number and the key. Didn't ask questions."

I left him with a warning not to leave town and a certainty that I was missing something. The man who'd hired Novak wasn't the blackmailer—he was too careful, too professional. He was a cutout, a layer of insulation between the real operator and the dirty work.

But why go to so much trouble to blackmail Howard Brennan? Ten thousand dollars was a lot of money, but not enough to justify this level of planning. There had to be something else. Something I wasn't seeing.

---

I found it the next morning.

I was in the Hall of Records, checking property transfers—still trying to rebuild the corruption case—when I came across Howard Brennan's name. He'd been buying land in the Valley, dozens of parcels over the past year, through a series of shell companies that all traced back to his development firm.

Land that, according to the surveys, was practically worthless. Flood plain, unstable soil, too far from the city to be commercially viable.

Unless you knew something the surveys didn't.

I dug deeper. Found a proposal buried in the city planning archives—a flood control project that would rechannelize the Los Angeles River, making the Valley land valuable. A project that had been quietly approved by the city council three months ago, that hadn't been announced to the public yet, that would make anyone who owned the right parcels very, very rich.

Howard Brennan had insider information. He was buying up land before the flood control announcement, planning to make a fortune on what was essentially legal corruption.

And someone was blackmailing him. Not for the affair—the affair was just leverage. They wanted something else.

I called Brennan's office. His secretary said he was in meetings all day. I called his home. His wife said he'd left early that morning and she didn't know where he was.

I called Gloria Dane at The Velvet Room. No answer.

By noon, I knew something was wrong. By two o'clock, I was certain.

By three, the police were at my door.

---

They found Jerry Novak dead in his studio. Shot twice, close range, with a .38-caliber revolver. The same caliber as the Colt Detective Special I carried in my shoulder holster.

The same Colt that had been taken from my safe when they ransacked my office. The same Colt that had been logged as missing in my report to the insurance company.

I sat in the interrogation room at Central Division, facing Detective Burke and his partner, and watched my life fall apart.

"Let me get this straight," Burke said, a smile spreading across his florid face. "You were investigating a blackmail case. The photographer who took the blackmail photos turns up dead, killed with your gun. And you expect us to believe you had nothing to do with it?"

"Someone stole my gun. You know that. I filed a report."

"A convenient report." Burke leaned forward. "Here's what I think happened, Malone. You found the photographer, you squeezed him for information, and when he couldn't give you what you wanted, you killed him. Or maybe you killed him because he knew too much. Either way, you're looking at a murder charge."

"I didn't kill anyone."

"Then who did?"

I didn't have an answer. The frame was too neat, too perfect. Someone had used my gun to kill Novak, knowing I would be connected to the case, knowing the police would come for me. The same someone who'd been sabotaging the corruption case. The same someone who seemed to know my every move before I made it.

They held me overnight. In the morning, a lawyer I'd never seen before showed up and got me released on my own recognizance—Vernon Shaw's doing, I assumed, though the lawyer wouldn't confirm it. The evidence was circumstantial; I had no motive for killing Novak; and Burke, for all his bluster, knew he didn't have enough for a conviction.

But the damage was done. My name was in the papers now, connected to a murder. The witnesses I'd been trying to re-interview would never talk to me again. The corruption case was effectively dead.

I walked out of the police station into gray February light and tried to think of what came next.

Howard Brennan had disappeared. Gloria Dane had disappeared. Jerry Novak was dead. And I was walking around with a murder charge hanging over my head like a sword on a fraying thread.

Someone was playing a game I didn't understand. Someone who had more power than the Combination, more reach than the police, more patience than any enemy I'd ever faced.

I walked home through streets that felt suddenly foreign, past faces that might have been watching me, under a sky that promised more rain. The pieces of the case lay scattered around me like fragments of a shattered mirror, each one reflecting a different angle of the same truth:

I was losing.

But I wasn't going to stop.

Someone had to give a damn. Even when giving a damn got people killed.

Even when you were the one who was going to die.

The flood lasted five days.

By the end of the first day, the LA River had jumped its banks. The concrete channels that were supposed to contain it proved useless against the volume of water pouring down from the mountains. Whole neighborhoods were underwater. Bridges collapsed—I heard the news on the radio, station after station reporting the same disasters: Lankershim Bridge, gone. Owensmouth, gone. Half a dozen rail lines washed out, telegraph poles down, roads impassable.

I couldn't get to my office. The lower floors of my building were flooded, and even if I could have reached the door, there was nothing there worth saving. Whatever the water hadn't destroyed, the looters would. That's how it worked in this city—disaster wasn't tragedy, just opportunity in a different costume.

I spent the first two days in my room, listening to the radio and drinking what was left of my whiskey. The news was all flood, all the time. Hundred confirmed dead and rising. Thousands homeless. The movie studios had shut down; Hollywood was an island cut off from the rest of the city. Downtown was being evacuated. The National Guard had been called in.

And somewhere beneath all the noise, buried under the catastrophe, the Combination kept operating. I knew it without having to see it. The corrupt machinery of Los Angeles didn't stop for floods. It just adapted.

On the third day, the rain let up enough for me to venture out.

---

The city was unrecognizable.

I walked down Bunker Hill through streets covered in mud and debris. Trees had been uprooted, cars had been overturned, walls of sandbags had failed and been swept away. The air smelled of sewage and rotting vegetation and something else, something sweet and wrong that I didn't want to identify.

I made it to my office building by afternoon. The ground floor was a ruin—mud and water and wreckage piled against the walls, the elevator shaft flooded, the stairs treacherous with slime. But the second floor, where my office was, had been just above the waterline.

What I found there was worse than flooding.

Everything was gone.

Gone rather than destroyed. The filing cabinets stood open and empty. The desk drawers had been pulled out and dumped. My safe, the one they'd already cracked once, had been hauled away entirely, leaving only scrape marks on the floor where it had stood.

I stood in the empty room and felt something shift inside me.

Something deeper than anger or despair. A kind of clarity that came from having lost everything there was to lose.

They had taken it all. The evidence I'd rebuilt, the notes I'd hidden, even the letter I'd written documenting the case—everything. The flood had given them perfect cover. While the city was drowning, they'd come for the last scraps of what I'd built, and they'd erased me as thoroughly as if I'd never existed.

I sat down in my chair—the one piece of furniture they'd left, maybe as a joke—and pulled out my notebook. The one I'd kept in my coat pocket, the one that was still damp from the rain but readable.

It contained maybe a fifth of what I'd known. Names, dates, fragments. Insufficient to make a case or bring down anyone.

But it was something.

I started writing.

---

The reformers called two days later, when the rain had finally stopped and the city was beginning to assess the damage.

Vernon Shaw's voice was different on the phone—older, more tired. "I heard about your office, Malone. I'm sorry."

"Don't be sorry. Be helpful. Are you still pushing the recall?"

A long pause. "The petition is due in two weeks. We have the signatures. But without the evidence you were gathering..."

"Without the evidence, you've got nothing but accusations." I looked at the notebook in my hand. "I can give you what I remember. It won't be enough for a prosecution, but it might be enough to make noise. Get some newspaper coverage. Put pressure on."

"Is that safe for you? After everything that's happened?"

I thought about the murder charge still hanging over my head. About the death threats, the ransacked office, the pattern of destruction that had followed me for months. About my growing certainty that I was not going to survive to see the recall election.

"Safe doesn't matter anymore," I said. "What matters is getting the information out there before they silence everyone who knows it."

Another pause. "All right. Can you come to my home tomorrow? We'll put together what we have and figure out how to use it."

I agreed. We set a time. I hung up the phone and sat in my empty office as the sun set over a city still dripping with flood water, and I wrote down everything I could remember.

---

That night, I went to a bar.

Not The Blue Parrot, not any of the places connected to the case. Just a dive on Alameda Street, the kind of place where nobody asked questions and nobody remembered faces. I sat at the bar and drank whiskey and tried to think about what came next.

The corruption case was dead. The blackmail case was dead. Everyone I'd tried to help was dead or disappeared or pretending I didn't exist. I was a murder suspect, a marked man, a detective with no cases and no prospects and no reason to believe tomorrow would be any better than today.

And yet.

I kept coming back to the same thought, the same phrase that seemed to arise from somewhere deeper than my own mind:

Someone has to give a damn.

Not because it would change anything. The Combination would survive the recall, no matter what evidence came to light. Mayor Shaw might go down, but someone else would take his place. The corruption was too deep, too entrenched, too much a part of what Los Angeles was. You couldn't cut it out any more than you could cut the rot out of a corpse.

But you could try. You could keep trying. You could stand in front of the machine and say, This is wrong, even if saying it got you killed. You could bear witness. You could refuse to look away.

That was worth something. Maybe it was worth everything.

I didn't know where the certainty came from. It felt older than me, older than this life, like an echo from somewhere I'd never been. But it was there, solid as bone, immovable as stone.

I finished my drink, paid my tab, and walked out into a night that smelled of rain and mud and new beginnings.

---

The next morning, I met with Vernon Shaw.

His home was in Hancock Park, a sprawling Spanish Revival that had survived the flood better than most. He looked ten years older than when I'd first met him—the country club tan faded, the confident manner replaced by something grimmer.

We sat in his study and I told him everything I remembered. The payoff structures. The witness statements. The connections between City Hall and the police and the gambling ships. He wrote it down in careful longhand, asking questions when my memory faltered, filling in gaps from his own knowledge.

By the end, we had maybe twenty pages. A map of the corruption rather than a case or proof, but detailed enough that anyone who wanted to follow it could.

"What will you do with it?" I asked.

"There's a reporter at the Herald-Express. Young, ambitious, willing to take on Shaw. I'll give it to him. Let him decide if it's worth the risk."

"And if he publishes?"

Vernon Shaw looked at me with eyes that had seen too much. "Then at least it's out there. At least someone knows. Even if nothing changes, at least the truth is on the record."

I nodded. That was all any of us could hope for. The truth on the record. A marker in the sand, even as the tide came in to wash it away.

"You should leave the city, Malone." Vernon's voice was gentle. "You've done what you can. More than anyone could expect. There's no shame in walking away now."

I thought about it. Thought about getting on a train, heading east or north or anywhere that wasn't Los Angeles. Starting over in a city that didn't know my name or my failures.

"I'm not finished," I said.

"The case is finished. What's left?"

I didn't have an answer. Not one I could put into words. But the thought was still there, that strange certainty that had been growing since the flood:

Someone has to give a damn. Even if it doesn't change anything. Even if it's pointless.

Especially if it's pointless.

"I'll stay," I said. "A little while longer."

Vernon Shaw didn't argue. Maybe he understood. Or maybe he just knew there was no point trying to save a man who didn't want to be saved.

I drove back to Bunker Hill as the sun climbed toward noon. The streets were drying out, the mud hardening into ruts and ridges. The city was already forgetting the flood, already moving on to the next disaster, the next scandal, the next beautiful nightmare.

I parked my Buick in the alley behind my boarding house and climbed the stairs to my room. The door was locked, unchanged. No threatening notes, no evidence of intrusion.

But I knew they were watching. I knew they were waiting.

And I knew, with a certainty that went beyond logic or self-preservation, that I wasn't going to stop.

I didn't think I could win. I didn't believe in justice or redemption or any of the noble abstractions that men used to justify dying.

But someone had to try.

Just because the trying was not nothing.

**Word count: ~1,950**


The last two weeks of my life were strangely peaceful.

Not calm, exactly—there was still work to do, still witnesses to track down, still pages of notes to transcribe and pass along to Shaw's network. But beneath the activity, beneath the fear and the exhaustion, there was something else. A kind of settled certainty that I couldn't quite name.

I woke each morning knowing that it might be my last, and somehow that made each morning clearer. The coffee tasted sharper. The rain on the windows looked more beautiful. The small kindnesses of strangers—a smile from the woman who sold newspapers on the corner, a nod from a fellow rider on Angels Flight—seemed precious in a way they never had before.

I kept a letter in my pocket, updated every few days. Not a confession or a farewell, just an accounting: what I knew, who I'd talked to, what I'd learned. If they found my body, I wanted someone to find the letter too. Wanted the truth to survive even if I didn't.

Someone has to give a damn.

The phrase ran through my head like a mantra now. I didn't know where it came from—didn't remember ever deciding to believe it—but it was there, constant and sure. Not just about the corruption case, not just about Los Angeles. About everything. About the way a man should live, whether he had fifty years left or five days.

You couldn't fix the world. You couldn't save everyone. You couldn't even save yourself.

But you could try. You could keep trying, even when trying was pointless. You could refuse to stop caring, even when caring cost you everything.

That was worth something. Maybe it was worth everything.

---

The morning it happened, I knew.

Not how or when—just that this was the day. I felt it the way you feel a storm coming, a pressure change in the air, a weight against your skin that hasn't quite become rain.

I dressed carefully. Clean shirt, pressed suit, the gray fedora that had seen me through two years of private work and sixteen years on the force before that. I checked my gun—not the Colt, which they'd taken, but a backup piece I'd picked up at a pawnshop, a cheap .32 that would do in a pinch.

Then I sat at my desk and wrote one more letter.

Not to Vernon Shaw. Not to the reporter or the police or anyone who could do anything with the information.

To no one. To whoever might find it. To the universe, maybe, if the universe was listening.

*I don't know who will read this, or if anyone will. But I want to say something before I go.*

*I've been a cop and a soldier and a private detective. I've seen people at their worst and, occasionally, at their best. I've failed more cases than I've solved, lost more fights than I've won. I'm going to die today, probably, and when I do, the corruption I've been fighting will still be standing. Nothing I've done will change that.*

*But here's what I've learned, in these last few weeks, as everything fell apart:*

*The trying matters. Not because it succeeds. Not because it changes anything. Just because someone has to try. Someone has to look at what's wrong and say it's wrong, even if saying it gets you killed. Someone has to give a damn, even when giving a damn is pointless.*

*I didn't save anyone. Every case I worked this year went south. Every witness I tried to protect ended up dead or running. I'm going to die with nothing to show for any of it.*

*But the trying was not nothing.*

*I don't know why that feels true. It feels older than me, deeper than anything I could have figured out on my own. Like an echo from somewhere I've never been. Like a promise I made a long time ago and don't remember making.*

*Whoever you are, wherever you are: keep trying. Even when it's pointless. Especially when it's pointless.*

*Someone has to give a damn.*

*Someone will.*

I folded the letter and put it in my inside coat pocket, next to my heart.

Then I went downstairs to get my car.

---

The Buick Roadmaster was parked in the alley behind the boarding house, where it had been for three days. I hadn't driven it since the flood—hadn't needed to, hadn't wanted to. But today I was going to meet Vernon Shaw one last time, to hand over the final batch of notes, and the streetcar wouldn't get me there fast enough.

The rain had started again. Not hard, just a steady drizzle that made the world look like it was crying. I pulled my hat down and my collar up and walked through the mud to where the Buick sat waiting.

It was a beautiful car, even now. Three years old, but I'd kept it polished, kept the chrome shining. The rain beaded on the black hood like tears on a mourner's cheek. I'd bought it from a widow on Hope Street, a woman whose husband had died and left her nothing but debts and this one extravagance. She'd needed the money. I'd needed the car. Los Angeles, making trades.

I unlocked the door and slid behind the wheel.

The interior smelled of old leather and cigarettes and the faint mustiness of a car that had been sitting too long. The seat creaked as I settled into it. The steering wheel was cold under my hands.

I looked out the windshield at the rain falling on the alley, at the back of the boarding house, at the gray morning light that seemed to promise nothing good.

And then I saw her.

She was standing on the sidewalk at the end of the alley, near where it opened onto Hill Street. A woman in a dark coat, dark hair visible under the brim of a fashionable hat. She was looking at me.

The same woman. The one from the bar, from the street corner. The one who kept appearing and disappearing like a ghost.

This time, I could see her face clearly. The sharp widow's peak. The single darker strand that fell across her forehead despite the rain. Her eyes, fixed on mine across fifty feet of wet pavement—and in one of them, the left one, something strange. A flicker of color that didn't belong. Green, maybe, a pale crescent of green in an iris that should have been brown.

She knew.

I don't know how I knew she knew, but I did. She was waiting for something. Watching for something. And whatever it was, it was about to happen.

Our eyes held for one long moment. Then she started to move—not toward me, but away, turning, beginning to walk quickly down the sidewalk, as if she could see what was coming and wanted to be gone before it arrived.

A passerby, rushing to avoid.

I turned the key.

---

The world became light.

I don't remember the sound—the detonation was too close, too sudden, for my ears to process as noise. Just brightness, overwhelming, filling my vision like a second sun had been born beneath the hood of my car. Then pressure, a wave of force that picked me up and threw me somewhere I couldn't track.

Then pain.

I was lying on the pavement. I knew that without opening my eyes. Wet and cold and hard beneath my back, rain falling on my face. The Buick was burning—I could hear it now, a crackling roar, could smell the gasoline and rubber and metal turning to smoke.

I tried to move. My body responded wrong, signals scrambling, limbs not finding their proper places. Something was broken in my chest. Something was bleeding, a lot, warm and wet mixing with the rain.

I opened my eyes.

The sky was gray. The rain fell straight down, each drop hitting my face like a tiny cold finger. I could see the flames from the car, orange and yellow against the gray, throwing shadows that danced on the walls of the alley.

Footsteps. Someone running toward me, then stopping. A face above me—not the woman, someone else, a stranger, eyes wide with shock.

"Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. Someone call an ambulance!"

The face disappeared. More footsteps, more voices. The sounds of a city reacting to violence, the same sounds I'd heard a hundred times as a cop. Sirens in the distance, getting closer or maybe just imagined.

I lay on the pavement and looked at the sky and felt my life leaving me.

---

The pain was fading.

That was the first sign, the one I recognized from the war—the way bad wounds stop hurting when there's not enough blood left to carry the signals. My body was shutting down, system by system, conserving what little it had for the parts that still needed to work.

My eyes still worked. I could see the rain. Could see the flames dying as someone threw a blanket over the burning car. Could see shapes moving at the edge of my vision, people gathering, the audience that always appears when someone dies in public.

And at the edge of the crowd, standing apart, the woman.

She hadn't left. She was watching me from the sidewalk, her face unreadable, her strange eyes fixed on mine. There was something in her expression—not satisfaction, not grief, something else. Recognition, maybe. Or understanding.

She knew who I was. Not just Jack Malone, private detective. Something else. Something older.

The thought should have frightened me, but I was beyond fear now. Beyond everything except this moment, this rain, this slow departure.

I closed my eyes.

---

In the darkness behind my eyelids, something shifted.

Not memory, exactly. Deeper than memory. A sense of vastness, of connection, of threads running backward through time to places I couldn't name but somehow knew.

Other lives. Other deaths. Other hands reaching out in the final moments, grasping for something they couldn't find.

I saw a temple floor, stone cold beneath a dying man's back. I saw a battlefield, mud and blood and the screams of the wounded. I saw a plague city, a desert cave, a philosopher's cell, a palace chamber, a ship in a storm. I saw lives stacked upon lives, deaths upon deaths, the same soul learning the same lessons in a thousand different bodies.

And I understood.

Not the details—those were beyond me, fading even as they appeared. But the shape of it. The pattern.

I'd been trying for a long time. Longer than this life, longer than I could imagine. Trying to help, trying to fix, trying to make things right in worlds that resisted being fixed. And failing. Always failing. Every life, every effort, ending in death and defeat and the certainty that nothing had changed.

But the trying mattered.

That was the lesson. The one I'd been learning since before I could remember. Not that you could succeed—success was an illusion, a horizon that receded as you approached. But that the effort itself had weight. Had meaning. Had value beyond any outcome it might achieve.

The trying was not nothing.

I felt something loosen in my chest. Not the broken ribs, not the collapsing lungs. Something else. A chain I'd been carrying so long I'd forgotten it was there. The need to be the one who fixed things, saved things, made the difference—a grip I'd held so tight my fingers had gone numb.

The chain of identity. The belief that there was a "me" separate from the trying, a self that needed to be preserved and protected and proven right.

It was loosening. Almost breaking. One more push, one more life, and it would snap.

And then—

What? I didn't know. Couldn't know. But I could feel it waiting, just beyond the edge of this life, a door that had been locked for ages and was finally coming open.

I will try again.

The thought arose without effort, without decision. A promise to something I couldn't name. A commitment that went beyond this body, this life, this death.

I will try again. I will keep trying. And someday—soon—the trying will finally be enough.

---

The rain fell on my face like baptism.

My blood was spreading on the pavement, mixing with the water, washing away. I could feel myself getting lighter, the weight of the body becoming irrelevant, the pain fading into a kind of distant music.

Voices above me, urgent, meaningless. Sirens getting closer. Someone was pressing something against my chest, trying to stop the bleeding, but it was too late for that. I'd been a cop long enough to know a fatal wound when I felt one.

I opened my eyes one last time.

The woman was still there. Still watching. But she was further away now, or maybe I was further away. She was receding into the rain, into the gray, her face becoming less distinct, her eyes fading from strange to ordinary to invisible.

A passerby. A witness. Nothing more.

But she knew. And I knew. And in that knowing was something that mattered more than all the evidence I'd gathered, all the cases I'd failed, all the people I hadn't managed to save.

The trying was not nothing.

I didn't save anyone. The Combination would survive. The corruption would continue. Nothing I did made any difference at all.

But the trying was not nothing.

I closed my eyes.

The rain kept falling. The sirens arrived. The crowd pressed closer, and somewhere in the noise and chaos, Jack Malone, age thirty-eight, private detective, stopped breathing.

---

The body lay on the wet pavement for a long time after that.

The ambulance came and went—there was nothing to be done, the medics said, he was gone before they arrived. The police came too, taking photographs, making notes, treating it as what it obviously was: another car bombing in a city that had seen too many. The reporter from the Herald-Express showed up, asked a few questions, wrote a story that would run on page eight the next morning.

The rain kept falling.

And somewhere else—somewhere that had no name, no location, no existence in any geography the living could map—something stirred.

A momentum that had been building for millennia. A pattern that had been waiting for completion. Lifetimes of failure that were also preparation. Fires that had refined instead of destroyed.

And now, finally: the urge that would carry forward into the next life. The certainty that the trying mattered. The readiness to break the chains that remained.

Someone has to give a damn.

I will try again.

The rain fell on the empty body. The city went on with its business. The corruption continued and the corrupt prospered and nothing changed.

But somewhere, in a way that no one in Los Angeles would ever understand, everything had changed.

The wheel turned.

A new life began.
