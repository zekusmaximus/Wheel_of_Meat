# Scene 1: The Hangover

I woke with the taste of failure in my mouth.

The rye had gone sour sometime during the night, mixing with the copper aftertaste of the blood I'd bitten from my cheek while sleeping. My tongue found the wound—small, raw, already scabbing. Another dreamless night of grinding my teeth through whatever my mind was trying to forget.

Gray light leaked through the gap in the curtains. Morning, probably. The radiator had quit again, leaving the room cold enough that my breath made small ghosts in the air above the pillow. I watched them rise and dissolve, postponing the moment when I'd have to swing my legs over the edge of the Murphy bed and face another day of being Jack Malone, private investigator, thirty-eight years old and running out of reasons to keep the title.

The ceiling had a new crack. Water damage from the storms last week, working its way through the old Victorian bones of this Bunker Hill boarding house. Mrs. Patterson would want someone to look at it. She wouldn't pay to have it fixed. The crack would spread, and eventually the ceiling would come down, and that would be that. Everything in this city was rotting from the inside out. You just had to decide how long you wanted to watch.

I sat up.

The room came into focus in pieces: the hot plate on the dresser with yesterday's coffee still in the pot, a skin of oil floating on top; the single wooden chair with my trousers draped over it, wrinkled beyond what any iron could fix; the washstand with its chipped basin and the mirror above it, which I made a point of not looking into before noon. The mirror showed things a man didn't need to see at this hour. How the gray had spread from his temples into the hair above his ears. How the lines around his eyes had stopped being character and started being age. How he looked, more and more, like his father had looked in the last years—hollow and waiting.

I rubbed my jaw, feeling the stubble rasp against my palm. Two days' growth, maybe three. I'd stopped counting.

The smell hit me when I stood: yesterday's cigarettes, the rye I'd spilled on the floor beside the bed, the general funk of a room that hadn't seen fresh air since Roosevelt's first term. Through it all, coming up from the street three floors below, the wet concrete smell that meant the rain had stopped overnight. Los Angeles in January. The city couldn't decide if it wanted to drown or burn.

I crossed to the window and pulled back the curtain.

Bunker Hill spread out below me in the early light, beautiful in the way a corpse is beautiful before it starts to rot. The old Victorian mansions climbed the slope like monuments to dead money, their painted ladies now carved up into boarding rooms and flophouses for people who couldn't afford the flatlands. Angels Flight sat halfway down the hill, its two orange cars frozen on their tracks, waiting for the first fare of the day. Beyond that, downtown Los Angeles gleamed in the distance—the Eastern Columbia Building, the City Hall tower, the movie palaces along Broadway. From up here, you couldn't see the breadlines. Couldn't smell the desperation that hung over Fifth Street like fog. Couldn't hear the police sirens that had become as common as birdsong in a city that had sold its soul to the Combination and called it progress.

I turned away from the window.

The newspaper was still on the floor where I'd thrown it last night, and for a moment I saw the headline again without having to pick it up: RAYMOND BOMBING WITNESS RECANTS. Two weeks since someone had wired a car bomb to former detective Harry Raymond's Buick, and the city was already forgetting. The witnesses who'd identified the cops involved were changing their stories. The investigation was going nowhere. Captain Earle Kynette and his Spy Squad would walk, and everyone who mattered would learn the lesson: don't investigate the Combination unless you want to die in a ball of fire.

I'd known Harry. Not well—we'd crossed paths a few times when I was still on the force, back when I thought being a good cop meant something. He'd been building a case against Mayor Shaw's machine, documenting the payoffs, the protection rackets, the straight line that ran from City Hall to the mob. Now he was in a hospital bed learning to breathe around the shrapnel in his lungs, and the men who'd tried to kill him were still drawing their city paychecks.

Twelve dollars.

That was what I had. Twelve dollars in the coffee can on top of the icebox, and rent due in three days. Six dollars a week for this palace of rot and radiator failure. Mrs. Patterson had already extended me once, after the Henderson divorce fell through. She wasn't the extending type.

I found my shirt on the floor, pulled it on, decided the tie could wait. The Colt Detective Special went into the shoulder holster—force of habit, though I hadn't fired it in anger since quitting the department two years ago. The trench coat covered the gun and most of the wrinkles. The fedora covered my hair, which had given up any pretense of cooperation.

The coffee was cold and bitter, but I drank it anyway, standing at the window, watching Angels Flight start its first run of the day. Five cents to ride down the hill to my office. Five cents more to ride back up tonight, if I could find five cents and a reason to come back.

Six months.

That's how long it had been since a case went right. The Delacroix missing person—found the man, turns out he didn't want to be found, turned out his wife didn't want him found once she saw what he'd been doing, turned out nobody wanted to pay me once the truth came out. The Kimball blackmail job—identified the blackmailer, client decided to pay instead of prosecute, blackmailer walked with the money and a smile. The Fontaine insurance fraud—had the proof, DA's office sat on it, eventually lost the file, case dismissed. One after another, month after month. Good work going nowhere. Results that turned to ash the moment I tried to hold them.

I'd started to think it was me. That I'd lost whatever edge I'd had as a cop. That the drink was finally catching up, or the sleepless nights, or just the accumulation of years in a city that ground down anyone who tried to stay clean.

What I didn't know—what I couldn't have known—was that none of it was accident. Somewhere, someone was making sure my cases failed. Making sure the witnesses recanted and the evidence disappeared and the clients backed out. Setting me up for something I couldn't see coming.

But that's not how it felt that January morning. That morning, standing in my cold room with bad coffee and twelve dollars and a headline about a good cop who'd gotten too close to the truth, it just felt like Los Angeles. It just felt like being Jack Malone.

I rinsed the coffee cup, left it in the basin, and headed for the door.

Angels Flight was running by the time I reached the top of the incline. The car named Sinai was waiting, its wooden benches empty except for an old Mexican woman with a basket of tamales she was probably taking down to sell on Spring Street. I dropped my nickel in the slot and took a seat near the front, watching the city rise up to meet me as we descended.

The woman was praying quietly, her lips moving over words I couldn't hear. Rosary beads clicked between her fingers, small and worn. She looked at me once, saw what I was—the rumpled coat, the unshaven face, the exhaustion that had become permanent—and went back to her prayers. I didn't blame her. If I believed in anything worth praying to, I'd have been doing the same.

The car reached the bottom of the hill, and I stepped out onto Hill Street, into the morning light and the sound of traffic and the smell of exhaust mixing with bacon from the diner across the way. My office was four blocks north, on the second floor of a building that had been grand once and was now merely standing. The elevator hadn't worked since Hoover was president. The stairs creaked in places that changed week to week, the building settling into its own slow collapse.

The frosted glass door still said JACK MALONE – PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS, which was optimistic of it. I unlocked the door and stepped inside, and that's when I saw them.

Two men, waiting.

They rose from the client chairs as I entered, and everything about them said trouble. Good suits—too good for Bunker Hill—and the careful, watchful manner of men who were used to being careful and watchful. The older one was fifty, maybe, with silver hair and the kind of tan you get from country club golf, not honest labor. The younger one was thirty, carrying a briefcase like it contained something that might explode.

"Mr. Malone." The older one extended his hand. His grip was firm, practiced. "I apologize for letting ourselves in. Your door was unlocked."

It hadn't been. I always locked it. But I wasn't going to argue with men in suits that cost more than my monthly rent.

"What can I do for you gentlemen?"

They looked at each other. The younger one set his briefcase on my desk, unopened.

"We'd like to hire you," the older one said. "To do something very dangerous, for very good money."

Outside, the sounds of the city continued—cars and streetcars and the distant wail of a siren, someone else's emergency, someone else's problem. I looked at the briefcase, then at the two men who'd come with it.

Rent was due in three days. Twelve dollars wouldn't cover it.

I should have told them no.

"I'm listening," I said.

# Scene 2: The Offer

I hung my coat on the rack by the door and crossed to my desk, taking my time. The Venetian blinds were crooked—someone had touched them—and the filing cabinet drawer wasn't quite closed, a quarter inch of gap that hadn't been there yesterday. These men had been through my things. Not finding anything, because there was nothing to find, but looking.

"Sit down," I said, settling into my own chair. It squeaked, as it always did, a sound that had become so familiar I barely noticed it anymore. "And tell me why two men who could afford lawyers are slumming in a Bunker Hill detective agency."

The older one smiled, but not with his eyes. He took the chair across from me, folding one leg over the other with the ease of a man who'd never worried about creasing his trousers. The younger one remained standing by the window, the briefcase back in his hands.

"My name is Vernon Shaw." The older one let the name hang there, watching for a reaction. "And before you ask—no, not that Shaw. A distant relation, and not a proud one."

Mayor Frank Shaw. The Combination's pet politician, the man who'd turned Los Angeles into a vending machine where every service had its price and the machine was always broken. I kept my face blank.

"Go on."

"I'm part of a... concerned citizens' group." Vernon Shaw chose his words like a man picking through broken glass. "We believe the current city administration has exceeded the bounds of acceptable corruption. The Raymond bombing was the final straw. We're organizing a recall effort, Mr. Malone. Signatures are being gathered as we speak."

I'd heard the rumors. Half the reform-minded people in Los Angeles had heard them. A recall petition against a sitting mayor—the first in American history for a city this size. It sounded noble. It also sounded suicidal.

"You want to take down Frank Shaw," I said. "With petitions."

"With evidence." Vernon leaned forward, and for the first time I saw something behind the country club polish—his jaw tight, a vein pulsing at his temple. "The petition gets us on the ballot. But to win the recall, we need to show the public exactly what's been happening. The payoffs, the protection rackets, the Spy Squad operations. We need documentation that the newspapers can print and the voters can see."

"You need someone to do what Harry Raymond was doing. Before someone wired his car."

The younger man flinched. Vernon didn't.

"We're aware of the risks, Mr. Malone. That's why we're coming to you instead of one of the large agencies. You have a reputation for honesty. For not being buyable. For having left the LAPD rather than participate in cover-ups." He paused. "We did our research."

I thought about the twelve dollars in my coffee can. About the rent due in three days. About six months of failed cases and the slow grinding certainty that I was becoming irrelevant.

"You know what happened to Raymond," I said. "You know what happens to anyone who gets too close to the Combination. Why would I be any different?"

"Because you're already close." Vernon nodded at the filing cabinet with its gap-drawer, the blinds that had been touched. "Your name is on a list, Mr. Malone. The Spy Squad has been monitoring you since you left the force. Probably before. Captain Kynette considers ex-cops who didn't take the buyout to be potential whistleblowers. You're already in danger. The only question is whether you want to be in danger for nothing or for something."

I rubbed my jaw, feeling the stubble catch against my palm. It was a habit I'd picked up somewhere—couldn't remember when—this gesture of thinking, of buying time when time was the only thing I had to spend.

"What exactly do you want me to do?"

The younger man stepped forward and set the briefcase on my desk. He clicked it open. Inside: a manila folder, thick with papers, and underneath it, banded stacks of bills. More money than I'd seen in one place since I'd quit the force.

"Retainer," Vernon said. "Two hundred dollars. Twenty-five a day plus expenses after that, for as long as the investigation takes. The folder contains what we already have—names, dates, suspicious transactions. We need someone to verify, to add to it, to build the kind of case that can't be buried. Someone who knows how the police work, how the courts work, how the Combination protects itself."

I didn't touch the money. Not yet.

"Who else knows about this? Your 'concerned citizens' group?"

"A dozen people. Business owners, mostly. A few ministers. One or two sympathetic journalists. All of them have families, reputations, reasons not to be identified publicly until we're ready. If this fails, the Combination will destroy them."

"And if it fails, I'll be dead."

Vernon Shaw met my eyes. "Yes. Probably. Is that a reason not to try?"

Outside, I could hear the streetcar rattling past on Hill Street, the clang of its bell mixing with the rumble of automobiles and the distant sound of construction somewhere downtown. The city going about its business, buying and selling and making deals and pretending none of it was built on a foundation of blood and graft.

I thought about Harry Raymond, lying in a hospital bed, his lungs full of shrapnel.

I thought about the headline that morning: WITNESS RECANTS.

I thought about the twelve dollars in my coffee can, and the six months of failed cases, and the slow certainty that I was disappearing into irrelevance.

And underneath all of that, somewhere deeper than I could name, I thought about the simple fact that someone had to give a damn. Someone had to look at the rot and say it was rot, even if saying it got you killed. Someone had to try.

I didn't know where that thought came from—that compulsion to keep pushing against walls that wouldn't move. It felt older than me, older than this life, like an echo from somewhere I couldn't remember. But it was there, and it was strong, and it was the only thing that had ever felt like truth.

"You know what you're asking," I said. "You're asking me to paint a target on my chest and walk through a shooting gallery."

"We're asking you to help us take back our city."

"Same thing."

I looked at the money in the briefcase. At the folder full of names and dates and promises. At Vernon Shaw with his country club tan and his hard-set jaw, and the younger man who was probably someone's son or brother, standing there with white knuckles on the briefcase handle and sweat beading at his hairline.

I should have said no. Every instinct I'd developed in sixteen years as a cop and two years as a private detective was screaming that this was how men died—with good intentions and bad odds and a file full of evidence that would never see the light of day.

Instead, I reached into the briefcase and pulled out the folder.

"Tell me about these names."

Vernon Shaw exhaled—relief, or maybe just the release of tension he'd been holding since he walked in. The younger man's shoulders dropped an inch.

"The first section covers the payoff structure," Vernon began, leaning forward. "Shaw—Mayor Shaw—operates through intermediaries. His brother Joe handles most of the direct collections. Chief Davis provides the enforcement arm through the Spy Squad and the Gun Squad. The money flows up through a series of front businesses, mostly bars and gambling operations that are technically illegal but operate openly under police protection."

I opened the folder and started reading. Names I recognized, some of them. Aldermen and police captains and businessmen who showed up in the society pages with their wives at charity events. Numbers beside the names—payments, mostly, regular as clockwork. Five hundred here, a thousand there. Small amounts that added up to a fortune.

"This is circumstantial," I said. "Accounting records can be explained away. You need testimony."

"We have names." Vernon pointed to a page near the back. "People who've seen things, done things, want to talk. They're scared, obviously. The Raymond bombing made them more scared. But some of them are willing, if they can be assured of protection."

I looked at the list. A dozen names, with addresses and occupations. A city clerk. A police secretary. A bartender at one of the Combination's protected joints. Small people, caught in a big machine, hoping someone would help them get out.

"You want me to interview these people. Get their statements on record."

"Document everything. Build the case. When we have enough—when it's airtight—we go to the newspapers. Not the Times, they're in Shaw's pocket. But there are reform papers, out-of-town stringers who'd love to break this story. Once it's public, once the voters can see what's been happening, the recall becomes a matter of civic duty."

"And until then, I'm the only one connecting you to any of this."

"Yes."

I closed the folder. Looked at the money again. Two hundred dollars. More than three months' rent. More than I'd made in the last two months combined.

"The witness list," I said. "Some of these people are going to get cold feet once I start asking questions. Some of them are going to be compromised—Combination plants, or people who'll run to the cops the moment I leave. You understand that?"

"We understand."

"And when the Spy Squad figures out what I'm doing—and they will figure it out—they're going to come for me. They might come for your concerned citizens too. Are your ministers and businessmen ready for that?"

Vernon Shaw's jaw tightened. "We're prepared for casualties. We've all made peace with what this might cost."

It was the right answer, and it was probably a lie. Nobody was ever really prepared for casualties. Not until the casualties happened.

But he believed he meant it. That was something.

I picked up the folder and slid it into my desk drawer. Then I reached into the briefcase and took out the money—all of it, the banded stacks of twenties and tens and fives.

"I'll need a week to work through the initial list," I said. "Longer if people start disappearing or changing their stories. You'll hear from me when I have something concrete."

Vernon Shaw stood, extending his hand again. "Thank you, Mr. Malone. You won't regret this."

I shook his hand. The younger man gathered the empty briefcase and followed Vernon to the door.

"Mr. Shaw." They both turned. I was still sitting at my desk, the folder in the drawer, the money in my hand. "You should know why I'm taking this case."

"I assumed it was the money."

"The money helps." I set the bills down on the desk. "But the truth is, someone has to give a damn. Even if it doesn't matter. Even if it gets me killed. Someone has to look at the rot and call it rot. I quit the force because I couldn't stomach being part of the cover-up. This is the same thing. Just a different angle."

Vernon Shaw studied me for a long moment. Whatever he saw seemed to satisfy him.

"That's exactly what we were hoping to hear," he said. "Good luck, Mr. Malone."

They left. The frosted glass door swung shut behind them, and I was alone in my office with two hundred dollars and a list of names and the growing certainty that I'd just signed my own death warrant.

But somewhere beneath the certainty—beneath the fear and the pragmatic calculation—there was something else. Something that felt almost like relief. Six months of failed cases, and now I had a case that mattered. A case worth failing at.

I put the money in the safe, locked the drawer with the folder inside, and lit a cigarette.

Outside, the city kept moving. The Combination kept operating. The corruption kept flowing through Los Angeles like blood through a body too sick to heal.

But somewhere, a clock was ticking. And I was finally doing something worth dying for.

# Scene 3: First Blood

The first week went better than I had any right to expect.

I started with the soft targets—the clerk, the bartender, the secretary. People who worked at the edges of the Combination's operations, who saw enough to be useful but weren't important enough to be protected. The clerk, a thin-faced little man named Doyle who worked in the assessor's office and couldn't stop drumming his fingers on the table, gave me a two-hour deposition about property transfers that had gone through his desk without proper documentation. The bartender—Muñoz, at a place called The Blue Parrot on Main Street—confirmed protection payments that matched the numbers in Vernon Shaw's folder. The secretary, Helen Marsh, had worked in Chief Davis's outer office for three years before transferring to a safer posting in the Parks Department. She knew things. She wanted to tell them.

I wrote everything down. Names, dates, amounts. The web of connections between City Hall and the police and the gambling operations and the floating casinos anchored off Santa Monica. Each interview confirmed something from the folder, added something new, pointed me toward another thread I hadn't known existed.

By the end of the week, I had enough material to fill a second folder. Enough to make the recall case stronger. Enough to make me a legitimate threat.

And that's when the other case walked through my door.

---

Her name was Margaret Sinclair, and she was the wrong kind of beautiful for a detective agency on Bunker Hill. Blonde hair waved like they did it in the pictures, a face that belonged on a movie poster, and clothes that cost more than my monthly rent. She sat in the client chair and twisted her gloves in her hands, and everything about her screamed money looking for trouble.

"My husband," she said. "Frank. He's been missing for three days."

I leaned back in my chair. "Have you talked to the police?"

"The police told me to wait. Said men go missing all the time, most of them turn up." Her voice cracked on the last word. "But Frank wouldn't do this. He wouldn't leave without telling me. Something's wrong."

I should have turned her away. The corruption case was taking all my time, and missing persons work is unpredictable—could be wrapped up in an afternoon, could drag on for weeks. But she was sitting there with tears threatening to spill from eyes the color of summer sky, and Frank Sinclair was someone's husband, and someone had to give a damn.

"Tell me about him," I said.

Frank Sinclair was an accountant. Forty-two years old, worked for a shipping firm downtown. No debts, no vices, no enemies that Margaret knew of. They'd been married fifteen years, no children. Frank left for work Tuesday morning like always. Never came home.

"I've called his office," she said. "They say he left at five o'clock, same as usual. But he drives, Mr. Malone, and his car was still in the parking structure when I went to look. Just sitting there. His briefcase was inside, his lunch pail. Everything except Frank."

I took notes. The shipping firm's name—Pacific Coast Transport—rang a faint bell somewhere in my memory, but I couldn't place it. The parking structure was downtown, on Spring Street, near enough to my office that I could walk it.

"Two hundred dollars," I said. "Retainer against twenty-five a day. If I find him fast, I'll refund what I don't use."

She didn't blink. Just opened her purse and counted out the bills with fingers that trembled slightly. I gave her a receipt and told her I'd be in touch.

After she left, I sat at my desk and stared at the notes I'd taken. Something about the case felt wrong—not the case itself, which was straightforward enough, but the timing of it. Six months of failing cases, then Vernon Shaw's reform money, and now a beautiful woman with a missing husband. Three pieces that didn't seem to connect but somehow felt like they should.

I filed the feeling away and went to work.

---

Finding Frank Sinclair took me two days.

He wasn't hard to trace. I started at the parking structure, bribed the attendant for his sign-out log (he hadn't signed out), then worked backward from there. The shipping firm was on a corner of Second Street, a squat brick building with Pacific Coast Transport painted on the windows in letters that had seen better decades. Frank's colleagues remembered him leaving at five. The receptionist had seen him heading toward the parking structure. Nobody remembered anything unusual.

I spent the afternoon canvassing the blocks between the office and the garage. A shoeshine boy remembered a man matching Frank's description talking to another man on the corner of Second and Spring, around five-fifteen. They'd gotten into a car together. The shoeshine boy hadn't thought anything of it—businessmen got into cars all the time.

The car was a Packard, dark green, California plates. That narrowed it down to about ten thousand cars in Los Angeles County.

The second day, I got lucky. A beat cop I knew from my time on the force, one of the few who wasn't on the Combination's payroll, remembered a drunk and disorderly call from a flophouse on Fifth Street. The man had been raving about "Frank" and "the shipping company" and "they'll kill us both." The cops had let him sleep it off and released him in the morning.

I found the flophouse. The clerk remembered the drunk—middle-aged, looked like he hadn't eaten in days, kept mumbling about numbers and ledgers. He'd checked out that morning, but the clerk had seen him head south toward the Mission District.

I worked the missions for the rest of the day. The third one, a place called Saint Vincent's, had given a meal to a man matching the description. He'd told the volunteer his name was Eddie Garza, and he was hiding from people who wanted to hurt him.

Eddie Garza. I knew that name. It was on Vernon Shaw's list—a bookkeeper who'd worked for one of the Combination's front businesses before having a crisis of conscience. He'd been scheduled for an interview next week.

The connection clicked into place like a key finding its lock.

Frank Sinclair, accountant for a shipping company. Eddie Garza, bookkeeper for the mob. Both men who worked with numbers, both men who'd seen things they shouldn't have seen. The shipping company—Pacific Coast Transport—I remembered now where I'd heard the name. It was in the folder. One of the businesses suspected of laundering Combination money.

Frank Sinclair hadn't gone missing. He'd run. And Eddie Garza was running too, from the same people, for the same reasons.

I found Eddie Garza in an alley behind a Chinese restaurant on Alameda Street, huddled against a dumpster with a bottle of rotgut whiskey clutched in his hand. He was a small man, Hispanic, maybe fifty, with the hollow eyes and shaking hands of someone who'd stopped sleeping weeks ago.

"You Malone?" He looked up at me without surprise, as if he'd been expecting someone like me to find him eventually. "Frank said you might come."

"Frank Sinclair?"

"We were going to the reformers together. Had it all planned. The ledgers, the names, everything. Then they found out." He took a long pull from the bottle. "I don't know how, but they found out. Frank went to get his car and never came back."

"Where is he now?"

Eddie Garza's eyes went flat. "You haven't heard?"

A cold weight settled in my stomach. "Heard what?"

"They found him this morning. In an alley off Sixth Street." Eddie's voice dropped to a whisper. "Cops are calling it a robbery gone wrong. But there wasn't any robbery, Malone. They beat him and they killed him and they left him in the trash like garbage."

---

I called Margaret Sinclair from a payphone on Spring Street.

The conversation lasted three minutes. I told her I'd found her husband. I told her where the body was. I told her I was sorry. She made a sound on the other end of the line that wasn't quite a scream and wasn't quite a sob, and then she hung up.

I stood in the phone booth for a long time after that, listening to the dial tone. Thinking about Frank Sinclair, who'd seen something wrong and tried to do something right, and died in an alley for his trouble. Thinking about Eddie Garza, shaking in that alley, waiting for his turn.

Thinking about the fact that I'd found Frank Sinclair in two days, and it hadn't made a damn bit of difference.

When I went to the police station to file my report, the desk sergeant looked at me like I was something he'd scraped off his shoe.

"Sinclair case?" He didn't bother checking his notes. "Robbery homicide. Case closed."

"He was a witness in a corruption investigation. He was—"

"Case closed, Malone." The sergeant's voice went cold. "Unless you want to make a statement about your own involvement in whatever got him killed."

I left.

The next morning, Margaret Sinclair called my office. Her voice was different now—flat, controlled, empty of everything that had made her seem human two days ago.

"I never hired you, Mr. Malone."

"Ma'am—"

"I never hired you. I don't know who you are. Please don't contact me again."

The line went dead.

---

That afternoon, I sat in a bar on Main Street and tried to make sense of what had happened. The corruption case was still alive—none of my witnesses had recanted yet, none of the evidence had disappeared. But Frank Sinclair was dead, Margaret Sinclair had erased me from her memory, and Eddie Garza had vanished from the alley where I'd found him, leaving nothing behind but an empty whiskey bottle and a bloodstain that might have been his or might have been someone else's.

The bar was dim and smoky, the kind of place where people came to disappear for a few hours. I was working on my second rye when I noticed her.

She was sitting in a booth across the room. Dark hair styled in victory rolls, a dress that caught what little light there was in the place. Beautiful, in a way that made you want to look twice, then look away, then look back again. Her face was angled toward the window, but I could see the sharp line of her widow's peak, the single darker strand that fell across her forehead.

Something about her tugged at my attention. Not attraction—or not just attraction. Something else. A sense of recognition I couldn't place, like seeing a face in a dream and knowing it means something without knowing what.

I watched her for a long moment. She didn't look at me. Didn't seem to notice I was there at all. She was watching the street outside, her expression unreadable, her hands wrapped around a glass she hadn't touched.

Then someone walked between us—another patron heading for the bar—and when the sightline cleared, she was gone. The booth was empty. The glass sat on the table, still full, condensation running down its sides.

I hadn't seen her leave.

I paid for my drinks and went back to my office, the image of her face lodged somewhere behind my eyes like a splinter I couldn't quite reach.

---

The corruption case moved forward. I interviewed three more witnesses that week. Got solid statements from two of them. The third—a police sergeant who'd been willing to talk about payoff schedules—called me the morning of our meeting to say he'd changed his mind.

"Sorry, Malone. Can't do it. Just... can't."

He hung up before I could ask what had changed.

But the other interviews were good. The evidence was building. Vernon Shaw called to check in, and I told him we were making progress, and he sounded pleased.

I didn't tell him about Frank Sinclair. About the missing person case that had turned into a murder I couldn't solve and a wife who'd pretended I didn't exist. About the police sergeant who'd changed his mind for reasons he couldn't or wouldn't explain.

I didn't tell him about the woman in the bar, either. The one who'd disappeared without leaving.

Some things don't fit into reports. Some things you file away and try not to think about until they make sense.

Frank Sinclair's body was released to his wife three days later. The funeral was small—just Margaret and a few family members, standing in the rain at Forest Lawn while a minister said words that didn't mean anything. I watched from a distance, standing under a tree at the edge of the cemetery, and wondered if I should have refused the case. If Frank would still be alive if I'd never started looking for him.

The answer was no, probably. He'd been marked the moment he decided to talk. But the wondering was there anyway, a weight I couldn't put down.

Someone had to give a damn.

Even when giving a damn got people killed.

# Scene 4: Gathering Evidence

February came in gray and wet.

The rain started on the first of the month and didn't quit. Not the heavy downpours that would come later—just a constant drizzle, a fine mist that worked its way into everything: clothes, buildings, bones. The streets of Los Angeles turned slick and treacherous. The gutters ran brown with mud from the hills. Angels Flight's cables groaned and creaked in the damp, and the old Victorian mansions on Bunker Hill seemed to sag a little more each day, as if the weight of the water was finally too much for them to bear.

I worked through it. Rode the funicular down each morning with my collar turned up and my hat pulled low. Interviewed witnesses in coffee shops and back rooms and once, memorably, in a mausoleum at Hollywood Forever Cemetery, where an accountant named Williams—his hands shaking so badly he couldn't light his own cigarette—had insisted we meet because "the dead don't talk."

The case was building. I could feel it taking shape, layer by layer, like sediment accumulating at the bottom of a river. Each witness added something. Each document confirmed another connection. The web of corruption that ran through Los Angeles—from City Hall to the police to the gambling ships anchored off the coast—was becoming visible, if you knew where to look.

But the more I uncovered, the more I noticed things going wrong.

---

The first sign was Doyle, the clerk from the assessor's office. He'd been my most reliable source—a man whose hands never stopped moving, but committed. He'd given me two depositions, each one more damning than the last. We had a third meeting scheduled for the second week of February, at a diner on Figueroa where the coffee was terrible and the booths were private.

He didn't show.

I waited an hour, smoking through half a pack of Lucky Strikes, before I gave up and went to his apartment. The landlady told me he'd moved out three days ago. Left in the middle of the night, she said. Didn't leave a forwarding address.

"Did he seem scared?" I asked.

She looked at me like I'd asked if the sun rose in the east. "Mister, everybody in this city is scared. What kind of question is that?"

I tried to find him. Checked the boarding houses, the missions, the bus stations. Doyle had vanished as thoroughly as if he'd never existed. The only trace he left was a gap in my evidence file where his depositions should have been—and when I checked the folder, I found the pages blank. Water damage, maybe, or some chemical process I didn't understand. The ink had simply... disappeared.

---

The second sign was Muñoz, the bartender from The Blue Parrot.

He didn't vanish. He recanted.

I found him behind the bar on a Tuesday afternoon, polishing glasses with a rag that had seen better years. When he saw me walk in, his face went pale.

"I can't talk to you."

"We talked before. You gave me a statement—"

"I was drunk." He wouldn't meet my eyes. "I made it up. All of it. I never saw any payoffs, never heard any names. I'm just a bartender, Malone. I pour drinks. That's all."

I leaned on the bar, close enough to smell the fear on him. Sour, chemical, the smell of a man who hadn't slept in days.

"What did they offer you? Money? Or just the promise that they wouldn't kill you?"

For a moment, something flickered in his eyes. Recognition. Anger. The remnant of the man who'd sat across from me in a back booth and told me about protection payments and police visits and the steady corruption that made his business possible.

Then it was gone.

"Get out of my bar, Malone. I don't know you. I never knew you."

---

The third sign was Helen Marsh.

She was dead.

I found out from the newspaper, not the police. A small story buried on page twelve: CITY EMPLOYEE DIES IN AUTO ACCIDENT. Helen Marsh, 34, formerly of the Chief of Police's office, had lost control of her car on Mulholland Drive and plunged two hundred feet into a canyon. The car had burned on impact. The body was badly damaged. The funeral would be private.

I read the story three times, looking for something I could use. There was nothing. Just another death in a city full of them.

But I remembered Helen Marsh. Remembered the way she'd looked when she gave me her statement, the mix of fear and relief, like a woman finally putting down a weight she'd been carrying for too long. She'd been brave. She'd wanted to do the right thing.

And now she was dead in a canyon, and the official story was "auto accident," and nobody would ever prove otherwise.

---

I kept working.

That was the thing about the case, about this city, about the whole rotten mess of it—there was always more work to do. Another witness to interview, another lead to follow, another thread to pull. The losses mounted up, but so did the evidence. I told myself it was a race, and all I had to do was stay ahead.

I photographed documents in courthouse basements when the clerks weren't looking. I bribed a printer at City Hall for copies of internal memos. I spent hours in the morgue at the Los Angeles Times, paging through back issues, connecting dates and names and numbers until the web of corruption was so dense I could barely see through it.

Vernon Shaw checked in weekly. He was pleased with the progress, his voice tightening when we discussed the losses. "We can replace witnesses," he said, though we both knew it wasn't true. "The important thing is the documentation. As long as we have the paper trail, we can make the case."

I didn't tell him about the blank pages in Doyle's file. About the photographs that had developed wrong, showing only shadows where there should have been faces. About the growing sense that something was working against me, something that operated on a level I couldn't understand.

Because if I told him that, I'd have to admit I was starting to believe it. And believing in things you couldn't see was the first step toward madness.

---

The weather broke at the end of the second week—a few days of sunshine that felt like a reprieve. I took the opportunity to drive out to Santa Monica, where one of the Combination's gambling ships, the S.S. Rex, sat anchored three miles offshore, just outside the legal limit.

The Rex was Tony Cornero's operation, the most successful of the floating casinos. Water taxis ferried passengers out from the pier, charging a quarter for the privilege of losing money in international waters. The city couldn't touch it. The state couldn't touch it. Federal agents occasionally made noise about shutting it down, but Cornero had lawyers, and the lawyers had lawyers, and nothing ever happened.

I wasn't trying to shut it down. I just wanted to see how the money moved.

I paid my quarter and rode out with a boatload of tourists and regulars, middle-aged men in suits and women in dresses that sparkled under the afternoon sun. The Rex loomed larger as we approached—a converted cargo ship with three decks of gambling halls, bars, restaurants. A floating city of vice, bobbing gently in the Pacific swell.

Inside, the noise was tremendous. Slot machines churning, dice rattling, the constant murmur of dealers calling numbers and announcing payouts. The carpet was red, the walls were gilt, and the smoke hung in the air thick enough to chew. I walked through the crowds, watching. Learning.

The money flowed like water. Cash to chips, chips to cash, winnings skimmed by the house at every transaction. I counted the staff—dealers, pit bosses, security men—and tried to calculate how much was moving through this room in a single afternoon. Thousands, at least. Maybe tens of thousands. And all of it funneling back to Los Angeles, to the Combination, to Mayor Shaw's pocket through channels so convoluted they might as well have been invisible.

This was what I was fighting. Not a man, not even an organization, but a current. Money flowing downhill, finding the path of least resistance, corrupting everything it touched. You couldn't stop a river by arresting one drop of water.

But you could build a dam. If you had enough evidence. If you had enough time. If you could keep the water from washing you away.

I stayed on the Rex for three hours, watching and taking mental notes. When I caught the water taxi back to shore, the sun was setting over the Pacific, painting the water gold and red, beautiful in the way this city was always beautiful—on the surface, and only on the surface.

---

The ride back to Bunker Hill took an hour in evening traffic. I parked my Buick—a three-year-old Roadmaster I'd bought cheap from a widow who didn't need it anymore—in the alley behind my boarding house and climbed the stairs to my room. The door was unlocked.

I drew my gun before I pushed it open.

The room had been tossed. Not ransacked—nothing was broken, nothing was destroyed—but every drawer had been opened, every pile of papers rifled through, every hiding place I thought I had discovered and examined. My spare suit lay crumpled on the bed. My case files were scattered across the floor. Even the coffee can on top of the icebox had been moved, though the money inside was untouched.

A message.

I stood in the doorway for a long moment, the Colt heavy in my hand, listening for sounds that might indicate whoever had done this was still here. The building creaked and settled. Water dripped somewhere in the walls. Nothing else.

I holstered the gun and walked inside.

They hadn't found anything, because there was nothing to find. The real evidence was in my office safe, not my room. But they knew I existed now. They knew I was looking. They knew where I lived.

The game had changed.

I poured myself a drink from the bottle I kept in my nightstand—the one they hadn't touched, either because they weren't interested or because they wanted me to know they could have—and sat on the edge of my bed, looking at the mess they'd made of my life.

Tomorrow, I would clean this up. Tomorrow, I would keep working. Tomorrow, I would interview more witnesses and gather more evidence and inch closer to a case that might or might not survive long enough to matter.

But tonight, I sat in my ransacked room and drank whiskey and wondered how much longer I had before they stopped sending messages and started sending bullets.

The rain started again sometime after midnight. I heard it on the roof, steady and relentless, the sound of Los Angeles trying to drown itself. The crack in my ceiling had spread another inch. Water would be through before spring.

I finished the drink, lay down on my unmade bed, and closed my eyes.

Someone had to give a damn.

Even when giving a damn might get you killed.

# Scene 5: The Pattern Emerges

The arrests started in the third week of February.

They came for me on a Tuesday, two plainclothes detectives from Central Division who didn't bother showing badges until we were already in the back of their unmarked car. The charge was vagrancy—a bullshit catch-all the LAPD used when they wanted to hold someone without actually having to prove anything.

"You're making a mistake," I said.

The bigger of the two detectives—a thick-necked Irishman named Burke, who I'd worked with briefly back when I was on the force—backhanded me across the mouth. The taste of blood, copper and warm, filled my mouth.

"The mistake was yours, Malone. Sticking your nose where it doesn't belong."

They held me for eighteen hours. No phone call, no lawyer, no explanation beyond Burke's assertion that I was "a known troublemaker" who needed to learn his place. They put me in a holding cell with three drunks and a man who'd been picked up for public indecency, and they left me there while the hours crawled past.

The interrogation came at midnight.

Captain Earle Kynette himself conducted it—the head of the Spy Squad, the man whose unit had wired Harry Raymond's car and nearly killed him. Kynette was slim, dark-haired, with the kind of flat eyes that made you think of a snake deciding whether you were worth the effort of biting.

"You've been busy, Malone." He sat across from me in the interrogation room, the single bare bulb throwing harsh shadows across his face. "Talking to people. Writing things down. Making copies of documents that don't belong to you."

"I'm a private investigator. Investigating is what I do."

"What you're doing is interfering with the efficient operation of city government." He smiled, the expression carrying no warmth. "That's a crime, Malone. Maybe not one that's written down in any law book, but it's a crime all the same."

I said nothing. There was nothing to say.

Kynette leaned forward. "I'm going to give you some advice, because I'm a reasonable man. Walk away. Whatever case you think you're building, whatever evidence you think you have—let it go. Take a vacation. Go somewhere nice, somewhere far away, and stay there until the recall election is over. Do that, and nothing happens to you. Keep going, and..."

He spread his hands, the gesture carrying a world of implied violence.

"I've heard this speech before," I said. "Harry Raymond heard it too. He didn't listen, and someone put a bomb in his car."

"Harry Raymond was a stubborn man." Kynette's smile didn't waver. "Stubborn men don't live long in this town."

They released me at dawn, without charges, without explanation. I walked out of the station into gray morning light and rain that had started sometime during the night. My suit was wrinkled, my face was bruised where Burke had hit me, and my mouth tasted like old blood and bad coffee.

But I was alive. And I wasn't going to quit.

---

While I'd been in custody, someone had visited my office.

They'd been more thorough this time. The filing cabinet stood open, its contents scattered across the floor. The safe—which I'd thought was secure—had been forced open, the door hanging askew. Everything inside was gone: the money Vernon Shaw had given me, the copies of documents, the photographs, the witness statements. Two months of work, vanished.

I stood in the wreckage and felt something cold settle in my chest.

This wasn't just a warning anymore. This was erasure. Someone was trying to unmake my case, piece by piece, as if it had never existed.

The phone rang.

I picked it up without thinking, still staring at the violated safe.

"Malone?" Vernon Shaw's voice, thin and urgent. "I've been trying to reach you. I heard about the arrest—"

"They cleaned me out," I said. "Everything. The documents, the photographs, all of it. Someone broke into my safe while I was in holding."

A long silence on the other end of the line.

"How much do you have left?"

I looked around the office. At the papers scattered on the floor, most of them useless—old case files, receipts, letters from clients who'd moved on or died or simply forgotten I existed. At the empty safe, its interior mocking me with its bareness.

"My notes," I said. "The ones I kept on my person. Maybe a third of what I had. And my memory, for what that's worth."

Another silence. When Vernon spoke again, his voice had changed—harder, with a ragged edge to it.

"We're running out of time, Malone. The recall petition is due next month. If we don't have enough evidence by then—"

"I know."

"Can you rebuild it? The witness statements, the documentation—"

"Some of it. Maybe. If the witnesses are still willing to talk." I rubbed my jaw, the stubble rough against my palm. "Half of them have recanted or disappeared. The ones who are left are scared. After this, they're going to be more scared."

"We have to try."

I closed my eyes. Thought about Harry Raymond, lying in his hospital bed. Thought about Helen Marsh, burning in a canyon. Thought about Doyle and Muñoz and all the others who'd decided that silence was safer than speech.

"Yeah," I said. "We have to try."

---

I left the office and walked.

The rain had stopped, but the streets were still wet, reflecting the gray sky and the neon signs that had started to flicker on even though it was barely noon. I walked without direction, letting my feet carry me while my mind worked through the wreckage of the case.

The pattern was undeniable now. It wasn't just bad luck, wasn't just the normal attrition of a corruption investigation. Someone was actively sabotaging me—someone who knew my moves before I made them, who could reach my witnesses before I did, who could crack my safe and destroy my evidence while I sat helpless in a holding cell.

The Combination was the obvious answer. They had the resources, the reach, the motivation. But the precision of it nagged at me. This wasn't the Combination's usual style—they preferred blunt force, intimidation, bullets and bombs. This was surgical. This was personal.

I was so lost in thought that I almost walked past her.

She was standing on the corner of Hill and Third, near the entrance to my office building. Dark hair caught in the wind, a coat that looked too expensive for this neighborhood, face turned slightly away from me. But there was something about the line of her profile—the sharp widow's peak, the single darker strand falling across her forehead—that made me stop.

The woman from the bar. The one who'd disappeared without leaving.

For a moment, our eyes almost met. I saw her face in profile, and something in my chest lurched—not recognition exactly, but the ghost of recognition, the sense that I knew her from somewhere I couldn't name. Her left eye caught the gray light, and I could have sworn I saw something strange in it, a flicker of color that didn't belong.

Then she turned and walked away, her heels clicking on the wet pavement, her figure receding into the midday crowd. I watched her go, rooted to the spot, unable to shake the feeling that she'd been waiting for me. That she'd wanted me to see her.

By the time I thought to follow, she was gone. Swallowed by the city, as if she'd never been there at all.

I stood on the corner for a long moment, rain beginning to fall again, trying to make sense of what I'd seen. A beautiful woman. A strange face. The feeling of being watched by eyes that knew more than they should.

It didn't fit anywhere. It was a loose thread in a case that was already unraveling.

I filed it away with all the other things I couldn't explain and went back to work.

---

The rebuilding started that afternoon.

I called the witnesses who hadn't recanted—the three who were still willing to talk. Two of them agreed to give me new statements, though their voices were tight with fear, and both of them made me promise I wouldn't write down their names this time. The third, a junior accountant at City Hall, listened to my request and then hung up without a word.

I went back to the courthouse and found the documents I'd photographed, but the originals had been pulled from the files. "Misfiled," the clerk said, not meeting my eyes. "Sometimes things get lost."

I visited the newspaper morgue and requested the back issues I'd used, but half of them had been removed for "repair." The librarian couldn't tell me when they'd be back.

By evening, I had maybe a quarter of what I'd started with. Not enough to make the recall case. Not enough to bring down Shaw. But maybe enough to prove that something was rotten, that the corruption was real, that someone should investigate even if that someone couldn't be me.

I drove back to Bunker Hill as the sun set behind the downtown towers, painting the clouds orange and red. The Buick's engine coughed twice on the hill—needed a tune-up I couldn't afford—but it got me home. I parked in the alley and climbed the stairs to my room, every step feeling heavier than the last.

The door was unlocked again.

I drew my gun, pushed it open with my foot.

Empty. Nothing disturbed. But on my pillow, folded neatly, was a single sheet of paper.

I picked it up with hands that weren't quite steady.

Three words, typed on a machine that left no identifying marks:

STOP OR DIE

I crumpled the paper and threw it in the corner.

Then I poured myself a drink, sat on the edge of my bed, and started writing down everything I could remember. Every witness, every document, every connection I'd made. If they were going to kill me, I was going to make sure the case survived. I was going to put it all in a letter, seal it in an envelope, and leave it with someone I trusted—if I could find anyone in this city I still trusted.

Someone had to give a damn.

Even if it meant dying for nothing.

# Scene 6: Blackmail and Betrayal

The blackmail case found me three days after the warning note.

I was sitting in my office, trying to reconstruct the corruption file from memory, when the door opened and a man walked in who reeked of money and desperation in equal measure. His suit was silk, his shoes were Italian leather, and his hands were shaking so badly he had to clamp them together to keep me from seeing.

"I need your help." He sat without being invited, his bulk settling into the client chair like a load of wet sand. "Someone is threatening to ruin me."

His name was Howard Brennan. Real estate developer, country club member, the kind of man who usually wouldn't set foot in a Bunker Hill walkup unless he was slumming or in trouble. He was clearly in trouble.

"What kind of ruin?" I asked.

"There's a woman." He said it like a confession, which I suppose it was. "I've been seeing her for... for some time. My wife doesn't know. Can't know. And now someone has photographs. They're demanding ten thousand dollars, or they send copies to my wife, my business partners, the newspapers."

Ten thousand dollars. More money than I'd seen in my life. More money than most people in this city would earn in a decade.

"When's the deadline?"

"Three days. They gave me a week, and I've spent four of it trying to figure out what to do." His eyes were red-rimmed, bloodshot. The eyes of a man who hadn't slept since this started. "I could pay it—I have the money—but they'll just come back for more. They always do. I need someone to find out who's behind this. Someone to make it stop."

I should have refused. The corruption case was crumbling around me, and taking on another job would spread me too thin. But Howard Brennan was sitting in my office with money in his pocket, and my rent was due, and the cynical part of me whispered that an ordinary blackmail case might go right in a way the corruption case couldn't.

"Five hundred dollars," I said. "Retainer against expenses. And I'll need everything you have—the photographs, the demand letter, any contact you've had with the blackmailer."

He paid in cash, counting out fifty-dollar bills with fingers that still trembled. The photographs were in an envelope inside his coat—three of them, grainy but clear enough, showing Brennan and a dark-haired woman in what was unmistakably a hotel room. The demand letter was typed, no signature, postmarked from downtown Los Angeles.

I studied the photographs while Brennan watched, his face cycling through shades of shame and fear.

"The woman," I said. "Who is she?"

"Her name is Gloria. Gloria Dane. She's... she works at a club downtown. I've been seeing her for about six months."

"Does she know about the blackmail?"

"I don't know. I haven't talked to her since the letter came. I've been too scared to..." He trailed off, unable to finish the sentence.

I put the photographs back in the envelope. "I'll look into it. Don't contact Gloria, don't try to investigate on your own, and for God's sake don't pay the blackmailer. If they think you'll pay once, they'll never stop."

Brennan nodded, the motion jerky, automatic. He stood, adjusted his silk tie with unsteady hands, and walked to the door.

"Mr. Malone." He turned back, his face a study in barely controlled panic. "If you can't stop this... if they release those photographs..."

"I understand."

He left. I sat at my desk and looked at the envelope full of photographs and thought about how many ways this could go wrong.

---

Gloria Dane worked at a place called The Velvet Room, a nightclub on South Main that catered to businessmen who wanted discretion with their drinks. I went there that night, paid the cover charge, and found a table near the stage where a four-piece band was playing something slow and smoky.

She was easy to spot. Brennan had described her, and besides, she was the kind of woman who drew attention without trying—dark hair, full lips, a figure that the sequined dress she wore did nothing to hide. She moved between tables, smiling at customers, accepting drinks, playing the game that women in her position had to play to survive.

I watched her for an hour before approaching. Watched the men she talked to, the way she touched their arms and laughed at their jokes, the subtle transactions of attention and money that passed between them. She was good at her job. Professional in a way that suggested she'd been doing this long enough to know all the moves.

When she finally came to my table, her smile was automatic, part of the uniform.

"Buy a girl a drink?"

"I'll buy you information," I said. "If you have it."

The smile faltered. She looked at me more closely, and I saw something shift behind her eyes—calculation, wariness, the quick assessment of a woman who'd learned to size up danger.

"I'm not that kind of girl."

"I know exactly what kind of girl you are, Miss Dane." I kept my voice low, neutral. "I know about Howard Brennan. I know about the photographs. What I want to know is whether you're in on the blackmail or just caught in it."

The color drained from her face. She sat down without being invited, her composure cracking.

"How did you—"

"Brennan hired me to find the blackmailer. I'm not interested in ruining your life, Miss Dane. I just need to know who's behind this."

She looked around the club, checking for watchers. Her hands, I noticed, were clenched in her lap.

"I don't know who's doing it," she said finally. "I swear to God, I don't know. The photographs—I didn't even know they existed until someone sent me copies. They told me if I warned Brennan, they'd kill me. If I went to the police, they'd kill me. All I could do was sit here and wait and hope it would be over soon."

I believed her. The fear in her voice was too raw, too immediate to be faked.

"Do you have any enemies? Anyone who knew about you and Brennan, who might want to hurt one or both of you?"

She shook her head. "I was careful. I'm always careful. This shouldn't have happened."

"But it did." I took out my notebook, wrote down my office address and phone number, tore out the page. "If you think of anything—anyone who might have been watching you, any strange contacts, anything at all—call me. Day or night."

She took the paper with trembling fingers. "Are you going to find who did this?"

"I'm going to try."

"And if you don't?"

I didn't have an answer for that. Neither did she.

---

I spent the next two days tracking the blackmailer.

The demand letter led nowhere—generic typewriter, standard paper, postmarked from a mailbox outside the main post office. The photographs were harder. I found a darkroom tech who owed me a favor, and he examined the prints, looking for any identifying marks.

"Professional work," he said, holding the images up to the light. "Good paper, clean development. Whoever took these knew what they were doing. And see here?" He pointed to the edge of one photograph. "That's a Leica lens signature. High-end camera, not the kind you buy at a drugstore."

High-end equipment meant a professional photographer. Someone who'd been hired specifically to take these shots. I started working the list of professionals in the city, showing the photographs to anyone who might recognize the style.

On the second day, I found him.

His name was Jerry Novak, and he worked out of a studio on Sixth Street, taking publicity shots for actors and models who couldn't afford the big names. He was a small man, his fingers never still, with the pale skin of someone who spent too much time in darkrooms.

When I showed him the photographs, his face went white.

"Where did you get these?"

"Doesn't matter. What matters is that you took them."

He tried to lie, but he was bad at it. Within five minutes, I had the whole story. He'd been hired by a man he didn't know—"tall, dark hair, expensive suit, paid cash"—to set up surveillance in a specific hotel room and photograph anyone who came through. He'd delivered the negatives a week ago, collected his fee, and tried to forget the whole thing.

"The man who hired you," I said. "Would you recognize him if you saw him again?"

Novak shook his head. "He wore a hat, kept his face in shadow. I never got a good look. Just the voice—low, flat, no accent. Like he was trying not to have one."

"And the hotel room? Whose name was it under?"

Novak's eyes darted away. "I don't know. I just got the room number and the key. Didn't ask questions."

I left him with a warning not to leave town and a certainty that I was missing something. The man who'd hired Novak wasn't the blackmailer—he was too careful, too professional. He was a cutout, a layer of insulation between the real operator and the dirty work.

But why go to so much trouble to blackmail Howard Brennan? Ten thousand dollars was a lot of money, but not enough to justify this level of planning. There had to be something else. Something I wasn't seeing.

---

I found it the next morning.

I was in the Hall of Records, checking property transfers—still trying to rebuild the corruption case—when I came across Howard Brennan's name. He'd been buying land in the Valley, dozens of parcels over the past year, through a series of shell companies that all traced back to his development firm.

Land that, according to the surveys, was practically worthless. Flood plain, unstable soil, too far from the city to be commercially viable.

Unless you knew something the surveys didn't.

I dug deeper. Found a proposal buried in the city planning archives—a flood control project that would rechannelize the Los Angeles River, making the Valley land valuable. A project that had been quietly approved by the city council three months ago, that hadn't been announced to the public yet, that would make anyone who owned the right parcels very, very rich.

Howard Brennan had insider information. He was buying up land before the flood control announcement, planning to make a fortune on what was essentially legal corruption.

And someone was blackmailing him. Not for the affair—the affair was just leverage. They wanted something else.

I called Brennan's office. His secretary said he was in meetings all day. I called his home. His wife said he'd left early that morning and she didn't know where he was.

I called Gloria Dane at The Velvet Room. No answer.

By noon, I knew something was wrong. By two o'clock, I was certain.

By three, the police were at my door.

---

They found Jerry Novak dead in his studio. Shot twice, close range, with a .38-caliber revolver. The same caliber as the Colt Detective Special I carried in my shoulder holster.

The same Colt that had been taken from my safe when they ransacked my office. The same Colt that had been logged as missing in my report to the insurance company.

I sat in the interrogation room at Central Division, facing Detective Burke and his partner, and watched my life fall apart.

"Let me get this straight," Burke said, a smile spreading across his florid face. "You were investigating a blackmail case. The photographer who took the blackmail photos turns up dead, killed with your gun. And you expect us to believe you had nothing to do with it?"

"Someone stole my gun. You know that. I filed a report."

"A convenient report." Burke leaned forward. "Here's what I think happened, Malone. You found the photographer, you squeezed him for information, and when he couldn't give you what you wanted, you killed him. Or maybe you killed him because he knew too much. Either way, you're looking at a murder charge."

"I didn't kill anyone."

"Then who did?"

I didn't have an answer. The frame was too neat, too perfect. Someone had used my gun to kill Novak, knowing I would be connected to the case, knowing the police would come for me. The same someone who'd been sabotaging the corruption case. The same someone who seemed to know my every move before I made it.

They held me overnight. In the morning, a lawyer I'd never seen before showed up and got me released on my own recognizance—Vernon Shaw's doing, I assumed, though the lawyer wouldn't confirm it. The evidence was circumstantial; I had no motive for killing Novak; and Burke, for all his bluster, knew he didn't have enough for a conviction.

But the damage was done. My name was in the papers now, connected to a murder. The witnesses I'd been trying to re-interview would never talk to me again. The corruption case was effectively dead.

I walked out of the police station into gray February light and tried to think of what came next.

Howard Brennan had disappeared. Gloria Dane had disappeared. Jerry Novak was dead. And I was walking around with a murder charge hanging over my head like a sword on a fraying thread.

Someone was playing a game I didn't understand. Someone who had more power than the Combination, more reach than the police, more patience than any enemy I'd ever faced.

I walked home through streets that felt suddenly foreign, past faces that might have been watching me, under a sky that promised more rain. The pieces of the case lay scattered around me like fragments of a shattered mirror, each one reflecting a different angle of the same truth:

I was losing.

But I wasn't going to stop.

Someone had to give a damn. Even when giving a damn got people killed.

# Scene 7: The Flood

The rain started on February 27th, and it didn't stop.

I woke to the sound of water—not the gentle drip of a leak or the steady patter of a normal storm, but a roar. A wall of sound that pressed against the windows of my boarding room like something alive and hungry. I pulled back the curtain and looked out at a city dissolving.

The streets had become rivers. Bunker Hill's Victorian mansions seemed to sag under the weight of water pouring from their gutters, streaming down their walls, pooling around their foundations. Angels Flight had shut down—I could see the cables hanging slack, the orange cars frozen on their tracks. Below, where downtown should have been visible, there was only gray. Gray sky, gray rain, gray water rushing through streets that had never been designed to handle this much.

I dressed and went downstairs. The landlady, Mrs. Patterson, was standing in the lobby with a bucket in each hand, trying to catch the water coming through a hole in the ceiling.

"It's the end times," she said without looking at me. "The Lord is washing this city clean."

I didn't argue. Looking at the water streaming past the windows, it was hard to say she was wrong.

---

The flood lasted five days.

By the end of the first day, the LA River had jumped its banks. The concrete channels that were supposed to contain it proved useless against the volume of water pouring down from the mountains. Whole neighborhoods were underwater. Bridges collapsed—I heard the news on the radio, station after station reporting the same disasters: Lankershim Bridge, gone. Owensmouth, gone. Half a dozen rail lines washed out, telegraph poles down, roads impassable.

I couldn't get to my office. The lower floors of my building were flooded, and even if I could have reached the door, there was nothing there worth saving. Whatever the water hadn't destroyed, the looters would. That's how it worked in this city—disaster wasn't tragedy, just opportunity in a different costume.

I spent the first two days in my room, listening to the radio and drinking what was left of my whiskey. The news was all flood, all the time. Hundred confirmed dead and rising. Thousands homeless. The movie studios had shut down; Hollywood was an island cut off from the rest of the city. Downtown was being evacuated. The National Guard had been called in.

And somewhere beneath all the noise, buried under the catastrophe, the Combination kept operating. I knew it without having to see it. The corrupt machinery of Los Angeles didn't stop for floods. It just adapted.

On the third day, the rain let up enough for me to venture out.

---

The city was unrecognizable.

I walked down Bunker Hill through streets covered in mud and debris. Trees had been uprooted, cars had been overturned, walls of sandbags had failed and been swept away. The air smelled of sewage and rotting vegetation and something else, something sweet and wrong that I didn't want to identify.

I made it to my office building by afternoon. The ground floor was a ruin—mud and water and wreckage piled against the walls, the elevator shaft flooded, the stairs treacherous with slime. But the second floor, where my office was, had been just above the waterline.

What I found there was worse than flooding.

Everything was gone.

Not destroyed—gone. The filing cabinets stood open and empty. The desk drawers had been pulled out and dumped. My safe, the one they'd already cracked once, had been hauled away entirely, leaving only scrape marks on the floor where it had stood.

I stood in the empty room and felt something shift inside me.

Not anger. Not despair. Something deeper. A kind of clarity that came from having lost everything there was to lose.

They had taken it all. The evidence I'd rebuilt, the notes I'd hidden, even the letter I'd written documenting the case—everything. The flood had given them perfect cover. While the city was drowning, they'd come for the last scraps of what I'd built, and they'd erased me as thoroughly as if I'd never existed.

I sat down in my chair—the one piece of furniture they'd left, maybe as a joke—and pulled out my notebook. The one I'd kept in my coat pocket, the one that was still damp from the rain but readable.

It contained maybe a fifth of what I'd known. Names, dates, fragments. Not enough to make a case. Not enough to bring down anyone.

But it was something.

I started writing.

---

The reformers called two days later, when the rain had finally stopped and the city was beginning to assess the damage.

Vernon Shaw's voice was different on the phone—older, more tired. "I heard about your office, Malone. I'm sorry."

"Don't be sorry. Be helpful. Are you still pushing the recall?"

A long pause. "The petition is due in two weeks. We have the signatures. But without the evidence you were gathering..."

"Without the evidence, you've got nothing but accusations." I looked at the notebook in my hand. "I can give you what I remember. It won't be enough for a prosecution, but it might be enough to make noise. Get some newspaper coverage. Put pressure on."

"Is that safe for you? After everything that's happened?"

I thought about the murder charge still hanging over my head. About the death threats, the ransacked office, the pattern of destruction that had followed me for months. About the certainty, growing stronger every day, that I was not going to survive to see the recall election.

"Safe doesn't matter anymore," I said. "What matters is getting the information out there before they silence everyone who knows it."

Another pause. "All right. Can you come to my home tomorrow? We'll put together what we have and figure out how to use it."

I agreed. We set a time. I hung up the phone and sat in my empty office as the sun set over a city still dripping with flood water, and I wrote down everything I could remember.

---

That night, I went to a bar.

Not The Blue Parrot, not any of the places connected to the case. Just a dive on Alameda Street, the kind of place where nobody asked questions and nobody remembered faces. I sat at the bar and drank whiskey and tried to think about what came next.

The corruption case was dead. The blackmail case was dead. Everyone I'd tried to help was dead or disappeared or pretending I didn't exist. I was a murder suspect, a marked man, a detective with no cases and no prospects and no reason to believe tomorrow would be any better than today.

And yet.

I kept coming back to the same thought, the same phrase that seemed to arise from somewhere deeper than my own mind:

Someone has to give a damn.

Not because it would change anything. The Combination would survive the recall, no matter what evidence came to light. Mayor Shaw might go down, but someone else would take his place. The corruption was too deep, too entrenched, too much a part of what Los Angeles was. You couldn't cut it out any more than you could cut the rot out of a corpse.

But you could try. You could keep trying. You could stand in front of the machine and say, This is wrong, even if saying it got you killed. You could bear witness. You could refuse to look away.

That was worth something. Maybe it was worth everything.

I didn't know where the certainty came from. It felt older than me, older than this life, like an echo from somewhere I'd never been. But it was there, solid as bone, immovable as stone.

I finished my drink, paid my tab, and walked out into a night that smelled of rain and mud and new beginnings.

---

The next morning, I met with Vernon Shaw.

His home was in Hancock Park, a sprawling Spanish Revival that had survived the flood better than most. He looked ten years older than when I'd first met him—the country club tan faded, the confident manner replaced by something grimmer.

We sat in his study and I told him everything I remembered. The payoff structures. The witness statements. The connections between City Hall and the police and the gambling ships. He wrote it down in careful longhand, asking questions when my memory faltered, filling in gaps from his own knowledge.

By the end, we had maybe twenty pages. Not a case. Not proof. But a map of the corruption, detailed enough that anyone who wanted to follow it could.

"What will you do with it?" I asked.

"There's a reporter at the Herald-Express. Young, ambitious, willing to take on Shaw. I'll give it to him. Let him decide if it's worth the risk."

"And if he publishes?"

Vernon Shaw looked at me with eyes that had seen too much. "Then at least it's out there. At least someone knows. Even if nothing changes, at least the truth is on the record."

I nodded. That was all any of us could hope for. The truth on the record. A marker in the sand, even as the tide came in to wash it away.

"You should leave the city, Malone." Vernon's voice was gentle. "You've done what you can. More than anyone could expect. There's no shame in walking away now."

I thought about it. Thought about getting on a train, heading east or north or anywhere that wasn't Los Angeles. Starting over in a city that didn't know my name or my failures.

"I'm not finished," I said.

"The case is finished. What's left?"

I didn't have an answer. Not one I could put into words. But the thought was still there, that strange certainty that had been growing since the flood:

Someone has to give a damn. Even if it doesn't change anything. Even if it's pointless.

Especially if it's pointless.

"I'll stay," I said. "A little while longer."

Vernon Shaw didn't argue. Maybe he understood. Or maybe he just knew there was no point trying to save a man who didn't want to be saved.

I drove back to Bunker Hill as the sun climbed toward noon. The streets were drying out, the mud hardening into ruts and ridges. The city was already forgetting the flood, already moving on to the next disaster, the next scandal, the next beautiful nightmare.

I parked my Buick in the alley behind my boarding house and climbed the stairs to my room. The door was locked, unchanged. No threatening notes, no evidence of intrusion.

But I knew they were watching. I knew they were waiting.

And I knew, with a certainty that went beyond logic or self-preservation, that I wasn't going to stop.

Not because I thought I could win. Not because I believed in justice or redemption or any of the noble abstractions that men used to justify dying.

Just because someone had to try.

Just because the trying was not nothing.

# Scene 8: The Car

March came in cold.

The flood had passed, but the rain hadn't stopped entirely—just settled into a steady drizzle that made everything feel gray and exhausted. The city was cleaning up, hauling away debris, rebuilding bridges, pretending that everything was going to be fine. The newspapers were full of stories about resilience and recovery. The Combination was back to business as usual.

And I was running out of time.

The murder charge hadn't gone away. Burke kept calling me in for "follow-up questions," each session a little more aggressive than the last. The circumstantial evidence was piling up, not because I was guilty, but because someone was making sure the pile grew. Witnesses I'd never met were coming forward to place me near Novak's studio. A gun dealer claimed I'd bought a replacement .38 two days before the killing. Lies, all of it, but the kind of lies that could put a man in San Quentin.

I kept working anyway.

Vernon Shaw's reporter had started sniffing around the corruption story. Nothing published yet, but noise was being made. Phone calls to city officials. Requests for records. The kind of activity that made powerful people sweat.

And the Combination was sweating. I could feel it in the way Burke looked at me, in the silence that fell when I walked into certain bars, in the way my neighbors at the boarding house had started avoiding eye contact. Something was coming. Something bigger than a murder charge.

I knew what it was. Had known since Raymond's car exploded in January. When you got too close to the Combination, when you became too much of a threat, they didn't bother with courts and charges. They went straight to the simplest solution.

A bomb. A bullet. A body in an alley, written off as robbery or accident or one more casualty of a violent city.

I was going to die. Probably soon. Probably before the recall election could change anything.

But I wasn't going to quit.

---

The last two weeks of my life were strangely peaceful.

Not calm, exactly—there was still work to do, still witnesses to track down, still pages of notes to transcribe and pass along to Shaw's network. But beneath the activity, beneath the fear and the exhaustion, there was something else. A kind of settled certainty that I couldn't quite name.

I woke each morning knowing that it might be my last, and somehow that made each morning clearer. The coffee tasted sharper. The rain on the windows looked more beautiful. The small kindnesses of strangers—a smile from the woman who sold newspapers on the corner, a nod from a fellow rider on Angels Flight—seemed precious in a way they never had before.

I kept a letter in my pocket, updated every few days. Not a confession or a farewell, just an accounting: what I knew, who I'd talked to, what I'd learned. If they found my body, I wanted someone to find the letter too. Wanted the truth to survive even if I didn't.

Someone has to give a damn.

The phrase ran through my head like a mantra now. I didn't know where it came from—didn't remember ever deciding to believe it—but it was there, constant and sure. Not just about the corruption case, not just about Los Angeles. About everything. About the way a man should live, whether he had fifty years left or five days.

You couldn't fix the world. You couldn't save everyone. You couldn't even save yourself.

But you could try. You could keep trying, even when trying was pointless. You could refuse to stop caring, even when caring cost you everything.

That was worth something. Maybe it was worth everything.

---

The morning it happened, I knew.

Not how or when—just that this was the day. I felt it the way you feel a storm coming, a pressure change in the air, a weight against your skin that hasn't quite become rain.

I dressed carefully. Clean shirt, pressed suit, the gray fedora that had seen me through two years of private work and sixteen years on the force before that. I checked my gun—not the Colt, which they'd taken, but a backup piece I'd picked up at a pawnshop, a cheap .32 that would do in a pinch.

Then I sat at my desk and wrote one more letter.

Not to Vernon Shaw. Not to the reporter or the police or anyone who could do anything with the information.

To no one. To whoever might find it. To the universe, maybe, if the universe was listening.

*I don't know who will read this, or if anyone will. But I want to say something before I go.*

*I've been a cop and a soldier and a private detective. I've seen people at their worst and, occasionally, at their best. I've failed more cases than I've solved, lost more fights than I've won. I'm going to die today, probably, and when I do, the corruption I've been fighting will still be standing. Nothing I've done will change that.*

*But here's what I've learned, in these last few weeks, as everything fell apart:*

*The trying matters. Not because it succeeds. Not because it changes anything. Just because someone has to try. Someone has to look at what's wrong and say it's wrong, even if saying it gets you killed. Someone has to give a damn, even when giving a damn is pointless.*

*I didn't save anyone. Every case I worked this year went south. Every witness I tried to protect ended up dead or running. I'm going to die with nothing to show for any of it.*

*But the trying was not nothing.*

*I don't know why that feels true. It feels older than me, deeper than anything I could have figured out on my own. Like an echo from somewhere I've never been. Like a promise I made a long time ago and don't remember making.*

*Whoever you are, wherever you are: keep trying. Even when it's pointless. Especially when it's pointless.*

*Someone has to give a damn.*

*Someone will.*

I folded the letter and put it in my inside coat pocket, next to my heart.

Then I went downstairs to get my car.

---

The Buick Roadmaster was parked in the alley behind the boarding house, where it had been for three days. I hadn't driven it since the flood—hadn't needed to, hadn't wanted to. But today I was going to meet Vernon Shaw one last time, to hand over the final batch of notes, and the streetcar wouldn't get me there fast enough.

The rain had started again. Not hard, just a steady drizzle that made the world look like it was crying. I pulled my hat down and my collar up and walked through the mud to where the Buick sat waiting.

It was a beautiful car, even now. Three years old, but I'd kept it polished, kept the chrome shining. The rain beaded on the black hood like tears on a mourner's cheek. I'd bought it from a widow on Hope Street, a woman whose husband had died and left her nothing but debts and this one extravagance. She'd needed the money. I'd needed the car. Los Angeles, making trades.

I unlocked the door and slid behind the wheel.

The interior smelled of old leather and cigarettes and the faint mustiness of a car that had been sitting too long. The seat creaked as I settled into it. The steering wheel was cold under my hands.

I looked out the windshield at the rain falling on the alley, at the back of the boarding house, at the gray morning light that seemed to promise nothing good.

And then I saw her.

She was standing on the sidewalk at the end of the alley, near where it opened onto Hill Street. A woman in a dark coat, dark hair visible under the brim of a fashionable hat. She was looking at me.

The same woman. The one from the bar, from the street corner. The one who kept appearing and disappearing like a ghost.

This time, I could see her face clearly. The sharp widow's peak. The single darker strand that fell across her forehead despite the rain. Her eyes, fixed on mine across fifty feet of wet pavement—and in one of them, the left one, something strange. A flicker of color that didn't belong. Green, maybe, a pale crescent of green in an iris that should have been brown.

She knew.

I don't know how I knew she knew, but I did. She was waiting for something. Watching for something. And whatever it was, it was about to happen.

Our eyes held for one long moment. Then she started to move—not toward me, but away, turning, beginning to walk quickly down the sidewalk, as if she could see what was coming and wanted to be gone before it arrived.

A passerby, rushing to avoid.

I turned the key.

---

The world became light.

I don't remember the sound—the detonation was too close, too sudden, for my ears to process as noise. Just brightness, overwhelming, filling my vision like a second sun had been born beneath the hood of my car. Then pressure, a wave of force that picked me up and threw me somewhere I couldn't track.

Then pain.

I was lying on the pavement. I knew that without opening my eyes. Wet and cold and hard beneath my back, rain falling on my face. The Buick was burning—I could hear it now, a crackling roar, could smell the gasoline and rubber and metal turning to smoke.

I tried to move. My body responded wrong, signals scrambling, limbs not finding their proper places. Something was broken in my chest. Something was bleeding, a lot, warm and wet mixing with the rain.

I opened my eyes.

The sky was gray. The rain fell straight down, each drop hitting my face like a tiny cold finger. I could see the flames from the car, orange and yellow against the gray, throwing shadows that danced on the walls of the alley.

Footsteps. Someone running toward me, then stopping. A face above me—not the woman, someone else, a stranger, eyes wide with shock.

"Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. Someone call an ambulance!"

The face disappeared. More footsteps, more voices. The sounds of a city reacting to violence, the same sounds I'd heard a hundred times as a cop. Sirens in the distance, getting closer or maybe just imagined.

I lay on the pavement and looked at the sky and felt my life leaving me.

---

The pain was fading.

That was the first sign, the one I recognized from the war—the way bad wounds stop hurting when there's not enough blood left to carry the signals. My body was shutting down, system by system, conserving what little it had for the parts that still needed to work.

My eyes still worked. I could see the rain. Could see the flames dying as someone threw a blanket over the burning car. Could see shapes moving at the edge of my vision, people gathering, the audience that always appears when someone dies in public.

And at the edge of the crowd, standing apart, the woman.

She hadn't left. She was watching me from the sidewalk, her face unreadable, her strange eyes fixed on mine. There was something in her expression—not satisfaction, not grief, something else. Recognition, maybe. Or understanding.

She knew who I was. Not just Jack Malone, private detective. Something else. Something older.

The thought should have frightened me, but I was beyond fear now. Beyond everything except this moment, this rain, this slow departure.

I closed my eyes.

---

In the darkness behind my eyelids, something shifted.

Not memory, exactly. Deeper than memory. A sense of vastness, of connection, of threads running backward through time to places I couldn't name but somehow knew.

Other lives. Other deaths. Other hands reaching out in the final moments, grasping for something they couldn't find.

I saw a temple floor, stone cold beneath a dying man's back. I saw a battlefield, mud and blood and the screams of the wounded. I saw a plague city, a desert cave, a philosopher's cell, a palace chamber, a ship in a storm. I saw lives stacked upon lives, deaths upon deaths, the same soul learning the same lessons in a thousand different bodies.

And I understood.

Not the details—those were beyond me, fading even as they appeared. But the shape of it. The pattern.

I'd been trying for a long time. Longer than this life, longer than I could imagine. Trying to help, trying to fix, trying to make things right in worlds that resisted being fixed. And failing. Always failing. Every life, every effort, ending in death and defeat and the certainty that nothing had changed.

But the trying mattered.

That was the lesson. The one I'd been learning since before I could remember. Not that you could succeed—success was an illusion, a horizon that receded as you approached. But that the effort itself had weight. Had meaning. Had value beyond any outcome it might achieve.

The trying was not nothing.

I felt something loosen in my chest. Not the broken ribs, not the collapsing lungs. Something else. A chain I'd been carrying so long I'd forgotten it was there. The need to be the one who fixed things, saved things, made the difference—a grip I'd held so tight my fingers had gone numb.

The fetter of identity. The belief that there was a "me" separate from the trying, a self that needed to be preserved and protected and proven right.

It was loosening. Almost breaking. One more push, one more life, and it would snap.

And then—

What? I didn't know. Couldn't know. But I could feel it waiting, just beyond the edge of this life, a door that had been locked for ages and was finally coming open.

I will try again.

The thought arose without effort, without decision. A promise to something I couldn't name. A commitment that went beyond this body, this life, this death.

I will try again. I will keep trying. And someday—soon—the trying will finally be enough.

---

The rain fell on my face like baptism.

My blood was spreading on the pavement, mixing with the water, washing away. I could feel myself getting lighter, the weight of the body becoming irrelevant, the pain fading into a kind of distant music.

Voices above me, urgent, meaningless. Sirens getting closer. Someone was pressing something against my chest, trying to stop the bleeding, but it was too late for that. I'd been a cop long enough to know a fatal wound when I felt one.

I opened my eyes one last time.

The woman was still there. Still watching. But she was further away now, or maybe I was further away. She was receding into the rain, into the gray, her face becoming less distinct, her eyes fading from strange to ordinary to invisible.

A passerby. A witness. Nothing more.

But she knew. And I knew. And in that knowing was something that mattered more than all the evidence I'd gathered, all the cases I'd failed, all the people I hadn't managed to save.

The trying was not nothing.

I didn't save anyone. The Combination would survive. The corruption would continue. Nothing I did made any difference at all.

But the trying was not nothing.

I closed my eyes.

The rain kept falling. The sirens arrived. The crowd pressed closer, and somewhere in the noise and chaos, Jack Malone, age thirty-eight, private detective, stopped breathing.

---

The body lay on the wet pavement for a long time after that.

The ambulance came and went—there was nothing to be done, the medics said, he was gone before they arrived. The police came too, taking photographs, making notes, treating it as what it obviously was: another car bombing in a city that had seen too many. The reporter from the Herald-Express showed up, asked a few questions, wrote a story that would run on page eight the next morning.

The rain kept falling.

And somewhere else—somewhere that had no name, no location, no existence in any geography the living could map—something stirred.

A momentum that had been building for millennia. A pattern that had been waiting for completion. Ten lessons, learned through ten lifetimes of failure. Ten perfections, purified by ten kinds of fire.

And now, finally: the urge that would carry forward into the next life. The certainty that the trying mattered. The readiness to break the chains that remained.

Someone has to give a damn.

I will try again.

The rain fell on the empty body. The city went on with its business. The corruption continued and the corrupt prospered and nothing changed.

But somewhere, in a way that no one in Los Angeles would ever understand, everything had changed.

The wheel turned.

A new life began.
