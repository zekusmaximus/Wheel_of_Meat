The flood lasted five days.

By the end of the first day, the LA River had jumped its banks. The concrete channels that were supposed to contain it proved useless against the volume of water pouring down from the mountains. Whole neighborhoods were underwater. Bridges collapsed—I heard the news on the radio, station after station reporting the same disasters: Lankershim Bridge, gone. Owensmouth, gone. Half a dozen rail lines washed out, telegraph poles down, roads impassable.

I couldn't get to my office. The lower floors of my building were flooded, and even if I could have reached the door, there was nothing there worth saving. Whatever the water hadn't destroyed, the looters would. That's how it worked in this city—disaster wasn't tragedy, just opportunity in a different costume.

I spent the first two days in my room, listening to the radio and drinking what was left of my whiskey. The news was all flood, all the time. Hundred confirmed dead and rising. Thousands homeless. The movie studios had shut down; Hollywood was an island cut off from the rest of the city. Downtown was being evacuated. The National Guard had been called in.

And somewhere beneath all the noise, buried under the catastrophe, the Combination kept operating. I knew it without having to see it. The corrupt machinery of Los Angeles didn't stop for floods. It just adapted.

On the third day, the rain let up enough for me to venture out.

The city was unrecognizable.

I walked down Bunker Hill through streets covered in mud and debris. Trees had been uprooted, cars had been overturned, walls of sandbags had failed and been swept away. The air smelled of sewage and rotting vegetation and something else, something sweet and wrong that I didn't want to identify.

I made it to my office building by afternoon. The ground floor was a ruin—mud and water and wreckage piled against the walls, the elevator shaft flooded, the stairs treacherous with slime. But the second floor, where my office was, had been just above the waterline.

What I found there was worse than flooding.

Everything was gone.

Gone rather than destroyed. The filing cabinets stood open and empty. The desk drawers had been pulled out and dumped. My safe, the one they'd already cracked once, had been hauled away entirely, leaving only scrape marks on the floor where it had stood.

I stood in the empty room and felt something shift inside me.

Something deeper than anger or despair. A kind of clarity that came from having lost everything there was to lose.

They had taken it all. The evidence I'd rebuilt, the notes I'd hidden, even the letter I'd written documenting the case—everything. The flood had given them perfect cover. While the city was drowning, they'd come for the last scraps of what I'd built, and they'd erased me as thoroughly as if I'd never existed.

I sat down in my chair—the one piece of furniture they'd left, maybe as a joke—and pulled out my notebook. The one I'd kept in my coat pocket, the one that was still damp from the rain but readable.

It contained maybe a fifth of what I'd known. Names, dates, fragments. Insufficient to make a case or bring down anyone.

But it was something.

I started writing.

The reformers called two days later, when the rain had finally stopped and the city was beginning to assess the damage.

Vernon Shaw's voice was different on the phone—older, more tired. "I heard about your office, Malone. I'm sorry."

"Don't be sorry. Be helpful. Are you still pushing the recall?"

A long pause. "The petition is due in two weeks. We have the signatures. But without the evidence you were gathering..."

"Without the evidence, you've got nothing but accusations." I looked at the notebook in my hand. "I can give you what I remember. It won't be enough for a prosecution, but it might be enough to make noise. Get some newspaper coverage. Put pressure on."

"Is that safe for you? After everything that's happened?"

I thought about the murder charge still hanging over my head. About the death threats, the ransacked office, the pattern of destruction that had followed me for months. About my growing certainty that I was not going to survive to see the recall election.

"Safe doesn't matter anymore," I said. "What matters is getting the information out there before they silence everyone who knows it."

Another pause. "All right. Can you come to my home tomorrow? We'll put together what we have and figure out how to use it."

I agreed. We set a time. I hung up the phone and sat in my empty office as the sun set over a city still dripping with flood water, and I wrote down everything I could remember.

That night, I went to a bar.

Not The Blue Parrot, not any of the places connected to the case. Just a dive on Alameda Street, the kind of place where nobody asked questions and nobody remembered faces. I sat at the bar and drank whiskey and tried to think about what came next.

The corruption case was dead. The blackmail case was dead. Everyone I'd tried to help was dead or disappeared or pretending I didn't exist. I was a murder suspect, a marked man, a detective with no cases and no prospects and no reason to believe tomorrow would be any better than today.

And yet.

I kept coming back to the same thought, the same phrase that seemed to arise from somewhere deeper than my own mind:

Someone has to give a damn.

Not because it would change anything. The Combination would survive the recall, no matter what evidence came to light. Mayor Shaw might go down, but someone else would take his place. The corruption was too deep, too entrenched, too much a part of what Los Angeles was. You couldn't cut it out any more than you could cut the rot out of a corpse.

But you could try. You could keep trying. You could stand in front of the machine and say, This is wrong, even if saying it got you killed. You could bear witness. You could refuse to look away.

That was worth something. Maybe it was worth everything.

I didn't know where the certainty came from. It felt older than me, older than this life, like an echo from somewhere I'd never been. But it was there, solid as bone, immovable as stone.

I finished my drink, paid my tab, and walked out into a night that smelled of rain and mud and new beginnings.

---

The next morning, I met with Vernon Shaw.

His home was in Hancock Park, a sprawling Spanish Revival that had survived the flood better than most. He looked ten years older than when I'd first met him—the country club tan faded, the confident manner replaced by something grimmer.

We sat in his study and I told him everything I remembered. The payoff structures. The witness statements. The connections between City Hall and the police and the gambling ships. He wrote it down in careful longhand, asking questions when my memory faltered, filling in gaps from his own knowledge.

By the end, we had maybe twenty pages. A map of the corruption rather than a case or proof, but detailed enough that anyone who wanted to follow it could.

"What will you do with it?" I asked.

"There's a reporter at the Herald-Express. Young, ambitious, willing to take on Shaw. I'll give it to him. Let him decide if it's worth the risk."

"And if he publishes?"

Vernon Shaw looked at me with eyes that had seen too much. "Then at least it's out there. At least someone knows. Even if nothing changes, at least the truth is on the record."

I nodded. That was all any of us could hope for. The truth on the record. A marker in the sand, even as the tide came in to wash it away.

"You should leave the city, Malone." Vernon's voice was gentle. "You've done what you can. More than anyone could expect. There's no shame in walking away now."

I thought about it. Thought about getting on a train, heading east or north or anywhere that wasn't Los Angeles. Starting over in a city that didn't know my name or my failures.

"I'm not finished," I said.

"The case is finished. What's left?"

I didn't have an answer. Not one I could put into words. But the thought was still there, that strange certainty that had been growing since the flood:

Someone has to give a damn. Even if it doesn't change anything. Even if it's pointless.

Especially if it's pointless.

"I'll stay," I said. "A little while longer."

Vernon Shaw didn't argue. Maybe he understood. Or maybe he just knew there was no point trying to save a man who didn't want to be saved.

I drove back to Bunker Hill as the sun climbed toward noon. The streets were drying out, the mud hardening into ruts and ridges. The city was already forgetting the flood, already moving on to the next disaster, the next scandal, the next beautiful nightmare.

I parked my Buick in the alley behind my boarding house and climbed the stairs to my room. The door was locked, unchanged. No threatening notes, no evidence of intrusion.

But I knew they were watching. I knew they were waiting.

And I knew, with a certainty that went beyond logic or self-preservation, that I wasn't going to stop.

I didn't think I could win. I didn't believe in justice or redemption or any of the noble abstractions that men used to justify dying.

But someone had to try.

Just because the trying was not nothing.
