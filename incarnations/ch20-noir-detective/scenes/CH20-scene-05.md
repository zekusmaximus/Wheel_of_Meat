While I'd been in custody, someone had visited my office.

They'd been more thorough this time. The filing cabinet stood open, its contents scattered across the floor. The safe—which I'd thought was secure—had been forced open, the door hanging askew. Everything inside was gone: the money Vernon Shaw had given me, the copies of documents, the photographs, the witness statements. Two months of work, vanished.

I stood in the wreckage and felt something cold settle in my chest.

This wasn't just a warning anymore. This was erasure. Someone was trying to unmake my case, piece by piece, as if it had never existed. I could have told myself it wasn't as bad as it looked. Could have pretended there was still a path through the wreckage, a way to turn this around. But I'd learned, somewhere along the way, that denial was just postponed pain. The case was collapsing. That was real. What I did about it—that was still up to me.

The phone rang.

I picked it up without thinking, still staring at the violated safe.

"Malone?" Vernon Shaw's voice, thin and urgent. "I've been trying to reach you. I heard about the arrest—"

"They cleaned me out," I said. "Everything. The documents, the photographs, all of it. Someone broke into my safe while I was in holding."

A long silence on the other end of the line.

"How much do you have left?"

I looked around the office. At the papers scattered on the floor, most of them useless—old case files, receipts, letters from clients who'd moved on or died or simply forgotten I existed. At the empty safe, its interior mocking me with its bareness.

"My notes," I said. "The ones I kept on my person. Maybe a third of what I had. And my memory, for what that's worth."

Another silence. When Vernon spoke again, his voice had changed—harder, with a ragged edge to it.

"We're running out of time, Malone. The recall petition is due next month. If we don't have enough evidence by then—"

"I know."

"Can you rebuild it? The witness statements, the documentation—"

"Some of it. Maybe. If the witnesses are still willing to talk." I rubbed my jaw, the stubble rough against my palm. "Half of them have recanted or disappeared. The ones who are left are scared. After this, they're going to be more scared."

"We have to try."

I closed my eyes. Thought about Harry Raymond, lying in his hospital bed. Thought about Helen Marsh, burning in a canyon. Thought about Doyle and Muñoz and all the others who'd decided that silence was safer than speech.

"Yeah," I said. "We have to try."

Vernon started to thank me—to call me brave, to talk about what I'd sacrificed for the cause. I cut him off. "Don't. I'm just doing a job. The witnesses were the brave ones. The ones who are dead now." Making myself the hero of this story had a way of turning the story into something else. Let the reformers take the credit if there was any credit to take. I'd know what I'd done.

I left the office and walked.

The rain had stopped, but the streets were still wet, reflecting the gray sky and the neon signs that had started to flicker on even though it was barely noon. I walked without direction, letting my feet carry me while my mind worked through the wreckage of the case.

The pattern was undeniable now. It wasn't just bad luck, wasn't just the normal attrition of a corruption investigation. Someone was actively sabotaging me—someone who knew my moves before I made them, who could reach my witnesses before I did, who could crack my safe and destroy my evidence while I sat helpless in a holding cell.

The Combination was the obvious answer. They had the resources, the reach, the motivation. But the precision of it nagged at me. This wasn't the Combination's usual style—they preferred blunt force, intimidation, bullets and bombs. This was surgical. This was personal.

I was so lost in thought that I almost walked past her.

She was standing on the corner of Hill and Third, near the entrance to my office building. Dark hair caught in the wind, a coat that looked too expensive for this neighborhood, face turned slightly away from me. But there was something about the line of her profile—the sharp widow's peak, the single darker strand falling across her forehead—that made me stop.

The woman from the bar. The one who'd disappeared without leaving.

For a moment, our eyes almost met. I saw her face in profile, and something in my chest lurched—not recognition exactly, but the ghost of recognition, the sense that I knew her from somewhere I couldn't name. Her left eye caught the gray light, and I could have sworn I saw something strange in it, a flicker of color that didn't belong.

Then she turned and walked away, her heels clicking on the wet pavement, her figure receding into the midday crowd. I watched her go, rooted to the spot, unable to shake the feeling that she'd been waiting for me. That she'd wanted me to see her.

By the time I thought to follow, she was gone. Swallowed by the city, as if she'd never been there at all.

I stood on the corner for a long moment, rain beginning to fall again, trying to make sense of what I'd seen. A beautiful woman. A strange face. The feeling of being watched by eyes that knew more than they should.

It didn't fit anywhere. It was a loose thread in a case that was already unraveling.

I should have filed it away with all the other things I couldn't explain.

Instead, I stood on that corner while the rain soaked through my coat, and I thought about the blackmail case. Fifty dollars plus expenses. Good money. Clean money. The kind of case that kept the lights on while the Haversham investigation ate me alive.

But my hand wouldn't reach for the phone.

The woman's face—that widow's peak, that strange flicker in her left eye—lodged in my chest like a splinter I couldn't dig out. The blackmail case felt wrong. Not complicated-wrong. Wrong the way Frank's death had felt wrong. Wrong the way this whole investigation had felt wrong from the first minute, like I was walking through a maze someone else had designed.

*I've seen those eyes before.* I couldn't say where. But I knew not to trust them.

The thought arrived without explanation, certainty without evidence. The kind of knowing that got men killed in this city—acting on instinct instead of facts.

I let the phone ring through.

Made no sense. The money was good. The case was clean. And I needed rent money worse than I needed instincts I couldn't explain.

But something in me knew better than my brain did. Knew that case was a trap, even if I couldn't prove it. Knew that woman on the corner was connected to everything falling apart around me, even if I'd never spoken to her in my life.

*In France—*

I blinked. In France? I'd never been to France.

The thought slid away before I could catch it, leaving only residue. The blackmail case went to someone else. And I went back to the corruption investigation that was probably going to kill me.

*Someone has to give a damn. Even when it doesn't make sense. Even when you can't explain why.*

The rebuilding started that afternoon.

I called the witnesses who hadn't recanted—the three who were still willing to talk. Two of them agreed to give me new statements, though their voices were tight with fear, and both of them made me promise I wouldn't write down their names this time. The third, a junior accountant at City Hall, listened to my request and then hung up without a word.

I went back to the courthouse and found the documents I'd photographed, but the originals had been pulled from the files. "Misfiled," the clerk said, not meeting my eyes. "Sometimes things get lost."

I visited the newspaper morgue and requested the back issues I'd used, but half of them had been removed for "repair." The librarian couldn't tell me when they'd be back.

By evening, I had maybe a quarter of what I'd started with. Not enough to make the recall case. Not enough to bring down Shaw. But maybe enough to prove that something was rotten, that the corruption was real, that someone should investigate even if that someone couldn't be me.

I drove back to Bunker Hill as the sun set behind the downtown towers, painting the clouds orange and red. The Buick's engine coughed twice on the hill—needed a tune-up I couldn't afford—but it got me home. I parked in the alley and climbed the stairs to my room, every step feeling heavier than the last.

The door was unlocked again.

I drew my gun, pushed it open with my foot.

Empty. Nothing disturbed. But on my pillow, folded neatly, was a single sheet of paper.

I picked it up with hands that weren't quite steady.

Three words, typed on a machine that left no identifying marks:

STOP OR DIE

I crumpled the paper and threw it in the corner.

Then I poured myself a drink, sat on the edge of my bed, and started writing down everything I could remember. Every witness, every document, every connection I'd made. If they were going to kill me, I was going to make sure the case survived. I was going to put it all in a letter, seal it in an envelope, and leave it with someone I trusted—if I could find anyone in this city I still trusted.

Someone had to give a damn.

Even if it meant dying for nothing.
