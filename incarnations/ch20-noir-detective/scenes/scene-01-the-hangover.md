# Scene 1: The Hangover

I woke with the taste of failure in my mouth.

The rye had gone sour sometime during the night, mixing with the copper aftertaste of the blood I'd bitten from my cheek while sleeping. My tongue found the wound—small, raw, already scabbing. Another dreamless night of grinding my teeth through whatever my mind was trying to forget.

Gray light leaked through the gap in the curtains. Morning, probably. The radiator had quit again, leaving the room cold enough that my breath made small ghosts in the air above the pillow. I watched them rise and dissolve, postponing the moment when I'd have to swing my legs over the edge of the Murphy bed and face another day of being Jack Malone, private investigator, thirty-eight years old and running out of reasons to keep the title.

The ceiling had a new crack. Water damage from the storms last week, working its way through the old Victorian bones of this Bunker Hill boarding house. Mrs. Patterson would want someone to look at it. She wouldn't pay to have it fixed. The crack would spread, and eventually the ceiling would come down, and that would be that. Everything in this city was rotting from the inside out. You just had to decide how long you wanted to watch.

I sat up.

The room came into focus in pieces: the hot plate on the dresser with yesterday's coffee still in the pot, a skin of oil floating on top; the single wooden chair with my trousers draped over it, wrinkled beyond what any iron could fix; the washstand with its chipped basin and the mirror above it, which I made a point of not looking into before noon. The mirror showed things a man didn't need to see at this hour. How the gray had spread from his temples into the hair above his ears. How the lines around his eyes had stopped being character and started being age. How he looked, more and more, like his father had looked in the last years—hollow and waiting.

I rubbed my jaw, feeling the stubble rasp against my palm. Two days' growth, maybe three. I'd stopped counting.

The smell hit me when I stood: yesterday's cigarettes, the rye I'd spilled on the floor beside the bed, the general funk of a room that hadn't seen fresh air since Roosevelt's first term. Through it all, coming up from the street three floors below, the wet concrete smell that meant the rain had stopped overnight. Los Angeles in January. The city couldn't decide if it wanted to drown or burn.

I crossed to the window and pulled back the curtain.

Bunker Hill spread out below me in the early light, beautiful in the way a corpse is beautiful before it starts to rot. The old Victorian mansions climbed the slope like monuments to dead money, their painted ladies now carved up into boarding rooms and flophouses for people who couldn't afford the flatlands. Angels Flight sat halfway down the hill, its two orange cars frozen on their tracks, waiting for the first fare of the day. Beyond that, downtown Los Angeles gleamed in the distance—the Eastern Columbia Building, the City Hall tower, the movie palaces along Broadway. From up here, you couldn't see the breadlines. Couldn't smell the desperation that hung over Fifth Street like fog. Couldn't hear the police sirens that had become as common as birdsong in a city that had sold its soul to the Combination and called it progress.

I turned away from the window.

The newspaper was still on the floor where I'd thrown it last night, and for a moment I saw the headline again without having to pick it up: RAYMOND BOMBING WITNESS RECANTS. Two weeks since someone had wired a car bomb to former detective Harry Raymond's Buick, and the city was already forgetting. The witnesses who'd identified the cops involved were changing their stories. The investigation was going nowhere. Captain Earle Kynette and his Spy Squad would walk, and everyone who mattered would learn the lesson: don't investigate the Combination unless you want to die in a ball of fire.

I'd known Harry. Not well—we'd crossed paths a few times when I was still on the force, back when I thought being a good cop meant something. He'd been building a case against Mayor Shaw's machine, documenting the payoffs, the protection rackets, the straight line that ran from City Hall to the mob. Now he was in a hospital bed learning to breathe around the shrapnel in his lungs, and the men who'd tried to kill him were still drawing their city paychecks.

Twelve dollars.

That was what I had. Twelve dollars in the coffee can on top of the icebox, and rent due in three days. Six dollars a week for this palace of rot and radiator failure. Mrs. Patterson had already extended me once, after the Henderson divorce fell through. She wasn't the extending type.

I found my shirt on the floor, pulled it on, decided the tie could wait. The Colt Detective Special went into the shoulder holster—force of habit, though I hadn't fired it in anger since quitting the department two years ago. The trench coat covered the gun and most of the wrinkles. The fedora covered my hair, which had given up any pretense of cooperation.

The coffee was cold and bitter, but I drank it anyway, standing at the window, watching Angels Flight start its first run of the day. Five cents to ride down the hill to my office. Five cents more to ride back up tonight, if I could find five cents and a reason to come back.

Six months.

That's how long it had been since a case went right. The Delacroix missing person—found the man, turns out he didn't want to be found, turned out his wife didn't want him found once she saw what he'd been doing, turned out nobody wanted to pay me once the truth came out. The Kimball blackmail job—identified the blackmailer, client decided to pay instead of prosecute, blackmailer walked with the money and a smile. The Fontaine insurance fraud—had the proof, DA's office sat on it, eventually lost the file, case dismissed. One after another, month after month. Good work going nowhere. Results that turned to ash the moment I tried to hold them.

I'd started to think it was me. That I'd lost whatever edge I'd had as a cop. That the drink was finally catching up, or the sleepless nights, or just the accumulation of years in a city that ground down anyone who tried to stay clean.

What I didn't know—what I couldn't have known—was that none of it was accident. Somewhere, someone was making sure my cases failed. Making sure the witnesses recanted and the evidence disappeared and the clients backed out. Setting me up for something I couldn't see coming.

But that's not how it felt that January morning. That morning, standing in my cold room with bad coffee and twelve dollars and a headline about a good cop who'd gotten too close to the truth, it just felt like Los Angeles. It just felt like being Jack Malone.

I rinsed the coffee cup, left it in the basin, and headed for the door.

Angels Flight was running by the time I reached the top of the incline. The car named Sinai was waiting, its wooden benches empty except for an old Mexican woman with a basket of tamales she was probably taking down to sell on Spring Street. I dropped my nickel in the slot and took a seat near the front, watching the city rise up to meet me as we descended.

The woman was praying quietly, her lips moving over words I couldn't hear. Rosary beads clicked between her fingers, small and worn. She looked at me once, saw what I was—the rumpled coat, the unshaven face, the exhaustion that had become permanent—and went back to her prayers. I didn't blame her. If I believed in anything worth praying to, I'd have been doing the same.

The car reached the bottom of the hill, and I stepped out onto Hill Street, into the morning light and the sound of traffic and the smell of exhaust mixing with bacon from the diner across the way. My office was four blocks north, on the second floor of a building that had been grand once and was now merely standing. The elevator hadn't worked since Hoover was president. The stairs creaked in places that changed week to week, the building settling into its own slow collapse.

The frosted glass door still said JACK MALONE – PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS, which was optimistic of it. I unlocked the door and stepped inside, and that's when I saw them.

Two men, waiting.

They rose from the client chairs as I entered, and everything about them said trouble. Good suits—too good for Bunker Hill—and the careful, watchful manner of men who were used to being careful and watchful. The older one was fifty, maybe, with silver hair and the kind of tan you get from country club golf, not honest labor. The younger one was thirty, carrying a briefcase like it contained something that might explode.

"Mr. Malone." The older one extended his hand. His grip was firm, practiced. "I apologize for letting ourselves in. Your door was unlocked."

It hadn't been. I always locked it. But I wasn't going to argue with men in suits that cost more than my monthly rent.

"What can I do for you gentlemen?"

They looked at each other. The younger one set his briefcase on my desk, unopened.

"We'd like to hire you," the older one said. "To do something very dangerous, for very good money."

Outside, the sounds of the city continued—cars and streetcars and the distant wail of a siren, someone else's emergency, someone else's problem. I looked at the briefcase, then at the two men who'd come with it.

Rent was due in three days. Twelve dollars wouldn't cover it.

I should have told them no.

"I'm listening," I said.
