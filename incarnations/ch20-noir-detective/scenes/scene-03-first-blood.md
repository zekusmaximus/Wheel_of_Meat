# Scene 3: First Blood

The first week went better than I had any right to expect.

I started with the soft targets—the clerk, the bartender, the secretary. People who worked at the edges of the Combination's operations, who saw enough to be useful but weren't important enough to be protected. The clerk, a thin-faced little man named Doyle who worked in the assessor's office and couldn't stop drumming his fingers on the table, gave me a two-hour deposition about property transfers that had gone through his desk without proper documentation. The bartender—Muñoz, at a place called The Blue Parrot on Main Street—confirmed protection payments that matched the numbers in Vernon Shaw's folder. The secretary, Helen Marsh, had worked in Chief Davis's outer office for three years before transferring to a safer posting in the Parks Department. She knew things. She wanted to tell them.

I wrote everything down. Names, dates, amounts. The web of connections between City Hall and the police and the gambling operations and the floating casinos anchored off Santa Monica. Each interview confirmed something from the folder, added something new, pointed me toward another thread I hadn't known existed.

By the end of the week, I had enough material to fill a second folder. Enough to make the recall case stronger. Enough to make me a legitimate threat.

And that's when the other case walked through my door.

---

Her name was Margaret Sinclair, and she was the wrong kind of beautiful for a detective agency on Bunker Hill. Blonde hair waved like they did it in the pictures, a face that belonged on a movie poster, and clothes that cost more than my monthly rent. She sat in the client chair and twisted her gloves in her hands, and everything about her screamed money looking for trouble.

"My husband," she said. "Frank. He's been missing for three days."

I leaned back in my chair. "Have you talked to the police?"

"The police told me to wait. Said men go missing all the time, most of them turn up." Her voice cracked on the last word. "But Frank wouldn't do this. He wouldn't leave without telling me. Something's wrong."

I should have turned her away. The corruption case was taking all my time, and missing persons work is unpredictable—could be wrapped up in an afternoon, could drag on for weeks. But she was sitting there with tears threatening to spill from eyes the color of summer sky, and Frank Sinclair was someone's husband, and someone had to give a damn.

"Tell me about him," I said.

Frank Sinclair was an accountant. Forty-two years old, worked for a shipping firm downtown. No debts, no vices, no enemies that Margaret knew of. They'd been married fifteen years, no children. Frank left for work Tuesday morning like always. Never came home.

"I've called his office," she said. "They say he left at five o'clock, same as usual. But he drives, Mr. Malone, and his car was still in the parking structure when I went to look. Just sitting there. His briefcase was inside, his lunch pail. Everything except Frank."

I took notes. The shipping firm's name—Pacific Coast Transport—rang a faint bell somewhere in my memory, but I couldn't place it. The parking structure was downtown, on Spring Street, near enough to my office that I could walk it.

"Two hundred dollars," I said. "Retainer against twenty-five a day. If I find him fast, I'll refund what I don't use."

She didn't blink. Just opened her purse and counted out the bills with fingers that trembled slightly. I gave her a receipt and told her I'd be in touch.

After she left, I sat at my desk and stared at the notes I'd taken. Something about the case felt wrong—not the case itself, which was straightforward enough, but the timing of it. Six months of failing cases, then Vernon Shaw's reform money, and now a beautiful woman with a missing husband. Three pieces that didn't seem to connect but somehow felt like they should.

I filed the feeling away and went to work.

Finding Frank Sinclair took me two days.

He wasn't hard to trace. I started at the parking structure, bribed the attendant for his sign-out log (he hadn't signed out), then worked backward from there. The shipping firm was on a corner of Second Street, a squat brick building with Pacific Coast Transport painted on the windows in letters that had seen better decades. Frank's colleagues remembered him leaving at five. The receptionist had seen him heading toward the parking structure. Nobody remembered anything unusual.

I spent the afternoon canvassing the blocks between the office and the garage. A shoeshine boy remembered a man matching Frank's description talking to another man on the corner of Second and Spring, around five-fifteen. They'd gotten into a car together. The shoeshine boy hadn't thought anything of it—businessmen got into cars all the time.

The car was a Packard, dark green, California plates. That narrowed it down to about ten thousand cars in Los Angeles County.

The second day, I got lucky. A beat cop I knew from my time on the force, one of the few who wasn't on the Combination's payroll, remembered a drunk and disorderly call from a flophouse on Fifth Street. The man had been raving about "Frank" and "the shipping company" and "they'll kill us both." The cops had let him sleep it off and released him in the morning.

I found the flophouse. The clerk remembered the drunk—middle-aged, looked like he hadn't eaten in days, kept mumbling about numbers and ledgers. He'd checked out that morning, but the clerk had seen him head south toward the Mission District.

I worked the missions for the rest of the day. The third one, a place called Saint Vincent's, had given a meal to a man matching the description. He'd told the volunteer his name was Eddie Garza, and he was hiding from people who wanted to hurt him.

Eddie Garza. I knew that name. It was on Vernon Shaw's list—a bookkeeper who'd worked for one of the Combination's front businesses before having a crisis of conscience. He'd been scheduled for an interview next week.

The connection clicked into place like a key finding its lock.

Frank Sinclair, accountant for a shipping company. Eddie Garza, bookkeeper for the mob. Both men who worked with numbers, both men who'd seen things they shouldn't have seen. The shipping company—Pacific Coast Transport—I remembered now where I'd heard the name. It was in the folder. One of the businesses suspected of laundering Combination money.

Frank Sinclair hadn't gone missing. He'd run. And Eddie Garza was running too, from the same people, for the same reasons.

I found Eddie Garza in an alley behind a Chinese restaurant on Alameda Street, huddled against a dumpster with a bottle of rotgut whiskey clutched in his hand. He was a small man, Hispanic, maybe fifty, with the hollow eyes and shaking hands of someone who'd stopped sleeping weeks ago.

"You Malone?" He looked up at me without surprise, as if he'd been expecting someone like me to find him eventually. "Frank said you might come."

"Frank Sinclair?"

"We were going to the reformers together. Had it all planned. The ledgers, the names, everything. Then they found out." He took a long pull from the bottle. "I don't know how, but they found out. Frank went to get his car and never came back."

"Where is he now?"

Eddie Garza's eyes went flat. "You haven't heard?"

A cold weight settled in my stomach. "Heard what?"

"They found him this morning. In an alley off Sixth Street." Eddie's voice dropped to a whisper. "Cops are calling it a robbery gone wrong. But there wasn't any robbery, Malone. They beat him and they killed him and they left him in the trash like garbage."

---

I called Margaret Sinclair from a payphone on Spring Street.

The conversation lasted three minutes. I told her I'd found her husband. I told her where the body was. I told her I was sorry. She made a sound on the other end of the line that wasn't quite a scream and wasn't quite a sob, and then she hung up.

I stood in the phone booth for a long time after that, listening to the dial tone. Thinking about Frank Sinclair, who'd seen something wrong and tried to do something right, and died in an alley for his trouble. Thinking about Eddie Garza, shaking in that alley, waiting for his turn.

Thinking about the fact that I'd found Frank Sinclair in two days, and it hadn't made a damn bit of difference.

When I went to the police station to file my report, the desk sergeant looked at me like I was something he'd scraped off his shoe.

"Sinclair case?" He didn't bother checking his notes. "Robbery homicide. Case closed."

"He was a witness in a corruption investigation. He was—"

"Case closed, Malone." The sergeant's voice went cold. "Unless you want to make a statement about your own involvement in whatever got him killed."

I left.

The next morning, Margaret Sinclair called my office. Her voice was different now—flat, controlled, empty of everything that had made her seem human two days ago.

"I never hired you, Mr. Malone."

"Ma'am—"

"I never hired you. I don't know who you are. Please don't contact me again."

The line went dead.

That afternoon, I sat in a bar on Main Street and tried to make sense of what had happened. The corruption case was still alive—none of my witnesses had recanted yet, none of the evidence had disappeared. But Frank Sinclair was dead, Margaret Sinclair had erased me from her memory, and Eddie Garza had vanished from the alley where I'd found him, leaving nothing behind but an empty whiskey bottle and a bloodstain that might have been his or might have been someone else's.

The bar was dim and smoky, the kind of place where people came to disappear for a few hours. I was working on my second rye when I noticed her.

She was sitting in a booth across the room. Dark hair styled in victory rolls, a dress that caught what little light there was in the place. Beautiful, in a way that made you want to look twice, then look away, then look back again. Her face was angled toward the window, but I could see the sharp line of her widow's peak, the single darker strand that fell across her forehead.

Something about her tugged at my attention. Not attraction—or not just attraction. Something else. A sense of recognition I couldn't place, like seeing a face in a dream and knowing it means something without knowing what.

I watched her for a long moment. She didn't look at me. Didn't seem to notice I was there at all. She was watching the street outside, her expression unreadable, her hands wrapped around a glass she hadn't touched.

Then someone walked between us—another patron heading for the bar—and when the sightline cleared, she was gone. The booth was empty. The glass sat on the table, still full, condensation running down its sides.

I hadn't seen her leave.

I paid for my drinks and went back to my office, the image of her face lodged somewhere behind my eyes like a splinter I couldn't quite reach.

---

The corruption case moved forward. I interviewed three more witnesses that week. Got solid statements from two of them. The third—a police sergeant who'd been willing to talk about payoff schedules—called me the morning of our meeting to say he'd changed his mind.

"Sorry, Malone. Can't do it. Just... can't."

He hung up before I could ask what had changed.

But the other interviews were good. The evidence was building. Vernon Shaw called to check in, and I told him we were making progress, and he sounded pleased.

I didn't tell him about Frank Sinclair. About the missing person case that had turned into a murder I couldn't solve and a wife who'd pretended I didn't exist. About the police sergeant who'd changed his mind for reasons he couldn't or wouldn't explain.

I didn't tell him about the woman in the bar, either. The one who'd disappeared without leaving.

Some things don't fit into reports. Some things you file away and try not to think about until they make sense.

Frank Sinclair's body was released to his wife three days later. The funeral was small—just Margaret and a few family members, standing in the rain at Forest Lawn while a minister said words that didn't mean anything. I watched from a distance, standing under a tree at the edge of the cemetery, and wondered if I should have refused the case. If Frank would still be alive if I'd never started looking for him.

The answer was no, probably. He'd been marked the moment he decided to talk. But the wondering was there anyway, a weight I couldn't put down.

Someone had to give a damn.

Even when giving a damn got people killed.
