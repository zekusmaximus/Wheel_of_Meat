The last two weeks of my life were strangely peaceful.

Not calm, exactly—there was still work to do, still witnesses to track down, still pages of notes to transcribe and pass along to Shaw's network. But beneath the activity, beneath the fear and the exhaustion, there was something else. A kind of settled certainty that I couldn't quite name.

I woke each morning knowing that it might be my last, and somehow that made each morning clearer. The coffee tasted sharper. The rain on the windows looked more beautiful. The small kindnesses of strangers—a smile from the woman who sold newspapers on the corner, a nod from a fellow rider on Angels Flight—seemed precious in a way they never had before.

I kept a letter in my pocket, updated every few days. Not a confession or a farewell, just an accounting: what I knew, who I'd talked to, what I'd learned. If they found my body, I wanted someone to find the letter too. Wanted the truth to survive even if I didn't.

Someone has to give a damn.

The phrase ran through my head like a mantra now. I didn't know where it came from—didn't remember ever deciding to believe it—but it was there, constant and sure. Not just about the corruption case, not just about Los Angeles. About everything. About the way a man should live, whether he had fifty years left or five days.

You couldn't fix the world. You couldn't save everyone. You couldn't even save yourself.

But you could try. You could keep trying, even when trying was pointless. You could refuse to stop caring, even when caring cost you everything.

That was worth something. Maybe it was worth everything.

The morning it happened, I knew.

Not how or when—just that this was the day. I felt it the way you feel a storm coming, a pressure change in the air, a weight against your skin that hasn't quite become rain.

I dressed carefully. Clean shirt, pressed suit, the gray fedora that had seen me through two years of private work and sixteen years on the force before that. I checked my gun—not the Colt, which they'd taken, but a backup piece I'd picked up at a pawnshop, a cheap .32 that would do in a pinch.

Then I sat at my desk and wrote one more letter.

Not to Vernon Shaw. Not to the reporter or the police or anyone who could do anything with the information.

To no one. To whoever might find it. To the universe, maybe, if the universe was listening.

*I don't know who will read this, or if anyone will. But I want to say something before I go.*

*I've been a cop and a soldier and a private detective. I've seen people at their worst and, occasionally, at their best. I've failed more cases than I've solved, lost more fights than I've won. I'm going to die today, probably, and when I do, the corruption I've been fighting will still be standing. Nothing I've done will change that.*

*But here's what I've learned, in these last few weeks, as everything fell apart:*

*The trying matters. Not because it succeeds. Not because it changes anything. Just because someone has to try. Someone has to look at what's wrong and say it's wrong, even if saying it gets you killed. Someone has to give a damn, even when giving a damn is pointless.*

*I didn't save anyone. Every case I worked this year went south. Every witness I tried to protect ended up dead or running. I'm going to die with nothing to show for any of it.*

*But the trying was not nothing.*

*I don't know why that feels true. It feels older than me, deeper than anything I could have figured out on my own. Like an echo from somewhere I've never been. Like a promise I made a long time ago and don't remember making.*

*Whoever you are, wherever you are: keep trying. Even when it's pointless. Especially when it's pointless.*

*Someone has to give a damn.*

*Someone will.*

I folded the letter and put it in my inside coat pocket, next to my heart.

Then I went downstairs to get my car.

---

The Buick Roadmaster was parked in the alley behind the boarding house, where it had been for three days. I hadn't driven it since the flood—hadn't needed to, hadn't wanted to. But today I was going to meet Vernon Shaw one last time, to hand over the final batch of notes, and the streetcar wouldn't get me there fast enough.

The rain had started again. Not hard, just a steady drizzle that made the world look like it was crying. I pulled my hat down and my collar up and walked through the mud to where the Buick sat waiting.

It was a beautiful car, even now. Three years old, but I'd kept it polished, kept the chrome shining. The rain beaded on the black hood like tears on a mourner's cheek. I'd bought it from a widow on Hope Street, a woman whose husband had died and left her nothing but debts and this one extravagance. She'd needed the money. I'd needed the car. Los Angeles, making trades.

I unlocked the door and slid behind the wheel.

The interior smelled of old leather and cigarettes and the faint mustiness of a car that had been sitting too long. The seat creaked as I settled into it. The steering wheel was cold under my hands.

I looked out the windshield at the rain falling on the alley, at the back of the boarding house, at the gray morning light that seemed to promise nothing good.

And then I saw her.

She was standing on the sidewalk at the end of the alley, near where it opened onto Hill Street. A woman in a dark coat, dark hair visible under the brim of a fashionable hat. She was looking at me.

The same woman. The one from the bar, from the street corner. The one who kept appearing and disappearing like a ghost.

This time, I could see her face clearly. The sharp widow's peak. The single darker strand that fell across her forehead despite the rain. Her eyes, fixed on mine across fifty feet of wet pavement—and in one of them, the left one, something strange. A flicker of color that didn't belong. Green, maybe, a pale crescent of green in an iris that should have been brown.

She knew.

I don't know how I knew she knew, but I did. She was waiting for something. Watching for something. And whatever it was, it was about to happen.

Our eyes held for one long moment. Then she started to move—not toward me, but away, turning, beginning to walk quickly down the sidewalk, as if she could see what was coming and wanted to be gone before it arrived.

A passerby, rushing to avoid.

I turned the key.

---

The world became light.

I don't remember the sound—the detonation was too close, too sudden, for my ears to process as noise. Just brightness, overwhelming, filling my vision like a second sun had been born beneath the hood of my car. Then pressure, a wave of force that picked me up and threw me somewhere I couldn't track.

Then pain.

I was lying on the pavement. I knew that without opening my eyes. Wet and cold and hard beneath my back, rain falling on my face. The Buick was burning—I could hear it now, a crackling roar, could smell the gasoline and rubber and metal turning to smoke.

I tried to move. My body responded wrong, signals scrambling, limbs not finding their proper places. Something was broken in my chest. Something was bleeding, a lot, warm and wet mixing with the rain.

I opened my eyes.

The sky was gray. The rain fell straight down, each drop hitting my face like a tiny cold finger. I could see the flames from the car, orange and yellow against the gray, throwing shadows that danced on the walls of the alley.

Footsteps. Someone running toward me, then stopping. A face above me—not the woman, someone else, a stranger, eyes wide with shock.

"Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. Someone call an ambulance!"

The face disappeared. More footsteps, more voices. The sounds of a city reacting to violence, the same sounds I'd heard a hundred times as a cop. Sirens in the distance, getting closer or maybe just imagined.

I lay on the pavement and looked at the sky and felt my life leaving me.

---

The pain was fading.

That was the first sign, the one I recognized from the war—the way bad wounds stop hurting when there's not enough blood left to carry the signals. My body was shutting down, system by system, conserving what little it had for the parts that still needed to work.

My eyes still worked. I could see the rain. Could see the flames dying as someone threw a blanket over the burning car. Could see shapes moving at the edge of my vision, people gathering, the audience that always appears when someone dies in public.

And at the edge of the crowd, standing apart, the woman.

She hadn't left. She was watching me from the sidewalk, her face unreadable, her strange eyes fixed on mine. There was something in her expression—not satisfaction, not grief, something else. Recognition, maybe. Or understanding.

She knew who I was. Not just Jack Malone, private detective. Something else. Something older.

The thought should have frightened me, but I was beyond fear now. Beyond everything except this moment, this rain, this slow departure.

I closed my eyes.

---

In the darkness behind my eyelids, something shifted.

Not memory, exactly. Deeper than memory. A sense of vastness, of connection, of threads running backward through time to places I couldn't name but somehow knew.

Other lives. Other deaths. Other hands reaching out in the final moments, grasping for something they couldn't find.

I saw a temple floor, stone cold beneath a dying man's back. I saw a battlefield, mud and blood and the screams of the wounded. I saw a plague city, a desert cave, a philosopher's cell, a palace chamber, a ship in a storm. I saw lives stacked upon lives, deaths upon deaths, the same soul learning the same lessons in a thousand different bodies.

And I understood.

Not the details—those were beyond me, fading even as they appeared. But the shape of it. The pattern.

I'd been trying for a long time. Longer than this life, longer than I could imagine. Trying to help, trying to fix, trying to make things right in worlds that resisted being fixed. And failing. Always failing. Every life, every effort, ending in death and defeat and the certainty that nothing had changed.

But the trying mattered.

That was the lesson. The one I'd been learning since before I could remember. Not that you could succeed—success was an illusion, a horizon that receded as you approached. But that the effort itself had weight. Had meaning. Had value beyond any outcome it might achieve.

The trying was not nothing.

I felt something loosen in my chest. Not the broken ribs, not the collapsing lungs. Something else. A chain I'd been carrying so long I'd forgotten it was there. The need to be the one who fixed things, saved things, made the difference—a grip I'd held so tight my fingers had gone numb.

The chain of identity. The belief that there was a "me" separate from the trying, a self that needed to be preserved and protected and proven right.

It was loosening. Almost breaking. One more push, one more life, and it would snap.

And then—

What? I didn't know. Couldn't know. But I could feel it waiting, just beyond the edge of this life, a door that had been locked for ages and was finally coming open.

I will try again.

The thought arose without effort, without decision. A promise to something I couldn't name. A commitment that went beyond this body, this life, this death.

I will try again. I will keep trying. And someday—soon—the trying will finally be enough.

---

The rain fell on my face like baptism.

My blood was spreading on the pavement, mixing with the water, washing away. I could feel myself getting lighter, the weight of the body becoming irrelevant, the pain fading into a kind of distant music.

Voices above me, urgent, meaningless. Sirens getting closer. Someone was pressing something against my chest, trying to stop the bleeding, but it was too late for that. I'd been a cop long enough to know a fatal wound when I felt one.

I opened my eyes one last time.

The woman was still there. Still watching. But she was further away now, or maybe I was further away. She was receding into the rain, into the gray, her face becoming less distinct, her eyes fading from strange to ordinary to invisible.

A passerby. A witness. Nothing more.

But she knew. And I knew. And in that knowing was something that mattered more than all the evidence I'd gathered, all the cases I'd failed, all the people I hadn't managed to save.

The trying was not nothing.

I didn't save anyone. The Combination would survive. The corruption would continue. Nothing I did made any difference at all.

But the trying was not nothing.

I closed my eyes.

The rain kept falling. The sirens arrived. The crowd pressed closer, and somewhere in the noise and chaos, Jack Malone, age thirty-eight, private detective, stopped breathing.

---

The body lay on the wet pavement for a long time after that.

The ambulance came and went—there was nothing to be done, the medics said, he was gone before they arrived. The police came too, taking photographs, making notes, treating it as what it obviously was: another car bombing in a city that had seen too many. The reporter from the Herald-Express showed up, asked a few questions, wrote a story that would run on page eight the next morning.

The rain kept falling.

And somewhere else—somewhere that had no name, no location, no existence in any geography the living could map—something stirred.

A momentum that had been building for millennia. A pattern that had been waiting for completion. Lifetimes of failure that were also preparation. Fires that had refined instead of destroyed.

And now, finally: the urge that would carry forward into the next life. The certainty that the trying mattered. The readiness to break the chains that remained.

Someone has to give a damn.

I will try again.

The rain fell on the empty body. The city went on with its business. The corruption continued and the corrupt prospered and nothing changed.

But somewhere, in a way that no one in Los Angeles would ever understand, everything had changed.

The wheel turned.

A new life began.
