They were waiting outside my office door when I reached the top of the stairs—two men in suits that cost more than my car. Not cops. Cops don't wear Italian leather shoes, and they don't stand with that particular brand of nervous stillness that comes from carrying information instead of weapons.
The taller one turned when he heard me coming. Mid-forties, gray at the temples, face like a Presbyterian minister who'd seen too many confessions he couldn't absolve. But underneath the righteousness, something else—the particular exhaustion of a man who'd buried friends and kept going anyway. Not a true believer. A man who'd stopped believing but couldn't stop trying. I knew that face. I wore it myself most mornings.
His companion was younger, thirty maybe, with the kind of earnest jaw that newspapers liked to photograph and the kind of restless hands that couldn't stop moving. That one still believed. You could see it in how his energy leaked out through his fingers, drumming against his thigh—the nervous charge of someone who thought justice was coming if they just pushed hard enough. He'd learn. They always did.
"Mr. Malone?" The tall one extended his hand. "Vernon Shaw. This is David Brennan."
I shook his hand and unlocked the door. The office smelled like old cigarettes and failure—which was accurate enough. I'd left the window cracked overnight, hoping the rain would wash some of the staleness out, but all it had done was let the damp in. The papers on my desk had curled at the edges.
"Sit down," I said. "Coffee?"
They sat. Shaw crossed his legs at the ankle, precise—a man who'd learned to control what he could control when everything else was spinning out. Brennan perched on the edge of his chair like he might need to bolt at any moment. I lit the hot plate under the percolator and waited.
"We've heard about you," Shaw said. "From several sources. They say you're honest."
"Honest and broke tend to go together in this town."
"They also say you were a good cop. Before."
I found two cups that weren't chipped too badly and set them on the desk. The percolator started making noises like a dying cat. "Before I quit, you mean. Or before the department made it clear I should."
Shaw nodded. He had the grace not to ask why. In Los Angeles, the reasons a good cop quit were usually the same reasons a bad cop got promoted.
"We're with the Civic Reform Committee," he said. "The recall movement."
The coffee finished percolating. I poured two cups and handed them over. Brennan wrapped both hands around his like he was cold, though the morning was mild. Shaw took his black and didn't drink.
"I know who you are," I said. "I read the papers."
"Then you know what we're trying to do. Mayor Shaw—no relation—has turned this city into his personal bank account. The police are his collection agents. The Combination runs vice with official protection, and anyone who speaks up ends up in the river or the desert or a hospital bed."
"Harry Raymond," I said.
Brennan's hands tightened on his cup. Shaw's face didn't change, but something behind his eyes did—a flicker of something that might have been anger or might have been fear.
"Harry Raymond," Shaw agreed. "Car bomb. Three weeks ago. He's still in the hospital. The doctors say he'll live, but he won't walk right again." He paused. "Captain Kynette ordered that bomb. We can't prove it yet, but we know."
"Everyone knows," I said. "Knowing doesn't change anything in this town."
"It could. If we had enough evidence. If we could give the grand jury something solid—payoff records, witness statements, photographs. The recall petition is due in ninety days. We need ammunition."
Shaw leaned forward, and now I could see the fire under the exhaustion—the thing that kept him moving when the smart play was to walk away. "We need to galvanize the citizens, bring the people together for—"
Something in my gut clenched. For a moment the office smelled wrong: dust and incense and too many bodies packed into a space meant for prayer, voices raised in unison promising heaven while the ground turned to mud and blood. I gripped the edge of my desk until it passed.
"Mr. Malone? Are you alright?"
"Fine." I loosened my grip, flexed my fingers. "Just thinking about how movements tend to end. Usually badly, usually for the people at the bottom who believed the loudest."
Shaw studied me for a moment, and I saw him filing that away—another data point about the man he was trying to hire. Smart. Careful. The kind of man who survived by paying attention.
"We're not selling salvation," he said quietly. "Just accountability. There's a difference."
I sat down behind my desk and looked at them. Two men in expensive suits, sitting in a shabby office on Bunker Hill, asking a broken-down ex-cop to do what the entire judicial system couldn't. They had to be desperate or stupid. Probably both.
"You understand what you're asking," I said. "Raymond was investigating the same thing. Look where it got him."
"We understand."
"The Combination doesn't issue warnings twice. First time, they bomb your car. Second time, they make sure you're in it."
Shaw reached into his jacket and pulled out an envelope. "Mr. Malone, we've been through six investigators in eighteen months. Two quit. Two disappeared. One turned up floating in the LA River with his tongue cut out. The last one—" He stopped, took a breath. "The last one decided the Combination's money was greener than ours. He's working for them now."
"And you think I'm different."
"We think you're the kind of man who quit a good pension because you couldn't stomach one more cover-up." He set the envelope on my desk. "Twenty-five dollars a day, plus expenses. The retainer is five hundred. Whatever happens, it's yours."
Five hundred dollars. That was three months' rent. Six months' groceries. A year of the kind of careful poverty I'd been practicing since I turned in my badge.
I looked at the envelope lying on my desk. I thought about Harry Raymond, lying in his hospital bed with his legs broken and his career finished. I thought about the six investigators before me—the dead ones, the bought ones, the smart ones who walked away.
I thought about the boy in the alley last night. The one the cops had beaten bloody for being in the wrong place with the wrong skin color. I thought about the woman who'd come to my office last month, looking for her daughter, who'd ended up working one of the Combination's houses because she couldn't find any other job that would take a Mexican girl with an eighth-grade education. I thought about sixteen years of watching the same rotten system grind up anyone who tried to change it.
Someone had to give a damn. Even when giving a damn was a death sentence.
I picked up the envelope.
"I'll take the case," I said. "But I should be honest with you: I don't know if I can win this. The odds aren't good. The system's rigged, and the house always wins in this town. I've been losing cases for six months straight—witnesses disappear, evidence vanishes, clients get cold feet. Could be bad luck. Could be something else. Either way, you should know what you're buying."
Shaw and Brennan exchanged a glance. Some silent communication passed between them.
"We know the odds," Shaw said. "We've buried friends already."
"As long as we're clear. I'll give you everything I've got. That might not be enough."
"It's more than anyone else has offered."
I opened my desk drawer and pulled out a notepad. "Then let's get started. I'll need names—everyone you've got who might be willing to talk. City Hall employees, police officers, anyone with access to payroll records or meeting schedules. I'll need everything you have on Combination operations—locations, personnel, payment schedules. And I'll need you to understand something."
"Name it."
"When they come for me—and they will—you don't know my name. You've never heard of me. Whatever I find, I'll get to you, but you burn it if I don't survive to testify." I uncapped my pen. "This isn't a case anymore. It's a war. And wars have casualties."
They gave me names. Half a dozen city employees who'd hinted they might talk if someone protected them. Three police officers who'd been passed over for promotion because they wouldn't play ball. A secretary in the mayor's office who'd been keeping copies of documents she shouldn't have. An accountant at one of the Combination's front companies who was drinking himself to death and might welcome a chance at redemption before he finished the job.
I wrote it all down. Names, addresses, phone numbers, the thin spider-web of people who wanted to do the right thing but were too scared to do it alone.
When they left, I sat at my desk and looked at the list. Fourteen names. Fourteen people who'd trusted someone they'd never met with their safety, their careers, maybe their lives.
The envelope sat beside the notepad, thick with cash I hadn't counted yet.
I poured myself another cup of coffee and started making phone calls.
Half the names would be dead by March. I didn't know that yet. I should have.
