# Scene 5: The Pattern Emerges

The arrests started in the third week of February.

They came for me on a Tuesday, two plainclothes detectives from Central Division who didn't bother showing badges until we were already in the back of their unmarked car. The charge was vagrancy—a bullshit catch-all the LAPD used when they wanted to hold someone without actually having to prove anything.

"You're making a mistake," I said.

The bigger of the two detectives—a thick-necked Irishman named Burke, who I'd worked with briefly back when I was on the force—backhanded me across the mouth. The taste of blood, copper and warm, filled my mouth.

"The mistake was yours, Malone. Sticking your nose where it doesn't belong."

They held me for eighteen hours. No phone call, no lawyer, no explanation beyond Burke's assertion that I was "a known troublemaker" who needed to learn his place. They put me in a holding cell with three drunks and a man who'd been picked up for public indecency, and they left me there while the hours crawled past.

The interrogation came at midnight.

Captain Earle Kynette himself conducted it—the head of the Spy Squad, the man whose unit had wired Harry Raymond's car and nearly killed him. Kynette was slim, dark-haired, with the kind of flat eyes that made you think of a snake deciding whether you were worth the effort of biting.

"You've been busy, Malone." He sat across from me in the interrogation room, the single bare bulb throwing harsh shadows across his face. "Talking to people. Writing things down. Making copies of documents that don't belong to you."

"I'm a private investigator. Investigating is what I do."

"What you're doing is interfering with the efficient operation of city government." He smiled, the expression carrying no warmth. "That's a crime, Malone. Maybe not one that's written down in any law book, but it's a crime all the same."

I said nothing. There was nothing to say.

Kynette leaned forward. "I'm going to give you some advice, because I'm a reasonable man. Walk away. Whatever case you think you're building, whatever evidence you think you have—let it go. Take a vacation. Go somewhere nice, somewhere far away, and stay there until the recall election is over. Do that, and nothing happens to you. Keep going, and..."

He spread his hands, the gesture carrying a world of implied violence.

"I've heard this speech before," I said. "Harry Raymond heard it too. He didn't listen, and someone put a bomb in his car."

"Harry Raymond was a stubborn man." Kynette's smile didn't waver. "Stubborn men don't live long in this town."

They released me at dawn, without charges, without explanation. I walked out of the station into gray morning light and rain that had started sometime during the night. My suit was wrinkled, my face was bruised where Burke had hit me, and my mouth tasted like old blood and bad coffee.

But I was alive. And I wasn't going to quit.

While I'd been in custody, someone had visited my office.

They'd been more thorough this time. The filing cabinet stood open, its contents scattered across the floor. The safe—which I'd thought was secure—had been forced open, the door hanging askew. Everything inside was gone: the money Vernon Shaw had given me, the copies of documents, the photographs, the witness statements. Two months of work, vanished.

I stood in the wreckage and felt something cold settle in my chest.

This wasn't just a warning anymore. This was erasure. Someone was trying to unmake my case, piece by piece, as if it had never existed.

The phone rang.

I picked it up without thinking, still staring at the violated safe.

"Malone?" Vernon Shaw's voice, thin and urgent. "I've been trying to reach you. I heard about the arrest—"

"They cleaned me out," I said. "Everything. The documents, the photographs, all of it. Someone broke into my safe while I was in holding."

A long silence on the other end of the line.

"How much do you have left?"

I looked around the office. At the papers scattered on the floor, most of them useless—old case files, receipts, letters from clients who'd moved on or died or simply forgotten I existed. At the empty safe, its interior mocking me with its bareness.

"My notes," I said. "The ones I kept on my person. Maybe a third of what I had. And my memory, for what that's worth."

Another silence. When Vernon spoke again, his voice had changed—harder, with a ragged edge to it.

"We're running out of time, Malone. The recall petition is due next month. If we don't have enough evidence by then—"

"I know."

"Can you rebuild it? The witness statements, the documentation—"

"Some of it. Maybe. If the witnesses are still willing to talk." I rubbed my jaw, the stubble rough against my palm. "Half of them have recanted or disappeared. The ones who are left are scared. After this, they're going to be more scared."

"We have to try."

I closed my eyes. Thought about Harry Raymond, lying in his hospital bed. Thought about Helen Marsh, burning in a canyon. Thought about Doyle and Muñoz and all the others who'd decided that silence was safer than speech.

"Yeah," I said. "We have to try."

I left the office and walked.

The rain had stopped, but the streets were still wet, reflecting the gray sky and the neon signs that had started to flicker on even though it was barely noon. I walked without direction, letting my feet carry me while my mind worked through the wreckage of the case.

The pattern was undeniable now. It wasn't just bad luck, wasn't just the normal attrition of a corruption investigation. Someone was actively sabotaging me—someone who knew my moves before I made them, who could reach my witnesses before I did, who could crack my safe and destroy my evidence while I sat helpless in a holding cell.

The Combination was the obvious answer. They had the resources, the reach, the motivation. But the precision of it nagged at me. This wasn't the Combination's usual style—they preferred blunt force, intimidation, bullets and bombs. This was surgical. This was personal.

I was so lost in thought that I almost walked past her.

She was standing on the corner of Hill and Third, near the entrance to my office building. Dark hair caught in the wind, a coat that looked too expensive for this neighborhood, face turned slightly away from me. But there was something about the line of her profile—the sharp widow's peak, the single darker strand falling across her forehead—that made me stop.

The woman from the bar. The one who'd disappeared without leaving.

For a moment, our eyes almost met. I saw her face in profile, and something in my chest lurched—not recognition exactly, but the ghost of recognition, the sense that I knew her from somewhere I couldn't name. Her left eye caught the gray light, and I could have sworn I saw something strange in it, a flicker of color that didn't belong.

Then she turned and walked away, her heels clicking on the wet pavement, her figure receding into the midday crowd. I watched her go, rooted to the spot, unable to shake the feeling that she'd been waiting for me. That she'd wanted me to see her.

By the time I thought to follow, she was gone. Swallowed by the city, as if she'd never been there at all.

I stood on the corner for a long moment, rain beginning to fall again, trying to make sense of what I'd seen. A beautiful woman. A strange face. The feeling of being watched by eyes that knew more than they should.

It didn't fit anywhere. It was a loose thread in a case that was already unraveling.

I filed it away with all the other things I couldn't explain and went back to work.

The rebuilding started that afternoon.

I called the witnesses who hadn't recanted—the three who were still willing to talk. Two of them agreed to give me new statements, though their voices were tight with fear, and both of them made me promise I wouldn't write down their names this time. The third, a junior accountant at City Hall, listened to my request and then hung up without a word.

I went back to the courthouse and found the documents I'd photographed, but the originals had been pulled from the files. "Misfiled," the clerk said, not meeting my eyes. "Sometimes things get lost."

I visited the newspaper morgue and requested the back issues I'd used, but half of them had been removed for "repair." The librarian couldn't tell me when they'd be back.

By evening, I had maybe a quarter of what I'd started with. Not enough to make the recall case. Not enough to bring down Shaw. But maybe enough to prove that something was rotten, that the corruption was real, that someone should investigate even if that someone couldn't be me.

I drove back to Bunker Hill as the sun set behind the downtown towers, painting the clouds orange and red. The Buick's engine coughed twice on the hill—needed a tune-up I couldn't afford—but it got me home. I parked in the alley and climbed the stairs to my room, every step feeling heavier than the last.

The door was unlocked again.

I drew my gun, pushed it open with my foot.

Empty. Nothing disturbed. But on my pillow, folded neatly, was a single sheet of paper.

I picked it up with hands that weren't quite steady.

Three words, typed on a machine that left no identifying marks:

STOP OR DIE

I crumpled the paper and threw it in the corner.

Then I poured myself a drink, sat on the edge of my bed, and started writing down everything I could remember. Every witness, every document, every connection I'd made. If they were going to kill me, I was going to make sure the case survived. I was going to put it all in a letter, seal it in an envelope, and leave it with someone I trusted—if I could find anyone in this city I still trusted.

Someone had to give a damn.

Even if it meant dying for nothing.
