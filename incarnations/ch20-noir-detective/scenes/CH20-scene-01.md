I woke up with the taste of failure in my mouth and the smell of yesterday's whiskey in my lungs. The rain had stopped sometime during the night, but the city still smelled like wet concrete and broken promises. Rent was due in three days. I had twelve dollars to my name and a splitting headache that felt like divine punishment.
The Murphy bed groaned when I sat up, springs protesting like they had their own grievances to file. Gray light seeped through the window, turning my room into a study in shades of defeat. One suit hanging in the closet—the other at the cleaners, assuming they hadn't sold it for the back payment I owed. Hot plate on the dresser, half a can of Folger's beside it. Walls thin enough to hear Mrs. Kowalski coughing two doors down, same wet rattle she'd had since October.
I rubbed my jaw—stubble like sandpaper, two days' worth—and tried to remember exactly how last night had gone wrong.
The newspaper on Mrs. Kowalski's doormat caught my eye through the crack under my door—headline screaming about some rally downtown, thousands gathering for the cause du jour. My stomach turned, sudden and sharp, and for a moment I tasted something that wasn't whiskey: dust, blood, the smell of bodies too close together. I shut my eyes until it passed. Crowds and their heavenly promises. Nothing good ever came from that many people believing the same thing at once.
The witness. Helen Marsh, thirty-four, secretary to a city councilman with his hand in three different tills. She'd agreed to talk. Had documents, she said. Photographs. The kind of evidence that could crack the whole Combination wide open, if someone had the guts to use it.
We'd met at a bar on Central Avenue, neutral territory. She'd been nervous, kept looking at the door like she expected it to burst open any second. I'd bought her a whiskey to steady her nerves. Then another. By the third drink, she was crying, telling me she'd changed her mind, she couldn't do it, they'd kill her, didn't I understand?
I understood. I'd seen what they did to people who talked. Harry Raymond was still in the hospital, learning to walk again after they wired a bomb to his starter. That was three weeks ago. The message was clear: the Combination didn't issue warnings twice.
Helen Marsh had looked at me with mascara running down her cheeks and said she was sorry, so sorry, but she had to think about her daughter, didn't I see? And then she'd walked out, and I'd sat there finishing my whiskey while six months of work circled the drain.
The client—a reform lawyer named Peterson who'd hired me to build a case against the councilman—had called this morning. Four a.m., which told me everything I needed to know about how the conversation would go. He'd heard about Helen. Word traveled fast when you were trying to take down the people who owned the telephone exchange.
"I'm sorry, Malone," he'd said. "Without her testimony, we've got nothing. I can't justify the expense anymore."
I'd told him I understood. I did understand. Understanding didn't pay the rent.
The hot plate took three tries to light. I made coffee strong enough to strip paint and drank it standing by the window, watching the city wake up below me. Bunker Hill spread out in a tumble of Victorian mansions gone to seed, their gingerbread trim rotting, their grand parlors carved into single rooms for men like me—men who'd run out of money and options and still somehow kept getting out of bed every morning.
The city was beautiful in the early light, the way a corpse is beautiful before it starts to rot. I'd been a cop for sixteen years before I quit. Walked away from a pension because I couldn't stomach one more cover-up. Now I was learning that the only thing worse than being complicit in corruption was being broke and alone trying to fight it.
Six months of cases gone wrong. Witnesses who recanted or disappeared. Clients who fired me or stopped returning calls. Evidence that vanished from locked safes. Every time I got close to something real, the ground shifted under my feet.
I'd started to wonder if I was losing my touch. Getting old, getting slow. The whiskey didn't help—I knew that—but the whiskey was the only thing that made the nights bearable, and the nights were long when you lived in a room with no telephone and no company and nothing but your own failures to keep you warm.
I finished the coffee and got dressed. The suit needed pressing, but the iron was broken and I couldn't afford to get it fixed. I settled for brushing the worst of the wrinkles out with my palm, a gesture that accomplished nothing but made me feel like I was trying.
The face in the mirror looked like a man who'd seen too much and understood too little. Forty years old in a couple of years, and what did I have to show for it? A scar through my eyebrow from a war that had solved nothing. A crooked nose from two different fights I'd won and lost simultaneously. Blue-gray eyes that had stopped expecting anything good a long time ago.
I dropped a dime on Mrs. Kowalski's threshold on my way out. She'd been coughing worse lately, and the drugstore on Third sold cough syrup she couldn't afford. I couldn't afford it either, but twelve dollars or eleven-ninety made the same difference when rent was six. The giving was automatic, the way breathing was automatic. You did it or you didn't, and if you didn't, you weren't the kind of person worth being.
I put on my hat, locked the door behind me, and walked down to Angels Flight.
The funicular cost a nickel I couldn't really spare, but the alternative was walking down three hundred steps, and my knees had started complaining about stairs sometime around my thirty-fifth birthday. The little orange car rattled down the hill, past the morning commuters heading the other direction, past the newsboys already shouting headlines about corruption and scandal and all the things that would never change no matter how many newspapers printed them.
A woman in a fur stole sat across from me, diamonds winking at her ears. Her smile was fixed when she nodded to the man beside her—society smile, practiced and empty as a pawnshop window. Money had bought her the coat but not whatever she was pretending to have underneath it. I could always see it, the gap between the surface and what rotted below. The man's hand on her arm possessive rather than protective. The bruise under her powder, faint but there if you knew how to look. The city taught you that, if you paid attention. Everything beautiful here was already dying; you just had to know where the decay had started.
My office was on the second floor of a building that had been respectable once, back when Bunker Hill was where the rich people lived. Now it housed a fortune teller, a bail bondsman, and me. The frosted glass on my door still said JACK MALONE / PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS, though the paint was starting to flake.
I was fishing for my keys when I noticed them—two men in expensive suits, standing outside my door like they'd been waiting. Not cops. The shoes were too good, and cops didn't wait.
They turned when they heard me coming, and something in their faces told me my luck was about to change.
I just didn't know yet whether it was changing for better or worse.
