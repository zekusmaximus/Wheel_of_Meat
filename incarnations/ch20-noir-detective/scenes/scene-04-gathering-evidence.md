The first sign was Doyle, the clerk from the assessor's office. He'd been my most reliable source—a man whose hands never stopped moving, but committed. He'd given me two depositions, each one more damning than the last. We had a third meeting scheduled for the second week of February, at a diner on Figueroa where the coffee was terrible and the booths were private.

He didn't show.

I waited an hour, smoking through half a pack of Lucky Strikes, before I gave up and went to his apartment. The landlady told me he'd moved out three days ago. Left in the middle of the night, she said. Didn't leave a forwarding address.

"Did he seem scared?" I asked.

She looked at me like I'd asked if the sun rose in the east. "Mister, everybody in this city is scared. What kind of question is that?"

I tried to find him. Checked the boarding houses, the missions, the bus stations. Doyle had vanished as thoroughly as if he'd never existed. The only trace he left was a gap in my evidence file where his depositions should have been—and when I checked the folder, I found the pages blank. Water damage, maybe, or some chemical process I didn't understand. The ink had simply... disappeared.

The second sign was Muñoz, the bartender from The Blue Parrot.

He didn't vanish. He recanted.

I found him behind the bar on a Tuesday afternoon, polishing glasses with a rag that had seen better years. When he saw me walk in, his face went pale.

"I can't talk to you."

"We talked before. You gave me a statement—"

"I was drunk." He wouldn't meet my eyes. "I made it up. All of it. I never saw any payoffs, never heard any names. I'm just a bartender, Malone. I pour drinks. That's all."

I leaned on the bar, close enough to smell the fear on him. Sour, chemical, the smell of a man who hadn't slept in days.

"What did they offer you? Money? Or just the promise that they wouldn't kill you?"

For a moment, something flickered in his eyes. Recognition. Anger. The remnant of the man who'd sat across from me in a back booth and told me about protection payments and police visits and the steady corruption that made his business possible.

Then it was gone.

"Get out of my bar, Malone. I don't know you. I never knew you."

The third sign was Helen Marsh.

She was dead.

I found out from the newspaper, not the police. A small story buried on page twelve: CITY EMPLOYEE DIES IN AUTO ACCIDENT. Helen Marsh, 34, formerly of the Chief of Police's office, had lost control of her car on Mulholland Drive and plunged two hundred feet into a canyon. The car had burned on impact. The body was badly damaged. The funeral would be private.

I read the story three times, looking for something I could use. There was nothing. Just another death in a city full of them.

But I remembered Helen Marsh. Remembered the way she'd looked when she gave me her statement, the mix of fear and relief, like a woman finally putting down a weight she'd been carrying for too long. She'd been brave. She'd wanted to do the right thing.

And now she was dead in a canyon, and the official story was "auto accident," and nobody would ever prove otherwise.

I kept working.

That was the thing about the case, about this city, about the whole rotten mess of it—there was always more work to do. Another witness to interview, another lead to follow, another thread to pull. The losses mounted up, but so did the evidence. I told myself it was a race, and all I had to do was stay ahead.

I photographed documents in courthouse basements when the clerks weren't looking. I bribed a printer at City Hall for copies of internal memos. I spent hours in the morgue at the Los Angeles Times, paging through back issues, connecting dates and names and numbers until the web of corruption was so dense I could barely see through it.

Vernon Shaw checked in weekly. He was pleased with the progress, his voice tightening when we discussed the losses. "We can replace witnesses," he said, though we both knew it wasn't true. "The important thing is the documentation. As long as we have the paper trail, we can make the case."

I didn't tell him about the blank pages in Doyle's file. About the photographs that had developed wrong, showing only shadows where there should have been faces. About the growing sense that something was working against me, something that operated on a level I couldn't understand.

Because if I told him that, I'd have to admit I was starting to believe it. And believing in things you couldn't see was the first step toward madness.

The weather broke at the end of the second week—a few days of sunshine that felt like a reprieve. I took the opportunity to drive out to Santa Monica, where one of the Combination's gambling ships, the S.S. Rex, sat anchored three miles offshore, just outside the legal limit.

The Rex was Tony Cornero's operation, the most successful of the floating casinos. Water taxis ferried passengers out from the pier, charging a quarter for the privilege of losing money in international waters. The city couldn't touch it. The state couldn't touch it. Federal agents occasionally made noise about shutting it down, but Cornero had lawyers, and the lawyers had lawyers, and nothing ever happened.

I wasn't trying to shut it down. I just wanted to see how the money moved.

I paid my quarter and rode out with a boatload of tourists and regulars, middle-aged men in suits and women in dresses that sparkled under the afternoon sun. The Rex loomed larger as we approached—a converted cargo ship with three decks of gambling halls, bars, restaurants. A floating city of vice, bobbing gently in the Pacific swell.

Inside, the noise was tremendous. Slot machines churning, dice rattling, the constant murmur of dealers calling numbers and announcing payouts. The carpet was red, the walls were gilt, and the smoke hung in the air thick enough to chew. I walked through the crowds, watching. Learning.

The money flowed like water. Cash to chips, chips to cash, winnings skimmed by the house at every transaction. I counted the staff—dealers, pit bosses, security men—and tried to calculate how much was moving through this room in a single afternoon. Thousands, at least. Maybe tens of thousands. And all of it funneling back to Los Angeles, to the Combination, to Mayor Shaw's pocket through channels so convoluted they might as well have been invisible.

This was what I was fighting. Not a man, not even an organization, but a current. Money flowing downhill, finding the path of least resistance, corrupting everything it touched. You couldn't stop a river by arresting one drop of water.

But you could build a dam. If you had enough evidence. If you had enough time. If you could keep the water from washing you away.

I stayed on the Rex for three hours, watching and taking mental notes. When I caught the water taxi back to shore, the sun was setting over the Pacific, painting the water gold and red, beautiful in the way this city was always beautiful—on the surface, and only on the surface.

The ride back to Bunker Hill took an hour in evening traffic. I parked my Buick—a three-year-old Roadmaster I'd bought cheap from a widow who didn't need it anymore—in the alley behind my boarding house and climbed the stairs to my room. The door was unlocked.

I drew my gun before I pushed it open.

The room had been tossed. Not ransacked—nothing was broken, nothing was destroyed—but every drawer had been opened, every pile of papers rifled through, every hiding place I thought I had discovered and examined. My spare suit lay crumpled on the bed. My case files were scattered across the floor. Even the coffee can on top of the icebox had been moved, though the money inside was untouched.

A message.

I stood in the doorway for a long moment, the Colt heavy in my hand, listening for sounds that might indicate whoever had done this was still here. The building creaked and settled. Water dripped somewhere in the walls. Nothing else.

I holstered the gun and walked inside.

They hadn't found anything, because there was nothing to find. The real evidence was in my office safe, not my room. But they knew I existed now. They knew I was looking. They knew where I lived.

The game had changed.

I poured myself a drink from the bottle I kept in my nightstand—the one they hadn't touched, either because they weren't interested or because they wanted me to know they could have—and sat on the edge of my bed, looking at the mess they'd made of my life.

Tomorrow, I would clean this up. Tomorrow, I would keep working. Tomorrow, I would interview more witnesses and gather more evidence and inch closer to a case that might or might not survive long enough to matter.

But tonight, I sat in my ransacked room and drank whiskey and wondered how much longer I had before they stopped sending messages and started sending bullets.

The rain started again sometime after midnight. I heard it on the roof, steady and relentless, the sound of Los Angeles trying to drown itself. The crack in my ceiling had spread another inch. Water would be through before spring.

I finished the drink, lay down on my unmade bed, and closed my eyes.

Someone had to give a damn.

Even when giving a damn might get you killed.
