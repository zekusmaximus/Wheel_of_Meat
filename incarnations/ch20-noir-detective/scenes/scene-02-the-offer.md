# Scene 2: The Offer

I hung my coat on the rack by the door and crossed to my desk, taking my time. The Venetian blinds were crooked—someone had touched them—and the filing cabinet drawer wasn't quite closed, a quarter inch of gap that hadn't been there yesterday. These men had been through my things. Not finding anything, because there was nothing to find, but looking.

"Sit down," I said, settling into my own chair. It squeaked, as it always did, a sound that had become so familiar I barely noticed it anymore. "And tell me why two men who could afford lawyers are slumming in a Bunker Hill detective agency."

The older one smiled, but not with his eyes. He took the chair across from me, folding one leg over the other with the ease of a man who'd never worried about creasing his trousers. The younger one remained standing by the window, the briefcase back in his hands.

"My name is Vernon Shaw." The older one let the name hang there, watching for a reaction. "And before you ask—no, not that Shaw. A distant relation, and not a proud one."

Mayor Frank Shaw. The Combination's pet politician, the man who'd turned Los Angeles into a vending machine where every service had its price and the machine was always broken. I kept my face blank.

"Go on."

"I'm part of a... concerned citizens' group." Vernon Shaw chose his words like a man picking through broken glass. "We believe the current city administration has exceeded the bounds of acceptable corruption. The Raymond bombing was the final straw. We're organizing a recall effort, Mr. Malone. Signatures are being gathered as we speak."

I'd heard the rumors. Half the reform-minded people in Los Angeles had heard them. A recall petition against a sitting mayor—the first in American history for a city this size. It sounded noble. It also sounded suicidal.

"You want to take down Frank Shaw," I said. "With petitions."

"With evidence." Vernon leaned forward, and for the first time I saw something behind the country club polish—his jaw tight, a vein pulsing at his temple. "The petition gets us on the ballot. But to win the recall, we need to show the public exactly what's been happening. The payoffs, the protection rackets, the Spy Squad operations. We need documentation that the newspapers can print and the voters can see."

"You need someone to do what Harry Raymond was doing. Before someone wired his car."

The younger man flinched. Vernon didn't.

"We're aware of the risks, Mr. Malone. That's why we're coming to you instead of one of the large agencies. You have a reputation for honesty. For not being buyable. For having left the LAPD rather than participate in cover-ups." He paused. "We did our research."

I thought about the twelve dollars in my coffee can. About the rent due in three days. About six months of failed cases and the slow grinding certainty that I was becoming irrelevant.

"You know what happened to Raymond," I said. "You know what happens to anyone who gets too close to the Combination. Why would I be any different?"

"Because you're already close." Vernon nodded at the filing cabinet with its gap-drawer, the blinds that had been touched. "Your name is on a list, Mr. Malone. The Spy Squad has been monitoring you since you left the force. Probably before. Captain Kynette considers ex-cops who didn't take the buyout to be potential whistleblowers. You're already in danger. The only question is whether you want to be in danger for nothing or for something."

I rubbed my jaw, feeling the stubble catch against my palm. It was a habit I'd picked up somewhere—couldn't remember when—this gesture of thinking, of buying time when time was the only thing I had to spend.

"What exactly do you want me to do?"

The younger man stepped forward and set the briefcase on my desk. He clicked it open. Inside: a manila folder, thick with papers, and underneath it, banded stacks of bills. More money than I'd seen in one place since I'd quit the force.

"Retainer," Vernon said. "Two hundred dollars. Twenty-five a day plus expenses after that, for as long as the investigation takes. The folder contains what we already have—names, dates, suspicious transactions. We need someone to verify, to add to it, to build the kind of case that can't be buried. Someone who knows how the police work, how the courts work, how the Combination protects itself."

I didn't touch the money. Not yet.

"Who else knows about this? Your 'concerned citizens' group?"

"A dozen people. Business owners, mostly. A few ministers. One or two sympathetic journalists. All of them have families, reputations, reasons not to be identified publicly until we're ready. If this fails, the Combination will destroy them."

"And if it fails, I'll be dead."

Vernon Shaw met my eyes. "Yes. Probably. Is that a reason not to try?"

Outside, I could hear the streetcar rattling past on Hill Street, the clang of its bell mixing with the rumble of automobiles and the distant sound of construction somewhere downtown. The city going about its business, buying and selling and making deals and pretending none of it was built on a foundation of blood and graft.

I thought about Harry Raymond, lying in a hospital bed, his lungs full of shrapnel.

I thought about the headline that morning: WITNESS RECANTS.

I thought about the twelve dollars in my coffee can, and the six months of failed cases, and the slow certainty that I was disappearing into irrelevance.

And underneath all of that, somewhere deeper than I could name, I thought about the simple fact that someone had to give a damn. Someone had to look at the rot and say it was rot, even if saying it got you killed. Someone had to try.

I didn't know where that thought came from—that compulsion to keep pushing against walls that wouldn't move. It felt older than me, older than this life, like an echo from somewhere I couldn't remember. But it was there, and it was strong, and it was the only thing that had ever felt like truth.

"You know what you're asking," I said. "You're asking me to paint a target on my chest and walk through a shooting gallery."

"We're asking you to help us take back our city."

"Same thing."

I looked at the money in the briefcase. At the folder full of names and dates and promises. At Vernon Shaw with his country club tan and his hard-set jaw, and the younger man who was probably someone's son or brother, standing there with white knuckles on the briefcase handle and sweat beading at his hairline.

I should have said no. Every instinct I'd developed in sixteen years as a cop and two years as a private detective was screaming that this was how men died—with good intentions and bad odds and a file full of evidence that would never see the light of day.

Instead, I reached into the briefcase and pulled out the folder.

"Tell me about these names."

Vernon Shaw exhaled—relief, or maybe just the release of tension he'd been holding since he walked in. The younger man's shoulders dropped an inch.

"The first section covers the payoff structure," Vernon began, leaning forward. "Shaw—Mayor Shaw—operates through intermediaries. His brother Joe handles most of the direct collections. Chief Davis provides the enforcement arm through the Spy Squad and the Gun Squad. The money flows up through a series of front businesses, mostly bars and gambling operations that are technically illegal but operate openly under police protection."

I opened the folder and started reading. Names I recognized, some of them. Aldermen and police captains and businessmen who showed up in the society pages with their wives at charity events. Numbers beside the names—payments, mostly, regular as clockwork. Five hundred here, a thousand there. Small amounts that added up to a fortune.

"This is circumstantial," I said. "Accounting records can be explained away. You need testimony."

"We have names." Vernon pointed to a page near the back. "People who've seen things, done things, want to talk. They're scared, obviously. The Raymond bombing made them more scared. But some of them are willing, if they can be assured of protection."

I looked at the list. A dozen names, with addresses and occupations. A city clerk. A police secretary. A bartender at one of the Combination's protected joints. Small people, caught in a big machine, hoping someone would help them get out.

"You want me to interview these people. Get their statements on record."

"Document everything. Build the case. When we have enough—when it's airtight—we go to the newspapers. Not the Times, they're in Shaw's pocket. But there are reform papers, out-of-town stringers who'd love to break this story. Once it's public, once the voters can see what's been happening, the recall becomes a matter of civic duty."

"And until then, I'm the only one connecting you to any of this."

"Yes."

I closed the folder. Looked at the money again. Two hundred dollars. More than three months' rent. More than I'd made in the last two months combined.

"The witness list," I said. "Some of these people are going to get cold feet once I start asking questions. Some of them are going to be compromised—Combination plants, or people who'll run to the cops the moment I leave. You understand that?"

"We understand."

"And when the Spy Squad figures out what I'm doing—and they will figure it out—they're going to come for me. They might come for your concerned citizens too. Are your ministers and businessmen ready for that?"

Vernon Shaw's jaw tightened. "We're prepared for casualties. We've all made peace with what this might cost."

It was the right answer, and it was probably a lie. Nobody was ever really prepared for casualties. Not until the casualties happened.

But he believed he meant it. That was something.

I picked up the folder and slid it into my desk drawer. Then I reached into the briefcase and took out the money—all of it, the banded stacks of twenties and tens and fives.

"I'll need a week to work through the initial list," I said. "Longer if people start disappearing or changing their stories. You'll hear from me when I have something concrete."

Vernon Shaw stood, extending his hand again. "Thank you, Mr. Malone. You won't regret this."

I shook his hand. The younger man gathered the empty briefcase and followed Vernon to the door.

"Mr. Shaw." They both turned. I was still sitting at my desk, the folder in the drawer, the money in my hand. "You should know why I'm taking this case."

"I assumed it was the money."

"The money helps." I set the bills down on the desk. "But the truth is, someone has to give a damn. Even if it doesn't matter. Even if it gets me killed. Someone has to look at the rot and call it rot. I quit the force because I couldn't stomach being part of the cover-up. This is the same thing. Just a different angle."

Vernon Shaw studied me for a long moment. Whatever he saw seemed to satisfy him.

"That's exactly what we were hoping to hear," he said. "Good luck, Mr. Malone."

They left. The frosted glass door swung shut behind them, and I was alone in my office with two hundred dollars and a list of names and the growing certainty that I'd just signed my own death warrant.

But somewhere beneath the certainty—beneath the fear and the pragmatic calculation—there was something else. Something that felt almost like relief. Six months of failed cases, and now I had a case that mattered. A case worth failing at.

I put the money in the safe, locked the drawer with the folder inside, and lit a cigarette.

Outside, the city kept moving. The Combination kept operating. The corruption kept flowing through Los Angeles like blood through a body too sick to heal.

But somewhere, a clock was ticking. And I was finally doing something worth dying for.
