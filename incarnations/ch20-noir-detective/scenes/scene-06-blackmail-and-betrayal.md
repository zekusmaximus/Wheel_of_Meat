Gloria Dane worked at a place called The Velvet Room, a nightclub on South Main that catered to businessmen who wanted discretion with their drinks. I went there that night, paid the cover charge, and found a table near the stage where a four-piece band was playing something slow and smoky.

She was easy to spot. Brennan had described her, and besides, she was the kind of woman who drew attention without trying—dark hair, full lips, a figure that the sequined dress she wore did nothing to hide. She moved between tables, smiling at customers, accepting drinks, playing the game that women in her position had to play to survive.

I watched her for an hour before approaching. Watched the men she talked to, the way she touched their arms and laughed at their jokes, the subtle transactions of attention and money that passed between them. She was good at her job. Professional in a way that suggested she'd been doing this long enough to know all the moves.

When she finally came to my table, her smile was automatic, part of the uniform.

"Buy a girl a drink?"

"I'll buy you information," I said. "If you have it."

The smile faltered. She looked at me more closely, and I saw something shift behind her eyes—calculation, wariness, the quick assessment of a woman who'd learned to size up danger.

"I'm not that kind of girl."

"I know exactly what kind of girl you are, Miss Dane." I kept my voice low, neutral. "I know about Howard Brennan. I know about the photographs. What I want to know is whether you're in on the blackmail or just caught in it."

The color drained from her face. She sat down without being invited, her composure cracking.

"How did you—"

"Brennan hired me to find the blackmailer. I'm not interested in ruining your life, Miss Dane. I just need to know who's behind this."

She looked around the club, checking for watchers. Her hands, I noticed, were clenched in her lap.

"I don't know who's doing it," she said finally. "I swear to God, I don't know. The photographs—I didn't even know they existed until someone sent me copies. They told me if I warned Brennan, they'd kill me. If I went to the police, they'd kill me. All I could do was sit here and wait and hope it would be over soon."

I believed her. The fear in her voice was too raw, too immediate to be faked.

"Do you have any enemies? Anyone who knew about you and Brennan, who might want to hurt one or both of you?"

She shook her head. "I was careful. I'm always careful. This shouldn't have happened."

"But it did." I took out my notebook, wrote down my office address and phone number, tore out the page. "If you think of anything—anyone who might have been watching you, any strange contacts, anything at all—call me. Day or night."

She took the paper with trembling fingers. "Are you going to find who did this?"

"I'm going to try."

"And if you don't?"

I didn't have an answer for that. Neither did she.

I spent the next two days tracking the blackmailer.

The demand letter led nowhere—generic typewriter, standard paper, postmarked from a mailbox outside the main post office. The photographs were harder. I found a darkroom tech who owed me a favor, and he examined the prints, looking for any identifying marks.

"Professional work," he said, holding the images up to the light. "Good paper, clean development. Whoever took these knew what they were doing. And see here?" He pointed to the edge of one photograph. "That's a Leica lens signature. High-end camera, not the kind you buy at a drugstore."

High-end equipment meant a professional photographer. Someone who'd been hired specifically to take these shots. I started working the list of professionals in the city, showing the photographs to anyone who might recognize the style.

On the second day, I found him.

His name was Jerry Novak, and he worked out of a studio on Sixth Street, taking publicity shots for actors and models who couldn't afford the big names. He was a small man, his fingers never still, with the pale skin of someone who spent too much time in darkrooms.

When I showed him the photographs, his face went white.

"Where did you get these?"

"Doesn't matter. What matters is that you took them."

He tried to lie, but he was bad at it. Within five minutes, I had the whole story. He'd been hired by a man he didn't know—"tall, dark hair, expensive suit, paid cash"—to set up surveillance in a specific hotel room and photograph anyone who came through. He'd delivered the negatives a week ago, collected his fee, and tried to forget the whole thing.

"The man who hired you," I said. "Would you recognize him if you saw him again?"

Novak shook his head. "He wore a hat, kept his face in shadow. I never got a good look. Just the voice—low, flat, no accent. Like he was trying not to have one."

"And the hotel room? Whose name was it under?"

Novak's eyes darted away. "I don't know. I just got the room number and the key. Didn't ask questions."

I left him with a warning not to leave town and a certainty that I was missing something. The man who'd hired Novak wasn't the blackmailer—he was too careful, too professional. He was a cutout, a layer of insulation between the real operator and the dirty work.

But why go to so much trouble to blackmail Howard Brennan? Ten thousand dollars was a lot of money, but not enough to justify this level of planning. There had to be something else. Something I wasn't seeing.

I found it the next morning.

I was in the Hall of Records, checking property transfers—still trying to rebuild the corruption case—when I came across Howard Brennan's name. He'd been buying land in the Valley, dozens of parcels over the past year, through a series of shell companies that all traced back to his development firm.

Land that, according to the surveys, was practically worthless. Flood plain, unstable soil, too far from the city to be commercially viable.

Unless you knew something the surveys didn't.

I dug deeper. Found a proposal buried in the city planning archives—a flood control project that would rechannelize the Los Angeles River, making the Valley land valuable. A project that had been quietly approved by the city council three months ago, that hadn't been announced to the public yet, that would make anyone who owned the right parcels very, very rich.

Howard Brennan had insider information. He was buying up land before the flood control announcement, planning to make a fortune on what was essentially legal corruption.

And someone was blackmailing him. Not for the affair—the affair was just leverage. They wanted something else.

I called Brennan's office. His secretary said he was in meetings all day. I called his home. His wife said he'd left early that morning and she didn't know where he was.

I called Gloria Dane at The Velvet Room. No answer.

By noon, I knew something was wrong. By two o'clock, I was certain.

By three, the police were at my door.

They found Jerry Novak dead in his studio. Shot twice, close range, with a .38-caliber revolver. The same caliber as the Colt Detective Special I carried in my shoulder holster.

The same Colt that had been taken from my safe when they ransacked my office. The same Colt that had been logged as missing in my report to the insurance company.

I sat in the interrogation room at Central Division, facing Detective Burke and his partner, and watched my life fall apart.

"Let me get this straight," Burke said, a smile spreading across his florid face. "You were investigating a blackmail case. The photographer who took the blackmail photos turns up dead, killed with your gun. And you expect us to believe you had nothing to do with it?"

"Someone stole my gun. You know that. I filed a report."

"A convenient report." Burke leaned forward. "Here's what I think happened, Malone. You found the photographer, you squeezed him for information, and when he couldn't give you what you wanted, you killed him. Or maybe you killed him because he knew too much. Either way, you're looking at a murder charge."

"I didn't kill anyone."

"Then who did?"

I didn't have an answer. The frame was too neat, too perfect. Someone had used my gun to kill Novak, knowing I would be connected to the case, knowing the police would come for me. The same someone who'd been sabotaging the corruption case. The same someone who seemed to know my every move before I made it.

They held me overnight. In the morning, a lawyer I'd never seen before showed up and got me released on my own recognizance—Vernon Shaw's doing, I assumed, though the lawyer wouldn't confirm it. The evidence was circumstantial; I had no motive for killing Novak; and Burke, for all his bluster, knew he didn't have enough for a conviction.

But the damage was done. My name was in the papers now, connected to a murder. The witnesses I'd been trying to re-interview would never talk to me again. The corruption case was effectively dead.

I walked out of the police station into gray February light and tried to think of what came next.

Howard Brennan had disappeared. Gloria Dane had disappeared. Jerry Novak was dead. And I was walking around with a murder charge hanging over my head like a sword on a fraying thread.

Someone was playing a game I didn't understand. Someone who had more power than the Combination, more reach than the police, more patience than any enemy I'd ever faced.

I walked home through streets that felt suddenly foreign, past faces that might have been watching me, under a sky that promised more rain. The pieces of the case lay scattered around me like fragments of a shattered mirror, each one reflecting a different angle of the same truth:

I was losing.

But I wasn't going to stop.

Someone had to give a damn. Even when giving a damn got people killed.

Even when you were the one who was going to die.
