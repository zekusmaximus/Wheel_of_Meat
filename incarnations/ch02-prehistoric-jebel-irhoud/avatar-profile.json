    "name_meaning": "Possibly 'self' or 'spirit'—primal, single-syllable",
    "period": "Approximately 300,000 BCE",
    "location": "Jebel Irhoud region, Morocco",
    "role": "Hunter, initially solitary",
    "tribe_status": "Outsider by choice—sleeps alone near cave mouth, maintains distance from tribe pile"

  "physical": {
    "description": "Strong hunter's body, capable of solo kills",

  "psychology": {
    "core_belief_opening": "Alone is strong. Together is weak. Ka thinks burning makes strong. Ka thinks alone safe.",
    "core_flaw_manifestation": "Proto-form of compulsive helper—the instinct is suppressed/undeveloped. Ka's arc moves TOWARD helping, not struggling with attachment to helping.",
    "fatal_flaw": "Hoarding—when given the choice between sharing and keeping, Ka reverts to isolation. Dies alone with hoarded meat.",
    "the_ice_wall": "Something in Ka's chest. Like ice wall. Like stone where heart should be. Heavy. Dead.",
    
    "strengths": [
      "Patience and observation ('Ka watches. Learns.')",
      "Physical hunting capability",
      "Ability to learn from watching others",
      "Capacity for warmth when ice wall cracks"

    "recognition_marker_behavioral": "The watching-to-understand quality—'Must learn their ways. Must understand new thing.' Persists into Silas's academic temperament."

  "relationships": {
    "tribe": {
      "status": "Outsider by choice, then briefly integrated, then self-exiled",
      "dynamic": "Ka sleeps alone, maintains distance, but tribe saves Ka from cat"
    },
    "alpha_male": {
      "history": "Past conflict—Ka remembers spear wound in side from fighting time, alpha male's teeth showing, others turning away",
      "arc": "From antagonist to unexpected source of acceptance (gives Ka new spear, respect-move at feast)"
    },
    "young_hunters": {
      "dynamic": "Offer Ka food, make come-here movements, show fresh kill—rejected by Ka until tribe hunt"

  "chapter_arc": {
    "opening_state": {
      "external": "Ka sleeps alone near cave mouth while tribe sleeps in pile. Hunts alone. Strong but isolated.",

    "catalyst": "Observes pack hunters (dogs) killing with terrifying efficiency through cooperation",

      "Ka watches pack hunters, feels small and weak",

    "regression": [
      "Cold time comes, prey scarce",
      "Ka begins hoarding meat",
      "Sleeps near meat pile, guards it",

      "Alpha male discovers hidden meat",
      "Ka takes meat and walks into storm alone"
    ],
    "climax": "Ka dies alone in cold, hoarded meat frozen solid",
    "closing_state": {
      "external": "Body dying in snow, meat useless",
      "internal": "Finally understands giving—'Burning need to know giving'—but too late for this flesh"
    }
  },
  
  "lesson_development": {
    "perfection": "Loving-kindness (mettā) / Cooperation and social bonds",
    "what_learned": "That together is stronger than alone. That tribe-warmth exists and feels good. That cooperation enables survival.",
    "what_failed": "HOW to give—not just resources but self. Ka's final hoarding shows the lesson is intellectual desire, not embodied practice. The 'burning need to know giving' is hunger, not actualization.",
    "death_insight": "Finally learning give-way, too late for this flesh, but time stretches ahead... Ka's hunger to learn giving pushes through dark... Finds new place to grow, new flesh to learn through.",
    "seeds_next_life": "Ka dies with hunger to understand giving. Chandra (Ch 3) will have resources to give but will give resources, not self. The incomplete lesson evolves but remains incomplete."
  },
  
  "death": {
    "circumstances": "Self-exile into winter storm after refusing to share hoarded meat. Dies of cold, alone.",
    "final_moments": "Ka's secret meat now hard as rock. Like Ka's black fingers... Through cave-mouth, Ka sees smoke rise from tribe-cave below. Not one fire—many small fires join, make big warm.",
    "thematic_resonance": "The meat Ka hoarded becomes useless (frozen). The isolation Ka chose becomes death. Everything Ka learns comes too late for this body.",
    "transcendence": "Death takes Ka's meat but cannot take Ka's new hunger. Cannot take growing flame. Ka's next spirit burns toward new life like night-flutter flies to fire. Ready to learn. Ready to give."

  "symbolic_elements": {
    "ice_wall_chest_stone": {
      "meaning": "Ka's isolation manifested physically",
      "arc": "Appears → cracks when tribe saves Ka → melts during feast → returns when hoarding → final cold in death"
    },

      "meaning": "Together-strength that Ka must learn but initially fears",
      "description": "Move like one big animal. Not wolf. Not bear. Not cat. Something new."

      "meaning": "Consequence of isolation—Ka alone is prey, not predator",
      "function": "Crisis that forces Ka to accept tribe help"

    }
  },
  
  "notes": "This is the soul's earliest incarnation shown in the novel. The helper-instinct that becomes Silas's defining trait is here in embryonic form—not yet developed, not yet a fetter. Ka learns TO help (cooperation) but not HOW to give (true generosity). The regression/hoarding sequence shows that learning isn't linear—Ka achieves warmth and then loses it. This pattern of progress-then-regression may echo across incarnations."
