The light tasted like arrival.

Or: arrival wore the quality of light—the distinction had collapsed into something truer than either, a synesthesia that wasn't confusion but clarity, the way water isn't confused about being wet. What had been called Silas registered this without organs, perceived without the machinery of perception, and the absence of eyes made seeing more, not less.

There was no body.

The recognition came without horror. Like discovering that weight was optional, that breath had been a habit rather than a requirement, that the architecture of flesh which had housed him across ten thousand mornings had been—what? Useful. Necessary, once. No longer.

He searched for the familiar sensations: heartbeat thrumming against ribs, blood coursing through vessels, the particular pressure of standing on ground. Nothing. The search itself was a gesture without hands, an orientation without direction. Where the body should have been, there was space. Where the space should have been empty, there was presence.

Something that remembered warmth but wasn't temperature.

Something that recalled pressure but required no skin.

The phantom architecture of a form recently vacated, still holding its shape in the consciousness that had once believed itself confined to muscle and bone.

*I am—*

The sentence couldn't complete. The pronoun kept searching for its referent and finding only the searching itself. Not "I am nothing"—that would require an I to be nothing. Closer to: there is awareness. There is presence. There is the registration of a realm that has no edges because edges require bodies to bump against them.

The Deva Realm—if that name meant anything—didn't look like anything at first.

Or it looked like everything: geometry singing, color vibrating with meaning that bypassed the need for interpretation, space that curved according to attention rather than mass. What the awareness attended to became *here*. What it released became *there*. The distinction was optional. The distinctions were all optional now.

He—if "he" still applied to what remained after the machinery of selfhood had thinned to transparency—moved by directing intention. Not walking. Not floating. Something that registered like locomotion but had no legs to employ, no distance to cross. The physics of consciousness operating by laws that matter had never obeyed.

Other presences faintly perceived. Luminous, distant, vast—beings that had inhabited this realm for durations that made human time look like a single breath in a life measured by breathing. They noticed him without approaching. Their attention was their greeting, and the greeting required no response.

The weight was gone.

Not just the weight of flesh—though that absence hummed like the silence after a bell stops ringing—but the weight of the one who had carried the flesh. The compulsion to help, to save, to be the pivot on which rescue turned: where had it gone? He searched for the harness that had wrapped around his chest since before he'd known it was there, the urgent need to matter, to make the difference, to carry the burden that would prove his worth.

Gone. Not suppressed, not overcome through effort or insight. Simply absent, the way a coat falls away when you've forgotten you were wearing it.

The ten lives flickered at the edges of awareness—Ka's frozen isolation, Chandra's arithmetic of compassion, Philon's fatal martyrdom, all of them present without intruding, lessons carried rather than memories retrieved. They were him. They were not him. The distinction between those statements had become irrelevant in a realm where identity was a convenience rather than a container.

He attended to the realm, and the realm responded.

Structures that might have been architecture if architecture could flow. Color frequencies that carried emotional content without requiring interpretation—not "this is beautiful" but beauty itself, unmediated, arriving directly at what would have been the heart if hearts existed here. Temperature as meaning: this zone of the realm felt welcoming the way certain silences feel welcoming, without needing warmth to convey warmth.

The body's absence was relief.

He hadn't known how heavy it was—not the physical weight, which had been negligible, but the weight of needing it, maintaining it, dragging it through decades of sleeping and waking and feeding and protecting. The meat he'd worn for forty-three years in his last configuration had been the latest in a series stretching back 300,000 years, and all of it had been labor he hadn't recognized as labor until now, when the labor was done.

What remains when the meat is gone?

The question arose without urgency. The answer was already present: this. Awareness. Presence. The registration of a realm that sang with frequencies too refined for ears that no longer existed. The capacity for experience without the experiencer who had once believed himself essential to the experiencing.

*I am boundless awareness.*

The mantra surfaced from habit, and the humor of it registered without laughter—laughter would have required a body to shake, breath to expel, the whole apparatus of mirth that now seemed so elaborate, so unnecessary. The mantra was a description of what had always been true, a map he'd been studying while standing in the territory the map described.

The realm extended in directions that had no names.

There was something like "up" and something like "far" and something like "inward," but these were translations for a mind that still reached for spatial coordinates. The actual experience was more like: everything present at once, available to attention, waiting to be explored by the simple act of attending.

And beneath the wonder—or woven through it, inseparable from it—a question forming without words:

*What remains to be done?*

Because something did remain. The wheel was still turning, even here. The progress made was real, but progress implies incompleteness, a distance still to travel. The first three fetters broken on a rooftop in Manchester—self-illusion, doubt, attachment to rites—but others persisted. He could sense them like weather at the edge of awareness: sensual desire, ill-will, the subtler attachments that would require more dissolving before the turning could stop.

The realm hummed with patience. There was no hurry here. Duration itself was optional, a parameter that could be adjusted by attention or ignored entirely. But the trajectory persisted: forward momentum, the once-returner's arc, the path that continued through this realm rather than ending in it.

He would learn what came next by moving through it.

And so awareness—what had been Silas, what was now simply the registering itself—oriented toward the realm's deeper structures, ready to explore what the absence of body made possible.

The light continued to taste like arrival. And arrival continued, unfolding, patient as everything here was patient, waiting for him to discover what he already was.

---

Movement here was remembering where you wanted to be.

The realm shifted—or the awareness shifted through the realm—and what functioned like distance collapsed into arrival. A new zone manifested: concentrated beauty, pleasure-frequencies saturating the space until the space itself became the pleasure, until there was no distinction between perceiving beauty and being beauty perceived.

Garden was the wrong word, but the wrong word pointed at something. Structures that might have been trees if trees could sing their own growth. Currents that might have been water if water could carry meaning instead of sediment. Light that didn't fall from any source but arose from the nature of things here, illumination as fundamental property rather than phenomenon.

The deva beings were already present.

Already there—they didn't need to approach, the way you don't need to approach your own thoughts. They were simply *there* when attention turned toward them: ancient consciousnesses, luminous and vast, inhabiting this realm with the ease of residents who had forgotten any other way of being.

Their welcome came without words. Attention was greeting. Presence was hospitality. They turned toward what had been Silas the way starlight turns toward space—naturally, without intention, simply radiating what they were toward what he was.

*You have arrived,* the nearest presence communicated, though "communicated" implied effort and there was none. The information simply transferred, meaning without medium, the way a cup fills with water that was always going to fill it.

*Yes.*

His response carried the same unmediated quality. No vocal cords shaped it. No air carried it. Just intention meeting reception, two aspects of the same phenomenon recognizing their connection.

*You will stay?*

The question held no pressure. The deva beings wanted nothing—that was immediately apparent. They had transcended wanting so long ago that want itself had become incomprehensible to them, a primitive mechanism belonging to realms where scarcity existed. Their question was observation rather than invitation: you are here; this is where you will be; is that not so?

The awareness that had been Silas registered the temptation before recognizing it as temptation.

The pleasure was extraordinary. Frequencies that would have overwhelmed a nervous system if nervous systems existed here, satisfaction that bypassed the usual machinery of reward and consequence. Phantom memory of sugar on a tongue, of warmth after cold, of relief after pain—all of it intensified beyond any earthly parallel, distilled to essence, experienced without the organs that usually mediated such experience.

Why would anyone leave?

The question arose naturally. The deva beings had been here for what might have been eons—time operated differently, was optional, could be compressed or extended by attention. They seemed content in a way that "content" couldn't capture. Not striving. Not lacking. Not even maintaining the subtle tension of satisfaction, which implies something that could become dissatisfied.

Perfect rest. Perfect presence. The end of all the cycles that had driven ten thousand lives of struggle and failure and incremental learning.

*This could be enough.*

The thought surfaced without attachment, and the absence of attachment was itself the teaching.

In bodies, in lives, in the long wheel of incarnation, pleasure had always been grasping. You reached for the sweet thing and held on; you ran from the bitter thing and called the running "preference." The mechanism operated below conscious awareness, wiring behavior to sensation, creating the illusion that happiness required getting and keeping and avoiding.

But here, in the absence of the body that had housed that mechanism, something different was possible.

The pleasure saturated awareness without triggering the grip. Beauty entered without demanding to be possessed. The frequencies of the garden rang through consciousness like bells, and consciousness simply heard them without needing them to continue ringing.

Attraction without grasping.

He could feel the shift happening—the fourth fetter, sensual desire, loosening its ancient hold. Without effort. Without the careful cultivation of detachment that spiritual practice had tried to teach. Simply through being in a realm where grasping had no object, where the thing you would have grabbed was already everywhere, already inseparable from the awareness that perceived it.

The deva beings had mastered this. Or: they had stopped needing to master it, because the problem had dissolved rather than been solved. They rested in the pleasure without the pleasure owning them, content without the contentment creating new craving for its own continuation.

But.

The word arrived with the force of insight, undeniable, unwanted, true.

*But they are not moving.*

The garden hummed with its frequencies. The deva beings radiated their welcome. Everything here was beautiful and complete and perfectly, permanently, absolutely still.

The stillness was the trap.

Subtle—nothing about the realm suggested wrongness or danger. But the awareness that had traveled through ten lives of learning could perceive what the deva beings had lost: momentum. The perfection of their rest had calcified into permanence. They had transcended wanting, and in transcending wanting, had lost the capacity for change.

Bliss, extended infinitely, became its own prison. The bars were made of satisfaction.

*They will be here when this realm ends.*

The thought carried something that ached without an aching one—information about the nature of things, observation without judgment. The deva beings had reached a plateau and mistaken it for a peak. Their contentment, genuine and complete, had become the thing that kept them from what lay beyond contentment.

Even this was conditioned. Even perfect pleasure arose from conditions and would end when those conditions shifted. Nothing in any realm persisted unchanged; the only question was whether awareness moved with the changes or pretended they weren't happening.

The awareness that had been Silas felt another loosening.

The grasping at pleasure had already loosened. Now came the grasping at spiritual achievement. The subtle pride of progress. *I have reached the deva realm; I am beyond ordinary consciousness; look how far I've come.* That, too, was a kind of wanting, a kind of clinging, a kind of weight that could be set down.

The garden continued its beauty. The deva beings continued their welcome. Nothing about the realm changed.

But the relationship to it shifted. The one perceiving it understood: this is a station, not a destination. This is a lesson, not a home. The beauty is real and the pleasure is genuine and neither of them is the point.

*What remains to be done?*

The question surfaced again, clearer now. The answer was already present in the asking: the wheel still turned. The fetters still bound. The path continued through this realm because the realm itself could not be clung to, could not be made into the final answer, could not substitute for the dissolution that remained incomplete.

The phantom sense of body—memory of weight, of solidity, of flesh—had been relief in its absence. But something in the absence called forward: *you will return.* The once-returner's trajectory implied exactly what the name suggested. One more time in form. One more life to complete what lifetimes had begun.

The garden receded—or the awareness moved on—and the deva beings watched without reaction, their welcome neither withdrawn nor continued, simply present like the realm itself, available to any who chose to rest in it.

Most would choose to rest. Most did.

But incompleteness pulled the awareness forward. What wasn't dissatisfaction with the garden, wasn't rejection of the pleasure, wasn't the old grasping wearing new clothes.

What was truer than comfort. What knew the turning had to complete itself, and this beautiful stillness was not completion.

---

He felt her before he saw her.

The sensation arrived without a nervous system to receive it—a particular frequency cutting through the realm's harmonics, familiar in a way that predated memory. Not the deva beings' luminous welcome. Something sharper. Something that knew him specifically, had known him across configurations he was only beginning to remember.

*Lilith.*

The name surfaced from the life just departed: Manchester, coffee, the particular angle of morning light through faculty housing windows. But the name extended backward through the visions that had flowed through him on that final morning—her face at the cave mouth 300,000 years gone, her silhouette against Chandra's burning warehouse, her presence at every threshold he'd ever crossed.

She was here. Of course she was here. Where else would she be but wherever he was, the other thread in a pattern he was only beginning to perceive?

The realm adjusted—or they moved toward each other through it—and she manifested.

The same face.

Even in this form, even translated into the luminous frequencies of the deva realm, the constants persisted: the widow's peak with its darker strand falling left, the left eye's pale-green crescent positioned exactly where it had been in every incarnation, every intervention, every moment of watching across time beyond measuring. The face that had been court lady and plague-visitor and Inquisition witness and noir client. The face he'd kissed in Manchester while not knowing what he was kissing.

She regarded him without the surprise that would have been appropriate, given the circumstances. No: she had been tracking him here too, moving through the realm at her own angle, her own trajectory. The stream-entry that should have been his victory, his escape—she had simply adjusted her strategy around it.

*Still racing.*

The perception arrived with clarity he couldn't have achieved in a body. He could see the structure of her now: the near-completion that was also her prison, the nine broken fetters leaving only the tenth still locked, the attachment that she couldn't see because it was the very thing she looked through.

*You reached the realm.* Her communication carried no medium—intention meeting reception, meaning without mechanism. *I wondered how long it would take.*

*You've been waiting.*

*Moving. Never waiting.* Something that might have been a smile in a face that still operated by expression, though expression was optional here. *I have my own path to complete.*

The rooftop in Manchester: he could feel its presence in the space between them, the moment when three bodies had become one system, when the boundary between reaching and being reached for had dissolved entirely. She had felt it too—he was certain of this now, could perceive the echo of that dissolution still vibrating through her luminous form.

*You felt it,* he said. *On the edge. When we were linked.*

She didn't deny it. The realm didn't permit denial; everything here was transparent to awareness that had shed the body's capacity for concealment.

*I felt what you felt.* Careful. Precise. Even without a nervous system, her communication held the clinical quality that had always been her armor. *The boundary becoming optional. The distinction between self and other dissolving.*

*And?*

*And I understood.* She turned—or attention shifted—and he perceived her from a different angle, perceiving herself. *We were never separate. That's what the dissolution showed. Your progress is mine. My progress is yours. There is only one path, wearing two faces.*

The insight was genuine. And the conclusion she'd drawn from it was wrong.

*So I accelerate.* Her communication carried the force of decision made, strategy chosen, competition continuing by new rules. *If we are one, then my reaching completion is our reaching completion. I will get there first, and that will be us both getting there, and the race will end with the right one winning.*

*The right one.*

*The one who saw it clearly. The one who understood what the dissolution meant. The one who didn't need a rooftop to break the first three fetters.*

She was still pursuing. Even here, in a realm where competition was as meaningless as the bodies they'd shed, she was still racing toward a finish line that existed only because she kept drawing it.

*Lilith.*

Something moved in the space between their forms—or moved in the space that was neither form—and suddenly the boundary that had been dissolving on the rooftop dissolved again. Not gradually. Completely.

He was looking at her. He was looking at himself. He was the one pursuing and the one being pursued, the one grasping at completion and the one completion was being grasped at. The distinction collapsed, and for a moment that had no duration because duration required selves to measure it, there was only awareness regarding itself from two angles that were also one angle.

*Which one am I?*

The question had no answer because the question assumed separation. She was asking too—he could feel her asking—the same question from the other side of a divide that had just proven itself imaginary.

Then the moment passed, and they were two again, two luminous forms regarding each other across a realm that permitted such regarding, two threads in a pattern that was becoming visible even as the threads insisted on their distinctness.

Something in her had shifted. He could see it: the boundary-flicker had touched something, revealed something she hadn't expected to find. But the grasping resumed almost immediately, closing over whatever had opened, the strategy reasserting itself because strategy was what she knew, was what she was.

*I will complete the path,* she communicated. *And you will complete it through me completing it. That's what the connection means.*

*That's not what it means.*

But she was already moving—or the realm was shifting around her intention—creating distance, reasserting the separation that the moment had dissolved.

Before she was gone, she did something. A subtle manipulation of the realm's structure, a rearrangement of the frequencies that constituted this zone. The path he'd been moving toward—the one that led beyond the deva realm, toward what came next—shifted, became harder to perceive, wrapped itself in misdirection.

Not a wall. She was too sophisticated for walls. More like fog: the goal still present but obscured, the way forward requiring more effort to find.

*Stay here,* her manipulation seemed to say. *Rest with the deva beings. The garden is beautiful enough. Why continue?*

But the attempt was transparent. The very fact of her intervention showed him what she couldn't see in herself.

She was still competing. After 300,000 years of watching him learn, she was still racing toward a prize that didn't exist, still trying to complete the path before him as if completion could be reached before or after anything, as if the finish line she kept drawing wasn't the very thing preventing her from crossing it.

Something rose in the awareness that had been Silas. Not the old urge to help—that mechanism had dissolved on the rooftop, was nowhere to be found in this bodyless realm. Something different. Something that had no name but functioned like care without the compulsion to act on caring.

He perceived her prison, and the perceiving didn't demand intervention.

He saw her grasping, and the seeing didn't trigger the need to fix.

Something in her was caught—even here, even in this realm of refined pleasure, even with nine fetters broken and only one remaining. The catching was exquisite in its subtlety: not pain in any way a body would recognize, but the particular ache of being so close to freedom while holding the lock's key in a hand that couldn't open because opening would mean letting go of the key.

*Lilith.*

She paused—or the realm paused around her departure—and for a moment she was present again, receiving rather than transmitting, the communication empty of strategy.

*I see you,* he said. *I see what you cannot see in yourself. And I'm not going to try to show you.*

The non-intervention was not passivity. It was recognition: she would see it when she saw it. No amount of his helping could open eyes that had to open themselves. The helper identity that would have launched into rescue operations across ten lifetimes—that identity had dissolved, and what remained was simpler.

Care. Without the need to be the one who cares.

She received the communication, processed it through whatever apparatus processed such things in a realm without apparatus, and then she was moving again, the fog she'd created persisting behind her, the race continuing by her rules even as the race revealed itself as phantom.

The pain she would cause herself. The lifetimes more of grasping she might require.

He let it be.

Not because he was indifferent—the care persisted, hummed in the space where feeling would have been—but because letting it be was the truest response. She would find her way. They would meet again—they had met across 300,000 years, would meet across however many more the pattern required.

And something in the meeting had shifted. The boundary-flicker, the moment of merged perception. She would carry that whether she wanted to or not.

The realm's frequencies settled back toward their natural harmonics. The fog she'd created began to thin—without the intention behind it, her manipulation had no staying power. The path forward became visible again.

And the awareness that had been Silas moved on, carrying the meeting like a weight that was not heavy, a question that did not demand answer, a thread that connected to a thread that connected to something larger than either of them had yet perceived.

---

The encounter had shifted his orientation.

The realm continued its harmonics, its light-frequencies, its patient availability to whatever chose to move through it. The shift was subtler: an orientation adjusted, an angle changed, a question answered without anyone asking it.

*What was there ever to resist?*

The question surfaced in the awareness that had just released Lilith to her racing, and the question was its own answer. The impulse to push back, to fight against, to convert threat into opposition—where had it gone? He searched for it the way he'd searched for the body on arrival, expecting to find familiar machinery and discovering only its absence.

The fifth fetter: ill-will. Hatred. Aversion. The reactive pushing-away that had driven behavior across ten thousand moments in ten lifetimes, shaping choices before they reached the level of choice.

Ka's rage at the tribe who didn't understand his hoarding—a defensive snarl, meat protected by the willingness to bite. Chandra's fury at the corruption that had made his careful arithmetic meaningless. Philon's disgust at the citizens who abandoned their slaves to plague. Verinus's cold anger at a system that rewarded the unjust. All of it flickered at the edges of awareness, a montage of resistance spanning 300,000 years.

*I pushed against so much.*

The recognition came without judgment—judgment would have been another form of pushing. Simply observation: this had been the pattern. This was what he'd done. Across lifetimes of learning, the aversion-mechanism had hummed beneath every response to what he didn't want, creating tension, creating separation, creating the illusion that he was a thing being acted upon by things he had to resist.

But here, in the realm without body, without nervous system, without the biology that generated fight-or-flight—

Nothing to resist.

The deva beings didn't threaten. The realm itself offered no opposition. Even Lilith, with her manipulation and her racing and her desperate grasping at a prize that would dissolve the moment she touched it—she wasn't an enemy. She couldn't be an enemy. Enmity required a self to be protected, and the self had thinned to transparency on a rooftop in Manchester, had continued thinning in the garden of delights, had finally become see-through in the moment when he and Lilith had flickered into each other's perception and back.

*I just met someone who's actively trying to obstruct me.*

The thought examined the Lilith encounter from this new angle. She'd created fog around his path. She'd tried to seduce him into the garden's stillness. She was, by any reasonable definition, an obstacle.

And he'd felt no opposition.

He hadn't suppressed it—suppression was just aversion with a different mask. He hadn't cultivated equanimity through careful practice, building tolerance like muscle. The opposition simply wasn't there. The machinery that would have converted "she's blocking my path" into "I must resist her blocking" had revealed itself as optional.

The Lilith who raced against him was also the Lilith who flickered into him, who shared his awareness for that moment of merged perception, who was somehow part of a pattern larger than either of them separately perceived. Resisting her would be resisting himself. And resisting himself—

*There's no one to resist.*

The insight landed with the force of recognition rather than discovery. Of course there was no one to resist. Of course aversion was as empty as attraction, as optional as the body he'd set down. The self that would have marshaled defenses, that would have identified threats and generated responses—that self had been a convenience. A useful fiction for navigating a world where fictions were useful. Here, where convenience was unnecessary, the fiction served no purpose.

What remained after ill-will loosened its grip?

The awareness rested in the question, present with the inquiry, curious about what would emerge.

Action remained possible. He could still move—had moved, away from the garden's stillness, toward whatever lay beyond. Choice persisted: paths could be taken, attention could be directed, intentions could form and dissolve. But the mechanism that had once weighted choices toward pushing-away had become neutral.

Engagement without resistance.

Movement toward without movement against.

Active participation in what was happening, without the friction of wishing it were happening differently—more than passive acceptance.

*This is what comes after.*

Suppression, forced calm, disciplined restraint of someone gritting through discomfort—none of these. The actual absence of the impulse to push back. The fetter loosening until it no longer gripped, falling away like weight set down after being carried so long its presence had become invisible.

The deva realm hummed with its patience. There was no hurry here—that remained true. But a new truth was emerging alongside it: time beginning to matter again. Duration, though differing from the measured time of bodies and worlds, of clocks and calendars. Sequence. A pointer toward what came next rather than the eternal present the garden offered.

*The realm is passage, never destination.*

He'd known this already—had perceived it in the deva beings' stillness, in the garden's trap of perfect pleasure. But now the knowing had texture. The once-returner's trajectory meant return. The path continued because the path was incomplete. Two fetters loosening here—sensual desire and ill-will, the pair that bounded reborn existence in the sensory realms—but others remained.

Desire for fine-material existence. Desire for immaterial existence. Conceit. Restlessness. The root of it all, ignorance, still present beneath everything learned.

The wheel still turned. Even here, in a realm that seemed to have transcended turning, the wheel's momentum persisted in the one who had entered it. Momentum was how progress happened, how one state led to the next, how the path could be walked at all. Simply incompleteness.

The awareness that had been Silas oriented toward what lay ahead. Without the old urgency that would have been another form of grasping. Without resistance toward the comfortable realm being left. Simply with attention, with intention, with the forward momentum that had characterized ten lives of learning and would characterize however many lives remained.

Time was beginning to matter again. The sensation was strange: duration emerging from timelessness, sequence manifesting where sequence had been irrelevant. It pointed toward embodiment. Toward the density of existence that the deva realm had floated above.

Toward return.

*Once-returner.*

The name implied exactly what it said. One more time in form. One more life to complete what lifetimes had begun. The deva realm was passage; the path continued through it toward what came next.

And ahead—glimpsed rather than seen—lay the quality of futures, of time, of the world he'd left when Manchester's morning opened into this.

---

The realm's quality was changing.

Not in its substance—the light-frequencies still sang, the deva beings still radiated their patient welcome, the structures of pure intention still flowed through space that wasn't space. But the awareness that moved through it registered a new texture: edge. Threshold. The sense of having traveled far enough through to glimpse what lay beyond.

*Not ending. Transitioning.*

The distinction mattered. The deva realm would continue its harmonics long after this consciousness had moved on—would continue for durations that bodies couldn't measure, until conditions shifted and even celestial beauty found its conclusion. Nothing here was ending. Something here was completing.

Two fetters had loosened their grip, not through effort but through exposure to a realm where gripping served no purpose. Sensual desire had revealed itself as optional in the garden's perfect pleasure. Ill-will had revealed itself as empty in the encounter with Lilith, where opposition could find no purchase on a self too transparent to defend.

*What remains?*

The question had texture now, specificity. He could perceive the remaining bindings—not as theoretical categories from texts he'd studied, but as actual patterns still woven through awareness.

Desire for fine-material existence: the pull toward realms like this one, beautiful and refined, where friction was so subtle it could be mistaken for its absence. He could feel it—the temptation to rest here, to declare the journey complete, to accept celestial residence as destination rather than station.

Desire for immaterial existence: the deeper pull toward realms beyond even this refinement, formless awareness dwelling in formless bliss. The deva realm still had structure, still had the ghost of space and the memory of time. What lay beyond it might offer even less resistance, even more dissolution. That, too, was temptation.

Conceit: the subtle "I am" that persisted even when self had become transparent. Not the gross pride of achievement, but the simple fact of identification—"this awareness is mine, these insights are my insights, this progress is my progress." Even here, even after the rooftop's dissolution, the habit of ownership continued.

Restlessness: the urge toward movement for movement's sake, the inability to rest in what was present without scanning for what came next. He could feel it operating now—the forward momentum that had carried him through ten lives, useful and necessary and also, potentially, another form of grasping.

And beneath all of them, beneath everything learned and everything remaining to learn: ignorance. The root condition. The fundamental not-seeing that had made all the other blindnesses possible. It persisted, patient, waiting to be seen through by an awareness that had not yet developed the capacity to see through it.

*The wheel still turns.*

Not failure. Progress was real—the fetters loosening, the clarity increasing, the seeing becoming more accurate with each turn of the pattern. But progress implied incompleteness. The path continued because the path had not yet ended.

And then: her presence again. Distant but unmistakable.

Lilith moved through a different zone of the realm, pursuing her own trajectory, racing toward the completion she believed she could reach before him. He perceived her without effort—the thread that connected them stretched across whatever distance the realm permitted, humming with the connection that the rooftop had revealed and the boundary-flicker had confirmed.

She was close to him. Not in space—space was optional here—but in something else. In progress, perhaps. In the work they were both doing, the wheel they were both turning on. Nine fetters broken to his three, but the distance between them was somehow smaller than the numbers suggested.

*We are approaching the same place.*

The thought arrived with the quality of insight: not something he was thinking, but something showing itself. Two threads, different colors, different textures, woven through the same pattern. They looked separate because separation was what patterns required to be patterns. But the weaving served something larger than either thread.

*What if the "one Buddha per world-system" rule meant exactly what it said?*

The question opened a door he hadn't known was there. One. Not two in competition, where one must fail for the other to succeed. One, appearing as two until the appearance was no longer necessary. One, playing both parts until the play completed itself.

The word that meant "loving-kindness" hovered at the edge of the thought, never arriving as word but present as quality. The one who was coming. The future completion. Named for the very thing that would make competition obsolete: the recognition that separate interests were never separate, that his welfare and hers were the same welfare, that the race she ran was a race against herself by another name.

*She will see it when she sees it.*

He released the insight without grasping. There was nothing to do with it, no intervention that would help. She would arrive at her own recognition through her own path, and that path would include all the racing and grasping and near-missing that her particular pattern required.

As if summoned by his attention—or by the realm's sensitivity to intention—she manifested closer. Not fully present, but more than the distant hum of connection. She offered something.

*Stay.*

The communication arrived without words, without even the structured meaning that had passed between them earlier. Pure intention, pure invitation. The deva realm spread behind her offer like paradise glimpsed: endless beauty, perfect rest, the cessation of striving that she was somehow promising even as she continued to strive.

*The path continues,* he responded. *You know this.*

*Does it?* Her intention carried something that might have been doubt, might have been temptation, might have been her own fierce hope that he would choose stillness and leave the race to her. *The realm offers everything. Why return to density? Why accept the weight of flesh again?*

*Because the wheel hasn't stopped turning.*

*The wheel is illusion. You said so yourself—on the rooftop, in the moment of reaching. The one turning was never there.*

True. The wheel was illusion—but illusion didn't mean nonexistent. It meant not-what-it-appeared-to-be. The wheel turned; the one who believed himself trapped on it had been optional. Both statements true simultaneously. The path continued not because he needed to escape the wheel, but because the wheel itself was still completing its motion, and completion required participation.

*I'm returning,* he said. *Once more.*

Something shifted in her distant presence. The offer retracted—or revealed itself as attempt, as strategy wearing the mask of generosity. She had wanted him to stay. Not for his benefit but for hers: if he rested in the deva realm, she would have time to complete her race, would arrive first, would prove herself the worthy one.

The backfire was instantaneous and complete.

By offering him rest, she had clarified his reason for moving. By tempting him toward stillness, she had crystallized his recognition of what stillness would cost. Her intervention—her final move in this chapter of their competition—had become the catalyst that propelled him toward the very return she'd hoped to prevent.

Again. Always again. Across 300,000 years, her attempts to derail him had been the friction that forged his progress. She couldn't see it. She would see it, eventually. But not yet, and not through anything he could say.

*Lilith.*

She was already withdrawing, already adjusting her strategy, already racing onward through her own trajectory. But she paused—or something paused—and the connection between them held one moment longer.

*I know what you are,* she communicated. *What you're becoming. It doesn't matter. I will be there first.*

*We will be there together.*

The response left him without intention, without decision. Simply true, offered without expectation of reception. She received it, processed it, dismissed it. The withdrawal completed. She was gone—or elsewhere in the realm—still pursuing, still grasping, still missing the thing she had almost touched when their boundaries had flickered into each other.

The realm began to thin around his awareness.

Not dissolution—something more like focusing. The broad availability of the deva realm, its everything-present quality, was narrowing toward a point. Time asserting itself. Sequence manifesting. The physics of duration replacing the timelessness that had held since arrival.

Something ahead.

He could perceive it without seeing it: a world, a future, a density waiting to receive the awareness that would inhabit it. Not the world he'd left—Manchester's grey skies, the faculty housing's familiar cracks. Something else. Something changed. Earth, but Earth transformed, Earth continuing into a future he couldn't yet perceive clearly.

The Prophet's world. The once-returner's destination.

The realm released him—or he released himself from it—and the transition was not falling but arriving, not ending but beginning, the threshold opening onto whatever the pattern required next.

Behind him—below him—around him—the deva realm continued its harmonics, available to any who chose to rest in it. Ahead, the density of time and form and the final lessons waiting to be learned.

And somewhere, Lilith racing toward the same destination, carrying the same thread, wearing the other face of a pattern that was slowly, across lifetimes beyond counting, revealing itself as one.
