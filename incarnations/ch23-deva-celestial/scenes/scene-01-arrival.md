The light tasted like arrival.

Or: arrival wore the quality of light—the distinction had collapsed into something truer than either, a synesthesia that wasn't confusion but clarity, the way water isn't confused about being wet. What had been called Silas registered this without organs, perceived without the machinery of perception, and the absence of eyes made seeing more, not less.

There was no body.

The recognition came without horror. Like discovering that weight was optional, that breath had been a habit rather than a requirement, that the architecture of flesh which had housed him across ten thousand mornings had been—what? Useful. Necessary, once. No longer.

He searched for the familiar sensations: heartbeat thrumming against ribs, blood coursing through vessels, the particular pressure of standing on ground. Nothing. The search itself was a gesture without hands, an orientation without direction. Where the body should have been, there was space. Where the space should have been empty, there was presence.

Something that remembered warmth but wasn't temperature.

Something that recalled pressure but required no skin.

The phantom architecture of a form recently vacated, still holding its shape in the consciousness that had once believed itself confined to muscle and bone.

*I am—*

The sentence couldn't complete. The pronoun kept searching for its referent and finding only the searching itself. Not "I am nothing"—that would require an I to be nothing. Closer to: there is awareness. There is presence. There is the registration of a realm that has no edges because edges require bodies to bump against them.

The Deva Realm—if that name meant anything—didn't look like anything at first.

Or it looked like everything: geometry singing, color vibrating with meaning that bypassed the need for interpretation, space that curved according to attention rather than mass. What the awareness attended to became *here*. What it released became *there*. The distinction was optional. The distinctions were all optional now.

He—if "he" still applied to what remained after the machinery of selfhood had thinned to transparency—moved by directing intention. Not walking. Not floating. Something that registered like locomotion but had no legs to employ, no distance to cross. The physics of consciousness operating by laws that matter had never obeyed.

Other presences faintly perceived. Luminous, distant, vast—beings that had inhabited this realm for durations that made human time look like a single breath in a life measured by breathing. They noticed him without approaching. Their attention was their greeting, and the greeting required no response.

The weight was gone.

Not just the weight of flesh—though that absence hummed like the silence after a bell stops ringing—but the weight of the one who had carried the flesh. The compulsion to help, to save, to be the pivot on which rescue turned: where had it gone? He searched for the harness that had wrapped around his chest since before he'd known it was there, the urgent need to matter, to make the difference, to carry the burden that would prove his worth.

Gone. Not suppressed, not overcome through effort or insight. Simply absent, the way a coat falls away when you've forgotten you were wearing it.

The ten lives flickered at the edges of awareness—Ka's frozen isolation, Chandra's arithmetic of compassion, Philon's fatal martyrdom, all of them present without intruding, lessons carried rather than memories retrieved. They were him. They were not him. The distinction between those statements had become irrelevant in a realm where identity was a convenience rather than a container.

He attended to the realm, and the realm responded.

Structures that might have been architecture if architecture could flow. Color frequencies that carried emotional content without requiring interpretation—not "this is beautiful" but beauty itself, unmediated, arriving directly at what would have been the heart if hearts existed here. Temperature as meaning: this zone of the realm felt welcoming the way certain silences feel welcoming, without needing warmth to convey warmth.

The body's absence was relief.

He hadn't known how heavy it was—not the physical weight, which had been negligible, but the weight of needing it, maintaining it, dragging it through decades of sleeping and waking and feeding and protecting. The meat he'd worn for forty-three years in his last configuration had been the latest in a series stretching back 300,000 years, and all of it had been labor he hadn't recognized as labor until now, when the labor was done.

What remains when the meat is gone?

The question arose without urgency. The answer was already present: this. Awareness. Presence. The registration of a realm that sang with frequencies too refined for ears that no longer existed. The capacity for experience without the experiencer who had once believed himself essential to the experiencing.

*I am boundless awareness.*

The mantra surfaced from habit, and the humor of it registered without laughter—laughter would have required a body to shake, breath to expel, the whole apparatus of mirth that now seemed so elaborate, so unnecessary. The mantra was a description of what had always been true, a map he'd been studying while standing in the territory the map described.

The realm extended in directions that had no names.

There was something like "up" and something like "far" and something like "inward," but these were translations for a mind that still reached for spatial coordinates. The actual experience was more like: everything present at once, available to attention, waiting to be explored by the simple act of attending.

And beneath the wonder—or woven through it, inseparable from it—a question forming without words:

*What remains to be done?*

Because something did remain. The wheel was still turning, even here. The progress made was real, but progress implies incompleteness, a distance still to travel. The first three fetters broken on a rooftop in Manchester—self-illusion, doubt, attachment to rites—but others persisted. He could sense them like weather at the edge of awareness: sensual desire, ill-will, the subtler attachments that would require more dissolving before the turning could stop.

The realm hummed with patience. There was no hurry here. Duration itself was optional, a parameter that could be adjusted by attention or ignored entirely. But the trajectory persisted: forward momentum, the once-returner's arc, the path that continued through this realm rather than ending in it.

He would learn what came next by moving through it.

And so awareness—what had been Silas, what was now simply the registering itself—oriented toward the realm's deeper structures, ready to explore what the absence of body made possible.

The light continued to taste like arrival. And arrival continued, unfolding, patient as everything here was patient, waiting for him to discover what he already was.
