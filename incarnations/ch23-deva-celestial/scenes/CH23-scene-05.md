The realm's quality was changing.

Not in its substance—the light-frequencies still sang, the deva beings still radiated their patient welcome, the structures of pure intention still flowed through space that wasn't space. But the awareness that moved through it registered a new texture: edge. Threshold. The sense of having traveled far enough through to glimpse what lay beyond.

*Not ending. Transitioning.*

The distinction mattered. The deva realm would continue its harmonics long after this consciousness had moved on—would continue for durations that bodies couldn't measure, until conditions shifted and even celestial beauty found its conclusion. Nothing here was ending. Something here was completing.

Two fetters had loosened their grip, not through effort but through exposure to a realm where gripping served no purpose. Sensual desire had revealed itself as optional in the garden's perfect pleasure. Ill-will had revealed itself as empty in the encounter with Lilith, where opposition could find no purchase on a self too transparent to defend.

*What remains?*

The question had texture now, specificity. He could perceive the remaining bindings—not as theoretical categories from texts he'd studied, but as actual patterns still woven through awareness.

Desire for fine-material existence: the pull toward realms like this one, beautiful and refined, where friction was so subtle it could be mistaken for its absence. He could feel it—the temptation to rest here, to declare the journey complete, to accept celestial residence as destination rather than station.

Desire for immaterial existence: the deeper pull toward realms beyond even this refinement, formless awareness dwelling in formless bliss. The deva realm still had structure, still had the ghost of space and the memory of time. What lay beyond it might offer even less resistance, even more dissolution. That, too, was temptation.

Conceit: the subtle "I am" that persisted even when self had become transparent. Not the gross pride of achievement, but the simple fact of identification—"this awareness is mine, these insights are my insights, this progress is my progress." Even here, even after the rooftop's dissolution, the habit of ownership continued.

Restlessness: the urge toward movement for movement's sake, the inability to rest in what was present without scanning for what came next. He could feel it operating now—the forward momentum that had carried him through ten lives, useful and necessary and also, potentially, another form of grasping.

And beneath all of them, beneath everything learned and everything remaining to learn: ignorance. The root condition. The fundamental not-seeing that had made all the other blindnesses possible. It persisted, patient, waiting to be seen through by an awareness that had not yet developed the capacity to see through it.

*The wheel still turns.*

Not failure. Progress was real—the fetters loosening, the clarity increasing, the seeing becoming more accurate with each turn of the pattern. But progress implied incompleteness. The path continued because the path had not yet ended.

And then: her presence again. Distant but unmistakable.

Lilith moved through a different zone of the realm, pursuing her own trajectory, racing toward the completion she believed she could reach before him. He perceived her without effort—the thread that connected them stretched across whatever distance the realm permitted, humming with the connection that the rooftop had revealed and the boundary-flicker had confirmed.

She was close to him. Not in space—space was optional here—but in something else. In progress, perhaps. In the work they were both doing, the wheel they were both turning on. Nine fetters broken to his three, but the distance between them was somehow smaller than the numbers suggested.

*We are approaching the same place.*

The thought arrived with the quality of insight: not something he was thinking, but something showing itself. Two threads, different colors, different textures, woven through the same pattern. They looked separate because separation was what patterns required to be patterns. But the weaving served something larger than either thread.

*What if the "one Buddha per world-system" rule meant exactly what it said?*

The question opened a door he hadn't known was there. One. Not two in competition, where one must fail for the other to succeed. One, appearing as two until the appearance was no longer necessary. One, playing both parts until the play completed itself.

The word that meant "loving-kindness" hovered at the edge of the thought, never arriving as word but present as quality. The one who was coming. The future completion. Named for the very thing that would make competition obsolete: the recognition that separate interests were never separate, that his welfare and hers were the same welfare, that the race she ran was a race against herself by another name.

*She will see it when she sees it.*

He released the insight without grasping. There was nothing to do with it, no intervention that would help. She would arrive at her own recognition through her own path, and that path would include all the racing and grasping and near-missing that her particular pattern required.

As if summoned by his attention—or by the realm's sensitivity to intention—she manifested closer. Not fully present, but more than the distant hum of connection. She offered something.

*Stay.*

The communication arrived without words, without even the structured meaning that had passed between them earlier. Pure intention, pure invitation. The deva realm spread behind her offer like paradise glimpsed: endless beauty, perfect rest, the cessation of striving that she was somehow promising even as she continued to strive.

*The path continues,* he responded. *You know this.*

*Does it?* Her intention carried something that might have been doubt, might have been temptation, might have been her own fierce hope that he would choose stillness and leave the race to her. *The realm offers everything. Why return to density? Why accept the weight of flesh again?*

*Because the wheel hasn't stopped turning.*

*The wheel is illusion. You said so yourself—on the rooftop, in the moment of reaching. The one turning was never there.*

True. The wheel was illusion—but illusion didn't mean nonexistent. It meant not-what-it-appeared-to-be. The wheel turned; the one who believed himself trapped on it had been optional. Both statements true simultaneously. The path continued not because he needed to escape the wheel, but because the wheel itself was still completing its motion, and completion required participation.

*I'm returning,* he said. *Once more.*

Something shifted in her distant presence. The offer retracted—or revealed itself as attempt, as strategy wearing the mask of generosity. She had wanted him to stay. Not for his benefit but for hers: if he rested in the deva realm, she would have time to complete her race, would arrive first, would prove herself the worthy one.

The backfire was instantaneous and complete.

By offering him rest, she had clarified his reason for moving. By tempting him toward stillness, she had crystallized his recognition of what stillness would cost. Her intervention—her final move in this chapter of their competition—had become the catalyst that propelled him toward the very return she'd hoped to prevent.

Again. Always again. Across 300,000 years, her attempts to derail him had been the friction that forged his progress. She couldn't see it. She would see it, eventually. But not yet, and not through anything he could say.

*Lilith.*

She was already withdrawing, already adjusting her strategy, already racing onward through her own trajectory. But she paused—or something paused—and the connection between them held one moment longer.

*I know what you are,* she communicated. *What you're becoming. It doesn't matter. I will be there first.*

*We will be there together.*

The response left him without intention, without decision. Simply true, offered without expectation of reception. She received it, processed it, dismissed it. The withdrawal completed. She was gone—or elsewhere in the realm—still pursuing, still grasping, still missing the thing she had almost touched when their boundaries had flickered into each other.

The realm began to thin around his awareness.

Not dissolution—something more like focusing. The broad availability of the deva realm, its everything-present quality, was narrowing toward a point. Time asserting itself. Sequence manifesting. The physics of duration replacing the timelessness that had held since arrival.

Something ahead.

He could perceive it without seeing it: a world, a future, a density waiting to receive the awareness that would inhabit it. Not the world he'd left—Manchester's grey skies, the faculty housing's familiar cracks. Something else. Something changed. Earth, but Earth transformed, Earth continuing into a future he couldn't yet perceive clearly.

The Prophet's world. The once-returner's destination.

The realm released him—or he released himself from it—and the transition was not falling but arriving, not ending but beginning, the threshold opening onto whatever the pattern required next.

Behind him—below him—around him—the deva realm continued its harmonics, available to any who chose to rest in it. Ahead, the density of time and form and the final lessons waiting to be learned.

And somewhere, Lilith racing toward the same destination, carrying the same thread, wearing the other face of a pattern that was slowly, across lifetimes beyond counting, revealing itself as one.
