The encounter had shifted his orientation.

The realm continued its harmonics, its light-frequencies, its patient availability to whatever chose to move through it. The shift was subtler: an orientation adjusted, an angle changed, a question answered without anyone asking it.

*What was there ever to resist?*

The question surfaced in the awareness that had just released Lilith to her racing, and the question was its own answer. The impulse to push back, to fight against, to convert threat into opposition—where had it gone? He searched for it the way he'd searched for the body on arrival, expecting to find familiar machinery and discovering only its absence.

The fifth fetter: ill-will. Hatred. Aversion. The reactive pushing-away that had driven behavior across ten thousand moments in ten lifetimes, shaping choices before they reached the level of choice.

Ka's rage at the tribe who didn't understand his hoarding—a defensive snarl, meat protected by the willingness to bite. Chandra's fury at the corruption that had made his careful arithmetic meaningless. Philon's disgust at the citizens who abandoned their slaves to plague. Verinus's cold anger at a system that rewarded the unjust. All of it flickered at the edges of awareness, a montage of resistance spanning 300,000 years.

*I pushed against so much.*

The recognition came without judgment—judgment would have been another form of pushing. Simply observation: this had been the pattern. This was what he'd done. Across lifetimes of learning, the aversion-mechanism had hummed beneath every response to what he didn't want, creating tension, creating separation, creating the illusion that he was a thing being acted upon by things he had to resist.

But here, in the realm without body, without nervous system, without the biology that generated fight-or-flight—

Nothing to resist.

The deva beings didn't threaten. The realm itself offered no opposition. Even Lilith, with her manipulation and her racing and her desperate grasping at a prize that would dissolve the moment she touched it—she wasn't an enemy. She couldn't be an enemy. Enmity required a self to be protected, and the self had thinned to transparency on a rooftop in Manchester, had continued thinning in the garden of delights, had finally become see-through in the moment when he and Lilith had flickered into each other's perception and back.

*I just met someone who's actively trying to obstruct me.*

The thought examined the Lilith encounter from this new angle. She'd created fog around his path. She'd tried to seduce him into the garden's stillness. She was, by any reasonable definition, an obstacle.

And he'd felt no opposition.

He hadn't suppressed it—suppression was just aversion with a different mask. He hadn't cultivated equanimity through careful practice, building tolerance like muscle. The opposition simply wasn't there. The machinery that would have converted "she's blocking my path" into "I must resist her blocking" had revealed itself as optional.

The Lilith who raced against him was also the Lilith who flickered into him, who shared his awareness for that moment of merged perception, who was somehow part of a pattern larger than either of them separately perceived. Resisting her would be resisting himself. And resisting himself—

*There's no one to resist.*

The insight landed with the force of recognition rather than discovery. Of course there was no one to resist. Of course aversion was as empty as attraction, as optional as the body he'd set down. The self that would have marshaled defenses, that would have identified threats and generated responses—that self had been a convenience. A useful fiction for navigating a world where fictions were useful. Here, where convenience was unnecessary, the fiction served no purpose.

What remained after ill-will loosened its grip?

The awareness rested in the question, present with the inquiry, curious about what would emerge.

Action remained possible. He could still move—had moved, away from the garden's stillness, toward whatever lay beyond. Choice persisted: paths could be taken, attention could be directed, intentions could form and dissolve. But the mechanism that had once weighted choices toward pushing-away had become neutral.

Engagement without resistance.

Movement toward without movement against.

Active participation in what was happening, without the friction of wishing it were happening differently—more than passive acceptance.

*This is what comes after.*

Suppression, forced calm, disciplined restraint of someone gritting through discomfort—none of these. The actual absence of the impulse to push back. The fetter loosening until it no longer gripped, falling away like weight set down after being carried so long its presence had become invisible.

The deva realm hummed with its patience. There was no hurry here—that remained true. But a new truth was emerging alongside it: time beginning to matter again. Duration, though differing from the measured time of bodies and worlds, of clocks and calendars. Sequence. A pointer toward what came next rather than the eternal present the garden offered.

*The realm is passage, never destination.*

He'd known this already—had perceived it in the deva beings' stillness, in the garden's trap of perfect pleasure. But now the knowing had texture. The once-returner's trajectory meant return. The path continued because the path was incomplete. Two fetters loosening here—sensual desire and ill-will, the pair that bounded reborn existence in the sensory realms—but others remained.

Desire for fine-material existence. Desire for immaterial existence. Conceit. Restlessness. The root of it all, ignorance, still present beneath everything learned.

The wheel still turned. Even here, in a realm that seemed to have transcended turning, the wheel's momentum persisted in the one who had entered it. Momentum was how progress happened, how one state led to the next, how the path could be walked at all. Simply incompleteness.

The awareness that had been Silas oriented toward what lay ahead. Without the old urgency that would have been another form of grasping. Without resistance toward the comfortable realm being left. Simply with attention, with intention, with the forward momentum that had characterized ten lives of learning and would characterize however many lives remained.

Time was beginning to matter again. The sensation was strange: duration emerging from timelessness, sequence manifesting where sequence had been irrelevant. It pointed toward embodiment. Toward the density of existence that the deva realm had floated above.

Toward return.

*Once-returner.*

The name implied exactly what it said. One more time in form. One more life to complete what lifetimes had begun. The deva realm was passage; the path continued through it toward what came next.

And ahead—glimpsed rather than seen—lay the quality of futures, of time, of the world he'd left when Manchester's morning opened into this.
