The magistrate's chambers smelled of old parchment and wet stone—the scent of institutional permanence threatened by the season's rains. Jean de Langon stood before Bernard de Lacaze's desk and watched candlelight carve the older man's face into planes of judgment and exhaustion. Outside, Bordeaux settled into evening. Inside, the document between them held more danger than any sword Jean had carried on the road.

"Henri de Ségur," de Lacaze said. The name alone was sufficient. Everyone in Guyenne knew what it meant when a Protestant notable died on the road between factions.

Jean touched his thumb to his index finger, then to the next, counting the possibilities as one counts coins. "The reports claim Catholic action, I assume."

"The reports claim many things." De Lacaze pushed the document forward—depositions, witness statements, a complaint filed by de Ségur's widow that named half the Catholic League in Bordeaux. "What they do not claim is consistency."

Jean picked up the topmost page. The hand was educated, the accusations specific. A merchant had seen riders in Catholic livery. A farmer placed armed men near the ambush site at dawn. The widow herself swore de Ségur had received threats from Father Sorbin's circle.

"And the whispers?" Jean asked, because there were always whispers, and de Lacaze would not have summoned him for a simple investigation.

The magistrate rose and moved to the window. Rain streaked the glass, turning the city beyond into shapes that might have been buildings or might have been the memory of order slowly dissolving. "The whispers suggest Henri de Ségur was a moderate. That he was in communication with the Crown. That certain Protestant commanders would prefer a war to a negotiated peace."

Jean set the paper down. His shoulder—the old wound from a roadside encounter six years past—began its familiar ache. Rain always woke it. So did danger one could not see coming.

"You are asking me," Jean said carefully, measuring each word as he measured evidence, "to determine whether the Catholics murdered a Protestant moderate, or whether the Protestants murdered one of their own and blame the Catholics to justify reprisals."

"I am asking you to investigate." De Lacaze's voice carried the weight of a man who had maintained order in Guyenne through eight years of intermittent war and who knew how fragile that order remained. "To gather testimony. To examine the site. To provide me with the truth of what occurred."

The truth. Jean touched his fingers again—thumb to index, index to middle, middle to ring, ring to small. A measuring gesture, as if the truth were something one could weigh and count. Perhaps once he had believed that.

"And if the truth is not...useful?"

De Lacaze turned from the window. The candlelight caught his face differently now—older, wearier, a man who understood exactly what he was asking. "Then I will have an investigation that produced truth. One supposes there is virtue in that."

One supposes. The language of men who knew better than to claim certainty but who must act regardless. Jean had built his life on such language, on the professional neutrality that allowed him to serve magistrates of both confessions, to be useful without being owned. It had kept him alive. It had kept him, he sometimes thought, from having to choose anything that mattered.

"The road to the site?" Jean asked, because the practical questions were easier than the philosophical ones, and because he had already accepted. One did not refuse Bernard de Lacaze, and more importantly, one did not refuse the possibility that careful investigation might yet find something true.

"Patrols from both sides. You'll need letters of passage." De Lacaze produced them from a drawer—documents signed and sealed, stating Jean de Langon acted under the authority of the Parlement. "Captain de Castelnau commands the Protestant forces in the region. Father Sorbin represents Catholic interests. Both have been informed you are coming. Both will wish to ensure you find the correct conclusions."

Jean took the letters. The seals were authentic, the signatures properly witnessed. They would protect him or condemn him depending on what he found. "How long do I have?"

"The widow petitions for resolution. The Crown wishes to know if the incident threatens the peace. The Catholic League claims Protestant aggression. The Protestant command claims Catholic assassination." De Lacaze's voice was steady, but his hands, visible now in the candlelight, bore ink stains and the slight tremor of a man who had not slept well in some time. "You have as long as it takes to determine the truth. You have three weeks before I must report to the Parlement."

Three weeks to untangle a killing both factions had already weaponized. Three weeks to find truth in a province where truth was the rarest commodity, hoarded and counterfeit in equal measure.

Jean gathered the documents, folding them carefully into his leather case. The letters of passage went into an inner pocket, close to his chest where they would stay dry and where a knife would have to cut deep to reach them.

"I will send word as I have findings to report," Jean said, and heard the careful hedge in his own voice—*findings*, not *conclusions*; *as I have*, not *when*. The language of a man who knew how to avoid commitment even in his promises.

"God keep you on the road," de Lacaze said, and it was not merely formula. On the roads of Guyenne in 1588, one required all the keeping one could pray for.

Jean descended the magistrate's stairs into a Bordeaux evening turned dark with rain. His horse waited in the courtyard, already saddled by the magistrate's groom—a preparation that spoke of de Lacaze's certainty that Jean would accept, or perhaps of the older man's need to have this investigation begun before sunset.

The cobblestones gleamed wet under the courtyard torches. Somewhere in the city, bells rang vespers. Jean mounted, feeling the familiar adjustment of weight, the settling of the sword against his hip. He had perhaps an hour of light remaining if he rode now. He could reach an inn he knew, one that asked few questions and where both factions passed without excessive violence.

Or he could wait until morning, and spend the night turning the documents over in his mind, looking for the shape of the thing before the thing itself appeared.

The horse shifted beneath him. Jean touched his reins and felt the animal's readiness, the desire to be moving rather than standing in the rain.

He turned toward the city gate. The investigation had already begun, whether he willed it or not. The only question now was what truth it would find, and what that truth would cost.

Behind him, a light still burned in the magistrate's window. Ahead, the road stretched dark into the countryside where a man had died and where the story of his death waited to be gathered, weighed, and delivered to those who would use it however they required.

Jean touched his fingers to his thumb one final time—counting, measuring, testing the weight of a thing he could not yet see—and rode through the gate into the gathering dark.


The inn called itself the Rose and Crown, a name that claimed neutrality through royal appeal while the rose itself might signify Lancaster or simply the vine that grew over the stable door. Jean had learned to read such ambiguities. In 1588, survival often depended on symbols that could mean whatever the armed observer required them to mean.

He sat in the common room and listened to Martin Dufour describe the murder. The merchant was a thick man gone soft in his middle years, prosperous enough to travel with goods but not wealthy enough to avoid the roads. His hands moved as he spoke, sketching shapes in the air as if the gestures might lend his words additional substance.

"Protestant riders," Dufour said. "I saw them clear as I see you, Monsieur. Three men, maybe four, in the livery of the Navarre forces. They came past me on the road at speed, not two hours after I'd passed the place where they found poor de Ségur."

Jean touched his index finger to his thumb. "You saw their livery clearly? At speed?"

"Clear enough. The white scarf, the plume. Protestant badges." Dufour's certainty had the quality of a man who knew what answer would serve his interests. He was Catholic—Jean had established that within the first three questions—and Catholic merchants who testified against Protestant raiders might expect certain protections, certain preferential treatment when the next convoy needed passage.

"And you saw the riders before you discovered the body?"

"After, Monsieur. I passed the site—saw nothing amiss, God be thanked—and met the riders perhaps a league onward. It was only when I reached the next town that I heard de Ségur had been killed on that very stretch."

Jean made a note. The merchant had seen riders. He had later heard of a killing. Between the two events, his memory had helpfully arranged the riders into murderers wearing identifiable Protestant markings. Whether this was honest error or useful invention, Jean could not determine from words alone.

"I am grateful for your testimony," Jean said, and watched Dufour's face brighten at the suggestion his account had been believed.

---

The Protestant household was less welcoming.

Arnaud Besse received Jean in a parlor that smelled of beeswax and the righteousness of the persecuted. He was a farmer, prosperous by the standards of the land, and his home bore the marks of a man who had survived by never quite provoking the authorities while never quite submitting to them.

"Catholic soldiers," Besse said. His voice was flat, certain, carrying the weight of a man who had watched his neighbors killed and his fields burned and who no longer troubled himself with doubts about which faction meant him harm. "I saw them the morning of the killing. Before dawn, lurking near the crossroads where they found Henri."

"How many?" Jean asked.

"Six. Maybe seven. Armed men, with the look of League soldiers about them."

Jean's shoulder gave a twinge. Rain was coming, or perhaps it was merely the proximity to something that would draw blood. "You saw them clearly? Before dawn?"

"I know soldiers when I see them." Besse's jaw set. "And I know Catholic movements when they come through my land without asking leave."

Jean touched his thumb to his middle finger, counting the certainties that stacked like coins and spent like counterfeits. "Did you see their colors? Any insignia?"

"I saw armed Catholics near the place where a Protestant moderate was murdered." Besse leaned forward. "What more insignia does a man require?"

Everything else, Jean thought, but did not say. A soldier's livery. A specific commission. Some detail that could be verified beyond the witness's own conviction that Catholics must be guilty because Catholics had been guilty before.

"I am grateful for your testimony," Jean said again, and saw Besse's face harden at the formulaic courtesy—a hardening that suggested the farmer knew his account had been noted but not necessarily credited.

---

The third witness Jean found at the site itself.

The crossroads where they had discovered de Ségur's body lay a half-day's ride from Bordeaux, in country that belonged to no faction strongly enough to prevent the other's passage. The site had been cleared—the body removed, the blood washed away by rain—but the servant who had found the corpse still worked at a nearby estate.

Her name was Lisette. She was perhaps nineteen, thin in the way of those whose meals depend on their employer's temperament. She met Jean in the kitchen yard, away from the house, where the steward could not easily overhear.

"I heard them arguing," she said, and Jean's hand stilled on his notes.

"Arguing? When?"

"The night before they found him. I was bringing wine to the private dining room at my master's house—de Ségur was a guest here, see, on his way to Bordeaux. He was in the parlor with another gentleman. A Protestant gentleman, by the sound of their talk."

Jean touched each finger in sequence. "You heard them argue about what?"

"I didn't understand it all, Monsieur. But I heard de Ségur say something about negotiations, about the Crown's offer, about how war served no one. And the other man—he was angry. Said de Ségur was betraying the cause, selling out for royal favor."

"Did you see this other man?"

Lisette shook her head. "Only heard him. But he was angry, Monsieur. The kind of angry that doesn't forget."

Jean wrote carefully. Here was testimony that served neither faction's simple narrative—neither the Catholic murder nor the Protestant defense. Here was suggestion that de Ségur had been killed by his own people for the crime of seeking peace.

"And in the morning?"

"In the morning, de Ségur rode out early. I saw him leave. The other gentleman had gone in the night—I don't know when. And then that afternoon, they brought back de Ségur's body from the crossroads."

Jean looked at the girl's face. She was frightened, he saw. Frightened of what she had heard, frightened of having spoken of it, frightened of the men on both sides who would prefer their simple stories to her complicated truth.

"You have told no one else of this argument?"

"Who would I tell, Monsieur? The Catholics would say it proves nothing. The Protestants would say I lie. And de Ségur is dead either way." Her eyes met his—direct, weary, old beyond her years. "I am telling you because you asked. But I don't know what good the truth does when both sides have already decided what they believe."

---

Jean rode back to his inn as evening fell. Three witnesses. Three mutually exclusive accounts.

The Catholic merchant had seen Protestant raiders fleeing the scene—except he had seen them after passing the site, before he knew a murder had occurred, and his memory had helpfully filled in details that served his faction's narrative.

The Protestant farmer had seen Catholic soldiers lurking at dawn—except what he had actually seen was armed men, and his certainty about their confession came from years of justified grievance rather than any specific insignia.

The servant had heard de Ségur arguing with a fellow Protestant about betraying the cause—but she had not seen the man, could not name him, and her testimony would be dismissed by both sides as the confusion of an ignorant girl.

Jean touched his fingers in sequence, counting the contradictions. His training said: investigate further, cross-reference, find the inconsistencies that would reveal which account was false. But each account was internally consistent. Each witness believed their own testimony. And each version of events led to a different conclusion about who had killed Henri de Ségur and why.

The rain began as he reached the inn. Jean stabled his horse and climbed the stairs to his room, where his notes lay spread across a table like pieces of a pattern that would not resolve into sense.

This was the work he had built his reputation on: weighing testimony, finding truth beneath the claims of interested parties. He was good at it. He had always been good at it.

But tonight, for the first time in his career, Jean understood with cold clarity that his tools produced only questions. Three witnesses. Three truths. And no way to determine which—if any—matched the thing that had actually occurred on the road where Henri de Ségur had died.

He lit a candle against the gathering dark and began writing his preliminary report. The merchant claims Protestant riders. The farmer claims Catholic soldiers. The servant claims factional conflict within Protestant ranks. Each account plausible. Each account unverifiable.

The pen scratched. The candle burned. And Jean felt the first small crack in the fortress of doubt he had mistaken for wisdom.


The road between market towns ran through oak forest thick enough to muffle sound and channel sight into the narrow corridor of packed earth that passed for passage. Jean rode with his hand loose on his reins and his attention spread across the middle distance—not staring at any one shadow, but holding all of them in peripheral awareness. A man learned this, traveling alone through country where factions maintained order only within sight of their own walls.

His shoulder ached. The rain had passed but left the air heavy with the promise of more, and old wounds remembered weather before the sky did.

The first arrow missed him by a hand's breadth.

Jean heard the snap of the bowstring and the hiss of the shaft and then his horse was screaming and rearing and he was already moving—left boot out of stirrup, weight shifting, hands releasing the reins as he threw himself sideways out of the saddle. He hit the ground hard on his good shoulder and rolled, hearing the second arrow thud into earth where his chest had been.

Three men came out of the trees. Masked. Armed with blades now that the arrows had failed to drop him cleanly.

Jean drew his sword as he found his feet. The blade cleared the scabbard in one practiced motion, though his left arm already burned from the fall and his right hand had to do the work of both. One of the attackers swung high—an opening cut meant to test his guard or draw him into overextension.

Jean parried and stepped inside the man's reach. Close work now. The kind of fighting that happened on roads and in alleys, where there was no space for elegance and survival depended on doing the ugliest thing first.

He drove his pommel into the attacker's masked face and felt bone give. The man went down. Jean spun to meet the second—a thinner fighter, faster, with a short sword and a dagger in the off-hand. The kind of combination a man used when he knew his business.

They circled. Jean's breath came hard. The third attacker had moved to flank him, and his horse had fled, and the trees that had provided the ambush now provided cover for however many other men might be waiting.

The fast one lunged. Jean parried the sword and felt the dagger come searching for his ribs—a feint within the primary attack, the kind of doubled strike that killed men who thought they had successfully defended. Jean twisted, taking the dagger point on his leather jack rather than his flesh, and cut low across the man's lead leg.

The blade bit deep. The attacker stumbled and Jean was already moving—pivot, cut upward, feel the sword meet resistance and then break through as the man's throat opened and blood sprayed black in the forest shadow.

The third man was running.

Jean let him go. His shoulder screamed where the old wound had torn something in the fall. His ribs hurt where the dagger had skipped across the leather. One man was dead. One was crawling away with his face broken. And the third had decided survival meant abandoning whatever coin had bought his service today.

Jean bent and tore the mask from the dead man's face. Young. Perhaps twenty. Features that might have been from Bordeaux or from any of a dozen market towns in Guyenne. No livery beneath the rough traveling cloak. No insignia. Nothing to identify which faction had sent him or whether he was merely a brigand who saw a lone traveler and chose easy prey.

Jean searched the body with shaking hands. A few coins. A knife worn with honest use. A scrap of rosary—Catholic, or at least the affectation of Catholicism. But half the Protestants in France had been Catholic two decades ago, and rosaries were cheap, and a man might carry anything if it helped him pass a checkpoint.

The wounded attacker had stopped crawling and now lay still, breathing in wet gasps. Jean moved to him and pulled off the mask. Older. Scarred across one cheek. Eyes that tracked Jean's movement with animal awareness of mortality.

"Who sent you?" Jean asked.

The man spat blood. Said nothing.

Jean pressed his sword point to the hollow of the man's throat—not breaking skin, but resting there with the weight of a promise. "I am Jean de Langon, agent of the Parlement. Tell me who commissioned this and I will see you to a surgeon."

The man's eyes met his. For a moment Jean thought he would speak, would offer some name or some faction identifier that would make sense of this. Instead the man smiled—a red grimace that showed broken teeth—and said, "Figure it out yourself, investigator."

Then he closed his eyes and Jean felt the body go slack in the way bodies did when men decided dying was easier than talking.

Jean sat back on his heels. His hands were shaking now that the fight was finished and the blood was cooling on his blade. He wiped the sword on the dead man's cloak and sheathed it with a scrape of steel on wood that sounded too loud in the empty forest.

Who had sent them?

Catholic forces, eliminating a Protestant-sympathizing investigator before he could exonerate Catholics of de Ségur's murder?

Protestant forces, silencing someone who might dig too deep into the possibility of internal fratricide?

Or merely bandits, and Jean was manufacturing conspiracy from simple violence?

He could not know.

Jean found his horse a quarter mile down the road, trembling but uninjured. He mounted with difficulty, feeling every bruise from the fall settle into his frame. His ribs ached where the dagger had struck. His shoulder felt like someone had driven a spike through the joint.

But he was alive. Two men were not. And somewhere, someone had decided Jean's investigation was dangerous enough to warrant killing.

He touched his fingers in sequence—thumb to index, index to middle, middle to ring—counting the possibilities as he had counted them before. Catholic. Protestant. Brigand. Faction within faction. Personal vendetta from some previous case.

The gesture brought no certainty. Only the recognition that certainty was not available, and that the lack of certainty would not stop the next attack.

Jean rode on through the forest, watching the shadows, feeling the weight of the letter of passage in his pocket and knowing it would protect him only as long as whoever wanted him dead chose to respect the Parlement's authority. Which was to say, not at all.

His shoulder burned. His ribs throbbed. And somewhere ahead on this road lay more interviews, more testimony, more accumulating contradictions.

But now he knew: neutrality was not safety. Doubt was not protection. Both sides were watching, and both sides would act.

The question was no longer whether he could discover the truth about Henri de Ségur's death.

The question was whether he would survive the attempt.

Jean touched his fingers one more time—counting, measuring, testing the weight of a fortress he had thought secure—and felt the first stone in that fortress shift beneath his hand.


The print shop smelled of ink and metal—the tang of letters in their cases, the oil on the press mechanism, the chemical residue of whatever solvents kept the type clean enough to serve. Jean stood in the doorway and let his eyes adjust to the interior dimness. Afternoon light filtered through windows too small for the work they illuminated, falling in dusty shafts across tables covered in pages and proofs.

"Monsieur de Langon." The voice came from the back of the shop, where a woman stood beside a compositor's desk. She set down her work—a page of set type, Jean saw, dense with text—and moved forward with the economy of someone accustomed to navigating the shop's narrow aisles. "I wondered when the Parlement would send someone."

Marguerite Viret was perhaps thirty-eight, dressed in the dark wool of a widow who could not afford extended mourning but maintained its forms from habit or conviction. Her hair was dark, pulled back severely from a face that might have been called severe itself had her eyes not held a quality of careful intelligence that suggested severity was performance rather than temperament.

"Madame Viret." Jean inclined his head. "I seek information regarding Henri de Ségur. I am told he received correspondence through your establishment."

"Everyone receives correspondence through my establishment." She gestured to a cabinet against the wall. "We are printers, Monsieur. Words are our trade, whether bound in books or carried in letters."

"Specifically, I am interested in de Ségur's connections to the intellectual networks in Guyenne. His conversations. His...opinions."

Marguerite regarded him with eyes that seemed to look past his question to the motive beneath it. "You mean you wish to know if he was truly a moderate, or if the rumors of his negotiations with the Crown were propaganda manufactured by whichever faction benefits from the claim."

Jean touched his thumb to his index finger—a small gesture, counted without thought. "I wish to know what can be known. The rest is speculation."

"Is it?" She moved to a shelf and withdrew a folder of papers. "Come. I will show you what Henri de Ségur requested we print, and you may judge for yourself what it tells you about his opinions."

The documents were pamphlets—political, argumentative, calling for negotiated peace and mutual tolerance in language that would satisfy no one who believed satisfaction came through victory. Jean read while Marguerite watched, her hands resting on the compositor's desk with the stillness of someone accustomed to waiting.

"These would make him enemies," Jean said.

"These made him enemies in both camps." Marguerite's voice carried neither approval nor condemnation. "The Catholics saw Protestant duplicity. The Protestants saw betrayal. Truth, in such times, is simply the accusation that sticks hardest."

Jean looked up from the pamphlets. Something in her phrasing caught his attention—a philosophical precision unusual in a woman whose education came from trade rather than institution. "You do not believe in truth?"

"I believe truth exists." Marguerite met his gaze directly. "I do not believe it can be reliably accessed through human testimony. We see what serves our interests. We remember what confirms our grievances. And we call the result truth when it would be more honest to call it necessity."

The argument was clean. Skeptical in the mode Jean recognized from his own education at the Collège de Guyenne. Que sais-je? What do I know? And the answer, if one followed the logic far enough, was very little indeed.

"You have read the Essays," Jean said. Not a question—Montaigne's work was too visible in her speech for it to be coincidence.

"My husband printed a pirated edition." The ghost of something that might have been amusement crossed her face. "I set the type myself for several chapters. One cannot help but absorb the arguments when one must arrange them letter by letter."

Jean found himself smiling despite the ache in his ribs and the weight of the investigation. "And what did the type-setter conclude about Montaigne's philosophy?"

"That he asks better questions than he provides answers. Which may be the point." Marguerite gestured to the pamphlets. "Is this sufficient for your investigation?"

"It suggests de Ségur was sincere in his moderation. But sincerity is motive, not evidence. I still cannot determine who killed him."

"Perhaps that is because determination is not possible." Marguerite's voice was gentle, almost sympathetic, in a way that made Jean's hands tighten on the pamphlets. "You have contradictory testimonies. Unverifiable documents. Interested parties on all sides. What if the truth is that you cannot know?"

Jean set the pamphlets down carefully. "Then my investigation fails."

"Does it? Or does it succeed in establishing the boundaries of knowledge?" She leaned forward slightly. "There is a kind of honesty in admitting uncertainty. Perhaps more honest than forcing a conclusion to satisfy those who demand one."

The argument was seductive. Jean felt it slide beneath his professional armor like a blade testing for gaps. He had thought this himself, had he not? That honest doubt might be wiser than false certainty?

But to say so to a magistrate who required answers. To put it in a report that would determine whether Guyenne tumbled back into open war.

"I am charged with investigation, not philosophy," Jean said, and heard the defensiveness in his own voice.

"Are the two separable?" Marguerite asked. "You investigate to determine truth. But if the tools of investigation cannot reach truth—if testimony is unreliable, documents forgeable, evidence interpretable in multiple ways—then perhaps the investigation succeeds only in demonstrating what cannot be known."

Jean touched his fingers in sequence. Thumb to index. Index to middle. The familiar counting gesture that brought no certainty, only the illusion of measurement.

"You offer me a dilemma with no exit," he said quietly.

"I offer you what your own investigation has already found." Marguerite's gaze was steady, neither cruel nor kind—simply observant. "Contradiction without resolution. Three versions of one event. And the question: what does a man honestly report when honesty means acknowledging he cannot determine which version is true?"

Jean looked at her face in the dim light of the print shop. There was something in her stillness that seemed older than her years, as if the widow's grief had aged her in ways that went beyond the physical. Or perhaps it was simply the wisdom that came from surviving in a profession where every printed word might bring royal censors or factional reprisal.

"I thank you for your assistance," Jean said, and took the pamphlets she offered.

"If you require additional documents, I maintain an archive." Marguerite moved toward a back room. "Correspondence, receipts, manuscripts awaiting printing. You are welcome to examine them."

"I may take you up on that offer." Jean tucked the pamphlets into his leather case. "Though I suspect I will find in them the same contradictions I have found everywhere else."

"Quite possibly." Marguerite paused in the doorway to the back room, and for a moment the light from the window caught her face at an angle that rendered her expression unreadable—shadowed, watchful, as if she were measuring Jean with the same careful skepticism she applied to everything else.

Then she smiled—a small, knowing expression—and said, "The question then becomes what you do with contradictions that cannot be resolved. Do you force a resolution? Or do you accept that some things remain genuinely uncertain?"

Jean left the shop with his mind turning over her words like a coin examined for weight and wear. The philosophical skepticism was not foreign to him. He had read Montaigne. He had questioned the reliability of testimony since his first investigation.

But Marguerite Viret had articulated the endpoint of that skepticism with a clarity that felt both liberating and dangerous. If you cannot verify, you cannot conclude. If witnesses contradict without resolution, perhaps the honest report is to say: I do not know.

It was only later, as Jean walked back toward his inn through streets turned gray with evening, that he remembered the moment when Marguerite had paused in the doorway. The strange stillness of her expression. The sense that she was watching him with something more than professional courtesy or intellectual curiosity.

He glanced back toward the print shop. An upper window showed a candle's glow. A silhouette stood there—still, observant, patient as stone.

Jean shook off the impression. Widows kept vigil. Printers worked late. There was nothing uncanny in a woman standing at her own window.

But the image stayed with him as he climbed the stairs to his room: Marguerite Viret in the candlelight, watching with eyes that seemed to look through him to something beyond.

He set the pamphlets on his desk and tried to focus on the investigation. But her question returned, insistent as a psalm:

What do you do with contradictions that cannot be resolved?

And beneath it, the more dangerous question she had planted:

What if honesty means admitting you cannot know?


Jean returned to Marguerite's print shop three days after the ambush. His ribs had settled from sharp pain to dull ache, and his shoulder moved with only occasional reminders of torn tissue. The bruises would fade. The questions would not.

Marguerite received him in the same back room where she kept her archives—correspondence, manuscripts, documents that had passed through the shop over the years of her husband's operation and her own continuation of the trade. She gestured to a table stacked with folders.

"I have pulled what I could find relating to de Ségur's communications. You may examine them at your leisure."

The letters were unremarkable. Commissions for printing work. Requests for specific pamphlets. Correspondence with other moderates in Bordeaux and Paris, discussing terms of potential peace negotiations in the careful language of men who knew their words might be intercepted.

Jean was halfway through the third folder when he found it.

The letter was dated two weeks before de Ségur's death. The hand was educated but unfamiliar. The signature was illegible—deliberately so, Jean thought, examining the flourish that obscured any clear identification. The content was not obscure.

> Brother Henri,
>
> Your persistence in these negotiations betrays not only your judgment but our cause. The Crown offers us terms that amount to submission dressed in diplomatic language. You know this. Yet you persist in treating with them as if royal promises held weight beyond the parchment they soil.
>
> The commanders have taken notice. There is talk—I will be plain—of removing obstacles to clarity. You have become such an obstacle. I write not as threat but as warning from one who has served with you and who would see you withdraw from this course before withdrawal becomes impossible.
>
> Consider carefully whether peace at any price is worth the price of your continued presence among us.

Jean read it twice. Then a third time, touching his fingers in sequence as if counting the implications might reduce them to manageable number.

If the letter was genuine, it established Protestant conspiracy. It proved de Ségur had been killed by his own faction for the crime of seeking peace. The Catholic merchant's testimony about Protestant riders would be vindicated. The Protestant farmer's claims about Catholic soldiers would be revealed as faction loyalty rather than observation.

If the letter was genuine.

Jean held it to the light. The paper was period-appropriate—the kind used for private correspondence throughout Guyenne. The ink had aged with the proper fading. The fold marks suggested it had been sealed and carried.

But.

The signature was illegible. The provenance was uncertain—Marguerite claimed it had been in a bundle of papers de Ségur had left with her for safekeeping, but she could not verify when or how it had arrived among the other documents. The content was convenient—too convenient, perhaps, for a letter that so neatly resolved the question of motivation.

Jean set the letter down and looked at Marguerite. "When did you find this?"

"Yesterday, while preparing the archives for your examination. It was misfiled among other correspondence." Her voice was steady, her face composed. "I nearly missed it."

Nearly. Jean touched his middle finger to his thumb. "And you are certain de Ségur left these papers with you?"

"I am certain he left papers. I cannot swear to having examined each one when he deposited them. We handle many documents in this trade, Monsieur. Not all receive equal scrutiny."

The answer was reasonable. It was also useless for purposes of verification.

Jean returned his attention to the letter. The writer referred to "the commanders"—Protestant military leadership. He claimed to have "served with" de Ségur—suggesting military history together. These were details that could be checked. If Protestant commanders had indeed discussed removing de Ségur, there might be other evidence. Other letters. Witnesses who had heard such talk.

Or the letter could be a forgery, manufactured by Catholic interests to implicate Protestant leadership in fratricidal murder. The perfect document to appear at the perfect moment in an investigation stalled by contradictory testimony.

"May I take this?" Jean asked.

"It is evidence in a Parlement investigation." Marguerite's gesture was permissive. "I assume you have authority to claim it."

Jean folded the letter carefully and placed it in his case alongside the pamphlets. The paper felt heavier than its weight—laden with implication that might be truth or might be the most skillful lie he had yet encountered.

---

Captain Arnaud de Castelnau received Jean in a commandeered manor house that served as Protestant headquarters for the region. The Captain was a man in his fifties, weathered by campaign and diplomacy in equal measure. His courtesy was genuine. So was the sword that rested within easy reach throughout their conversation.

"You wished to discuss your progress, Monsieur de Langon?"

Jean had prepared careful language. "I seek to verify certain details regarding relationships within Protestant command structure. Specifically, whether Henri de Ségur's negotiations with the Crown met with universal approval among Protestant leadership."

De Castelnau's expression did not change. "Henri was a friend. His death was a loss to our cause."

"That is not an answer to my question, Captain."

"No," de Castelnau agreed. "It is not." He leaned back in his chair, his hand still near the sword. "There were men who disagreed with Henri's approach. There are always men who prefer war to compromise. This is not evidence of murder."

"I did not claim it was." Jean touched his fingers carefully, keeping the gesture small. "I merely seek to understand the context of his death."

"The context is that Catholics murdered a Protestant moderate to prevent peace. This is not complicated, Monsieur."

"And yet I have testimony suggesting other possibilities."

"You have testimony suggesting whatever factions wish you to hear." De Castelnau's voice held an edge now, sharp enough to draw blood if Jean pressed too hard. "Tell me—when you submit your report, will you include speculation about Protestant fratricide? Or will you report what the evidence clearly shows: Catholic assassination of a man whose only crime was seeking peace?"

The question was both threat and test. Jean felt it settle into the space between them like a blade laid on a table—not drawn, but visible.

"I will report what I can verify," Jean said.

"How admirable." The Captain's smile did not reach his eyes. "And if what you can verify serves Catholic interests? What then of your neutrality?"

Jean stood. His shoulder ached, and his ribs reminded him that neutrality had already been tested on the road through oak forest. "I serve the Parlement, Captain. Not the factions."

"The Parlement is factional, whether it admits it or not. As are you, whether you admit it or not." De Castelnau rose as well—a gesture of courtesy that framed dismissal. "I suggest, Monsieur de Langon, that you consider carefully what findings your investigation produces. Protestant patience is not infinite. Neither is Protestant memory."

Jean left the manor with the letter still in his case and the Captain's warning ringing in his ears like a bell tolling accusation.

---

He returned to his inn as evening fell. The letter lay on his desk like a piece of ordnance that might explode regardless of how carefully he handled it.

If he included it in his report, he determined the investigation's outcome. Protestant conspiracy. Internal murder. The Catholic merchant vindicated, the Protestant farmer revealed as partisan rather than witness.

If he excluded it, he suppressed potential evidence. Withheld information that might be crucial. Allowed his own doubt about the letter's authenticity to override his duty to present all findings.

If the letter was genuine, excluding it would be dishonest.

If the letter was forged, including it would be complicity in deception.

And he could not determine which it was.

Jean touched his fingers in sequence. Thumb to index. Index to middle. Middle to ring. Ring to small. A complete circuit of counting that produced no certainty, only the recognition that certainty was not available.

The honest course seemed clear: investigate further. Seek additional evidence about Protestant command discussions. Interview more witnesses. Delay the report until verification was possible.

But the magistrate's deadline was one week away. Captain de Castelnau's warning was fresh. And somewhere in Bordeaux, other forces were watching, waiting to see what Jean's investigation would produce.

He could not know if the letter was genuine.

Any action he took regarding it—include, exclude, or continue investigating—required him to act despite that uncertainty.

This, Jean realized, was the trap. Not the specific question of one document's authenticity, but the larger question Marguerite had asked: What do you do when you cannot verify? When testimony contradicts? When evidence might be genuine or might be forgery?

Do you force a conclusion? Or do you admit uncertainty and refuse to conclude?

Jean stared at the letter until the candle burned low and his eyes ached from reading the same words over and over, searching for some detail that would reveal truth beneath the careful script.

The words did not change. The signature remained illegible. The provenance stayed unverifiable.

And the deadline drew closer with every passing hour.

Jean finally set the letter aside and tried to sleep. But even in darkness, the question followed him:

If I cannot verify, can I conclude?

And if I cannot conclude, what am I doing here at all?


The ball was held at the residence of Antoine de Pibrac, a nobleman whose wealth derived from wine and whose survival derived from hosting gatherings where both factions could meet under the fiction of social courtesy. Jean arrived as evening settled into full dark, his best doublet brushed clean and his sword worn as much for fashion as function. A man did not attend such events unarmed. Neither did he draw steel unless he wished never to be invited again.

The great hall glittered with candles that cost more than most families spent on food in a season. Musicians played in the gallery. Guests moved in patterns of approach and avoidance choreographed by faction loyalty and social rank. Jean recognized faces from both sides: Catholic League supporters in one cluster, Protestant commanders in another, and between them the politiques who attempted to serve neither faction enough to provoke the other.

He had barely crossed the threshold when Father Michel Sorbin appeared at his elbow.

"Monsieur de Langon. I had hoped we might encounter each other this evening." The priest was perhaps fifty, dressed in the fine black of the clergy but with a bearing that suggested military service in his past. His Latin was impeccable, Jean knew. So was his swordwork.

"Father Sorbin." Jean inclined his head with the precise degree of courtesy owed to a representative of the Church who also served as an agent of Catholic interests. "You honor me with your attention."

"Hardly honor. Merely curiosity." Sorbin's smile was urbane, almost warm, in the way of men who had learned to make courtesy itself a weapon. "The Parlement's investigation proceeds, I trust?"

"It proceeds."

"Slowly, I observe. One might wonder what delays your conclusions."

Jean touched his thumb to his index finger—a small gesture, nearly invisible in the social movement around them. "Thoroughness delays me, Father. The testimony is complex."

"Complex." Sorbin's tone made the word a gentle mockery. "An interesting characterization for what seems rather straightforward. A Protestant notable murdered on a road controlled by Protestant forces, with Catholic soldiers conveniently blamed. One would think the truth rather evident."

"Evidence and truth are not always identical, Father."

"No? How philosophical." Sorbin accepted wine from a passing servant and sipped with appreciation before continuing. "Though I suppose a man educated at the Collège de Guyenne would find epistemological complications where simpler minds see merely facts. Tell me—does your investigation consider the letter?"

Jean's hand stilled on his doublet. "What letter would that be?"

"Come, Monsieur. You have been to see the printer's widow. Documents pass through her establishment as freely as gossip through a marketplace. If there exists evidence of Protestant conspiracy, surely you have encountered it?"

The priest's knowledge was too specific to be speculation. Someone had reported Jean's visit to Marguerite's shop. Someone had known about the letter, or guessed its existence, or manufactured it entirely and now sought to confirm Jean had taken the bait.

"I have encountered many documents," Jean said carefully. "Each requires verification before it can be properly weighted as evidence."

"Verification." Sorbin's smile never wavered. "One imagines verification might prove difficult when the witness is dead and the author unsigned. Perhaps, in such cases, one must rely on judgment rather than perfect certainty. The judgment, for instance, that Protestant commanders had motive to remove an obstacle to their preferred course of war."

"Or the judgment that Catholic interests would benefit from such a letter's existence, whether genuine or manufactured."

"Precisely." The priest's eyes gleamed with something like approval. "You see the difficulty. Each faction has motive to create false evidence. Each accusation serves someone's interest. In such a situation, how does an honest investigator determine truth?"

It was the same question Marguerite had posed, but from Sorbin it carried different weight. The philosopher asked to paralyze. The priest asked to test whether Jean could be turned.

"An honest investigator," Jean said slowly, "reports what he can verify and acknowledges what he cannot. He does not manufacture certainty to satisfy those who demand conclusions."

"How admirable." Sorbin set down his wine glass with deliberate care. "And how dangerous. Men who refuse to choose sides often discover they have made themselves the enemy of both. I do hope, Monsieur, that your thoroughness does not become your epitaph."

The priest moved away into the crowd, his warning delivered with the same urbane courtesy he brought to every interaction. Jean watched him go and felt his ribs ache where the ambush-fighter's dagger had struck leather instead of flesh.

---

Across the room, Jean saw Captain de Castelnau in conversation with a group of Protestant officers. The Captain's gaze met his briefly—an acknowledgment of presence that carried neither invitation nor threat. Simply a reminder that Protestant interests watched as carefully as Catholic.

Jean moved toward the refreshment tables, seeking space to breathe and think. He had barely reached the wine when a woman's voice spoke at his shoulder.

"You look like a man surrounded by enemies, Monsieur de Langon."

Jean turned. The speaker was Marie de Gramont, a Catholic noblewoman whose husband commanded League forces in the region. She was perhaps forty-five, dressed in silk that proclaimed wealth without ostentation. Her smile was pleasant. Her reputation was for ruthlessness in defense of family interests.

"I am an investigator, Madame. I have no enemies, only subjects of inquiry."

"How diplomatic. And how untrue." She accepted wine from a servant and sipped delicately. "I was present when you were attacked on the road. Not physically, you understand. But I heard of it. Three men—or was it four?—who failed to complete their commission."

"You are well-informed."

"I employ people who keep me well-informed. It is how one survives when one's family holds lands both factions covet." Her eyes—dark, intelligent, evaluating—studied him with the same care Jean brought to witness testimony. "Tell me, Monsieur. When you discover who commissioned that attack, will you include it in your report?"

"If I discover it, and can verify the source, yes."

"Even if the source proves inconvenient to your conclusions about de Ségur's death?"

Jean felt the trap in the question but could not identify its mechanism. "Evidence is evidence, Madame. I do not discard findings because they complicate my narrative."

"Then you are more honest than most investigators." Marie de Gramont's smile deepened. "Or more naive. The attack on your life and the murder of Henri de Ségur might well be connected. Both events serve someone's interests. The question is whose."

She moved away before Jean could respond, leaving him with wine he no longer wanted and a new layer of complexity he had not requested.

---

The evening ground onward through courses of food and rounds of conversation. Jean navigated the hall like a man crossing a battlefield, aware that every exchange held potential for detonation.

A Catholic merchant asked pointed questions about his timeline. A Protestant officer inquired about his lodgings with concern that sounded like threat. A politique magistrate suggested neutrality might best be served by inconclusive findings that satisfied no one and thus offended no one fatally.

Jean responded to each with careful courtesy and said nothing of substance to anyone. He revealed no conclusions because he had none. He committed to no faction because commitment was the one luxury an investigator could not afford.

But as the evening wore on, Jean began to understand what he had not seen before: his neutrality was being read as position by everyone who encountered it.

The Catholics assumed his caution meant he had found evidence of Protestant guilt but feared to state it directly. They treated him with the careful courtesy reserved for allies who might yet prove useful.

The Protestants assumed his thoroughness meant he was building a case for Catholic conspiracy but needed more evidence to make it undeniable. They watched him with the wary respect due to someone whose final report might vindicate their narrative.

The politiques assumed his inconclusiveness was deliberate strategy—a man who had learned, as they had learned, that the only safe position in Guyenne was the refusal to take any position at all.

All of them were wrong. Or perhaps all of them were right. Jean's neutrality had become a mirror in which every faction saw its own assumptions reflected.

He touched his fingers in sequence—thumb to index, index to middle, middle to ring, ring to small finger—and realized the gesture itself had become performance. The careful investigator weighing evidence. The neutral arbiter considering all sides.

But what if there was no weight to measure? What if the evidence could not be weighed because verification was impossible?

Jean set down his wine glass and moved toward the exit. The ball continued around him—conversation, music, the elaborate dance of faction politics dressed in social forms. He had learned nothing tonight. Or perhaps he had learned everything that mattered: that his investigation was not about finding truth but about producing a report that someone would use as weapon.

Outside, the night air was cool against his face. Jean stood in the courtyard and let the sounds of the ball fade behind him. Above, stars showed clear between clouds. Below, Bordeaux slept uneasily, poised between peace and war, waiting for Jean's report to tip the balance one way or another.

He had perhaps four days remaining before de Lacaze required submission. Four days to determine truth from the wreckage of contradictory testimony and unverifiable documents.

Four days to decide whether honest uncertainty was wisdom or cowardice.

Jean touched his fingers one more time and felt the gesture empty of meaning. He was not weighing evidence. He was counting the days until he would have to choose between truth he could not verify and conclusions he could not honestly claim.

The ball glittered behind him. The road stretched dark ahead. And Jean de Langon stood between them, neutral, thorough, and utterly alone.


Jean returned to the print shop well after dark. The streets of Bordeaux were dangerous at this hour, but danger had become a constant companion, and Jean no longer weighed the risks of movement against the risks of stillness. Both would kill him if he miscalculated.

Marguerite answered his knock herself. She held a candle that carved her face into planes of light and shadow, and for a moment Jean saw something in her expression that seemed older than the face that wore it—a weariness beyond years, a patience that suggested time moved differently for her than for other people.

Then she stepped back and the impression dissolved into ordinary welcome. "Monsieur de Langon. This is an irregular hour for a visit."

"I apologize. But I find myself in need of...conversation." Jean heard the admission in his own voice and did not try to hide it. "If you will permit it."

She studied him for a moment, then nodded and opened the door wider. "Come. I was working late myself. One more interruption will not ruin what is already ruined by exhaustion."

The back room where she kept her archives was lit by three candles. Papers covered the compositor's desk—manuscripts, Jean saw, that Marguerite was setting into type. The work of a printer who kept no apprentices and therefore did all labors herself, from composition to press to binding.

Jean set his leather case on a clear corner of desk. The letter lay inside it, still unresolved. The deadline lay three days ahead, still approaching. And Jean felt the weight of both press against his chest like the dagger that had failed to pierce his jack on the forest road.

"You look," Marguerite said quietly, "like a man who has discovered that the tools of his profession do not reach the truth they were meant to grasp."

Jean almost laughed. "You have a gift for diagnosis, Madame."

"I have read Montaigne. One recognizes the symptoms of epistemological crisis." She moved to a small table and poured two cups of wine. "Tell me what has driven you to seek philosophical counsel at an hour when most men seek only their beds."

Jean accepted the wine but did not drink. Instead he drew out the letter and set it on the desk between them. "This document suggests Protestant conspiracy. If it is genuine, it resolves my investigation. If it is forged, it is the most skillful lie I have encountered."

Marguerite picked up the letter and read it with the careful attention of someone accustomed to evaluating text. When she finished, she set it down and met Jean's eyes. "And you cannot determine which it is."

"I cannot."

"What have you done to verify it?"

"I have compared the hand against other samples from Protestant correspondence—inconclusive. I have examined the paper and ink—period-appropriate but not unique. I have interviewed witnesses who might confirm discussions of removing de Ségur—but their testimony is compromised by faction loyalty. Every path toward verification leads back to the same problem: I cannot know."

Marguerite sipped her wine. The candlelight caught her face at an angle that made her eyes seem deeper than they should be, as if she were looking at Jean from very far away. "Then perhaps the question is not whether you can verify, but what you do when verification is impossible."

"I must submit a report in three days."

"Must you? What if you submitted nothing?" Her voice was gentle, almost sympathetic. "What if you returned to the magistrate and said: the evidence is insufficient, the testimony contradictory, the truth inaccessible. I cannot in honesty conclude."

Jean set down his wine cup. "That is surrender."

"Is it? Or is it the only honest response to a situation that permits no honest conclusion?" Marguerite leaned forward slightly. "Consider: if you include the letter, you may be perpetuating a forgery. If you exclude it, you may be suppressing evidence. If you conclude Catholic guilt, you may be condemning innocent men. If you conclude Protestant conspiracy, you may be serving Catholic propaganda."

"So I conclude nothing."

"So you admit that some questions cannot be answered with the evidence available. That is not failure, Monsieur. That is intellectual honesty."

The argument was seductive. Jean felt it slide beneath his professional identity like water finding the cracks in a foundation. He had thought this himself, had he not? That honest doubt might be wiser than false certainty?

"The magistrate demands conclusions," Jean said. "Peace in Guyenne depends on my report providing clarity."

"Then the magistrate demands what cannot be honestly given." Marguerite's tone was patient, relentless. "You cannot manufacture certainty from insufficient evidence. To force a conclusion despite uncertainty is not investigation—it is fiction dressed as fact."

"But inaction has consequences. If I submit no report, both factions will claim I failed them. The Catholic League will see Protestant protection. The Protestant commanders will see Catholic bias. My neutrality serves no one."

"Your neutrality serves truth." Marguerite rose and moved to the window. Outside, Bordeaux lay dark beneath a sky empty of stars. "Or rather, it serves the acknowledgment that truth cannot always be grasped. That sometimes the most honest statement is: I do not know."

Jean touched his fingers in sequence. Thumb to index. Index to middle. The gesture brought no comfort, no measurement, no weight that could be counted.

"You are asking me to abandon my duty."

"I am asking you to recognize that your duty might be to report honestly on what you failed to determine, rather than to pretend determination where none exists." She turned from the window. The candlelight made her face a mask of shadow and illumination. "You have been trained to produce conclusions. But what if the conclusion is that no conclusion is possible? Is that not itself a kind of truth?"

Jean stared at the letter on the desk. Protestant conspiracy or Catholic forgery. Genuine evidence or skillful deception. Three days to decide, and no tool of investigation that could distinguish one from the other.

"If I submit nothing," he said slowly, "I protect no one. The Catholics will blame Protestant murder. The Protestants will blame Catholic assassination. War comes regardless."

"War may come regardless of what you submit." Marguerite's voice was soft, almost kind. "That is the tragedy of your situation, Monsieur. You cannot prevent the consequences of their certainty with your uncertainty. But you can refuse to add your voice to their false certainties. You can stand apart and say: I will not claim to know what I do not know."

The argument was clean. Philosophical. It matched everything Jean had believed about the virtue of skepticism, the wisdom of withholding judgment, the integrity of admitting limits.

It was also, Jean realized with sudden clarity, a trap.

Not a trap of logic. The logic was sound. Marguerite's argument was genuinely compelling, built on principles Jean himself held. If you cannot verify, you cannot conclude. If evidence is insufficient, forcing conclusions is dishonest.

But.

"You offer me purity," Jean said quietly. "The purity of never claiming more than I can prove. The safety of perpetual suspension of judgment."

"I offer you honesty."

"No." Jean shook his head. "You offer me a fortress. The same fortress I have inhabited my entire career. The belief that uncertainty absolves me of responsibility for action."

Marguerite's expression did not change, but something in her stillness suggested Jean had surprised her. "Responsibility for what action?"

"For reporting what I observed, even if I cannot verify it completely. For stating which interpretations seem more plausible, even if I cannot prove them conclusively. For accepting that action under uncertainty is still action—still truthful—if I honestly represent the limits of what I know."

Jean stood and gathered the letter back into his case. His hands were steady now, his voice certain in a way it had not been since the investigation began.

"You are right that I cannot manufacture certainty," he continued. "But I can honestly describe what I found, acknowledge what I could not verify, and let others judge whether my incomplete findings serve truth better than my complete silence."

"And if you are wrong? If the letter is forged and you include it? If innocent men die because you acted under uncertainty?"

"Then I will have acted honestly about what I did not know, rather than refusing to act because I could not know everything." Jean met her eyes. "That is not the same as manufacturing false certainty. It is accepting that truthfulness does not require omniscience."

For a long moment, Marguerite said nothing. She stood at the window with the darkness behind her and the candlelight failing to fully illuminate her face. Jean could not read her expression. Could not determine whether she was disappointed or something else.

Then she smiled—a small, almost sad expression. "You surprise me, Monsieur de Langon. I had thought the argument conclusive."

"It was conclusive. It was also incomplete." Jean moved toward the door. "I thank you for the conversation, Madame. It has clarified my thinking remarkably."

"Has it?" Her voice followed him. "Or has it merely given you permission to do what you already intended?"

Jean paused in the doorway. "Perhaps both. Perhaps neither. I find I have become comfortable with uncertainty about my own motives."

He left the print shop and walked back through dark streets toward his inn. The letter remained in his case. The deadline remained three days away. But something had shifted—not in the evidence, but in Jean himself.

He could not verify the letter. Could not resolve the contradictions in testimony. Could not determine with certainty who had killed Henri de Ségur or why.

But he could write an honest account of what he had observed, what he had failed to verify, and what possibilities remained unresolved. He could submit uncertainty as finding rather than refusing to submit at all.

The difference was small. Perhaps too small to matter in the factional warfare that would follow regardless of what he reported.

But it was his. And it was true.

Jean touched his fingers one final time and felt the gesture settle into something other than fortress. Not measurement of certainty. Just recognition that some questions could be honestly answered with "I do not know"—and that answering them that way was itself a form of action.

Behind him, a light still burned in the print shop's upper window. A silhouette stood there, watchful and still.

Jean did not look back. He had a report to write.


Jean sat at his desk as dawn broke over Bordeaux. The candle had burned down to a stub. His hand ached from hours of writing. Before him lay the report—ten pages of careful script, an accounting that would satisfy no one and might condemn him.

He read it through one final time.

> To Bernard de Lacaze, Magistrate of the Parlement of Bordeaux:
>
> I submit herewith my findings regarding the death of Henri de Ségur, Protestant notable, discovered deceased on the road between Bordeaux and Saint-Émilion on the 14th day of September, 1588.
>
> **Testimony Gathered:**
>
> I have interviewed three primary witnesses. Martin Dufour, Catholic merchant, reports observing riders in Protestant livery departing the area after the approximate time of death. His testimony is internally consistent but relies on identification of faction markers at distance and after learning of the murder, which may have influenced his recollection.
>
> Arnaud Besse, Protestant farmer, reports observing armed men near the site before dawn on the day of the murder. He identifies them as Catholic League soldiers based on their bearing and his knowledge of Catholic movements through his lands. I could not verify specific insignia or commission.
>
> Lisette, servant at the estate where de Ségur lodged the night before his death, reports overhearing an argument between de Ségur and another Protestant gentleman regarding negotiations with the Crown. She did not observe the second man and cannot identify him. Her account suggests possible factional conflict within Protestant leadership but cannot be corroborated.
>
> **Physical Evidence:**
>
> The site of death shows signs of ambush but no specific markers of faction identity. De Ségur died from sword wounds consistent with multiple attackers. The body was discovered by local farmers and removed before I could examine it in situ.
>
> **Documentary Evidence:**
>
> I have obtained a letter, allegedly from Protestant correspondence, suggesting commanders had discussed removing de Ségur as an obstacle to their preferred course of action. The letter's provenance cannot be fully verified. The signature is illegible. The content is consistent with motive but could equally serve as manufactured evidence to implicate Protestant leadership.
>
> **Analysis:**
>
> The testimony is irreconcilable. If the Catholic merchant's account is accurate, Protestant forces killed de Ségur. If the Protestant farmer's account is accurate, Catholic forces are responsible. If the servant's account is accurate, the murder may have been internal to Protestant leadership.
>
> Each witness believes their testimony. None can be definitively proven false. Cross-examination reveals no clear deception but also no path to resolution.
>
> The letter, if genuine, strongly suggests Protestant conspiracy. If forged, it represents sophisticated Catholic propaganda. I have found no conclusive method to determine authenticity.
>
> **Conclusion:**
>
> I cannot determine with certainty who killed Henri de Ségur or under whose authority the killing was commissioned. The evidence permits multiple interpretations. Catholic assassination, Protestant fratricide, and banditry all remain possible based on available testimony.
>
> I can honestly report what I observed: contradictory witness accounts, unverifiable documentary evidence, and physical findings consistent with ambush but not with specific faction identification.
>
> I cannot honestly report a conclusion about who bears responsibility. To do so would require claiming certainty I do not possess or manufacturing findings to serve factional interests rather than truth.
>
> I submit this report acknowledging its incompleteness, with the recognition that honest investigation sometimes produces uncertainty rather than resolution.
>
> Respectfully submitted,
> Jean de Langon
> Agent of the Parlement of Bordeaux
> 20th day of September, 1588

Jean set down the final page and touched his fingers in sequence. Not counting, not measuring. Simply the gesture itself—a recognition marker that meant nothing except that he was who he had always been, even as everything had changed.

The report was professional suicide. De Lacaze would understand that immediately. So would anyone who read it.

Jean had not concluded Catholic guilt, which would enrage Protestant commanders. He had not concluded Protestant conspiracy, which would provoke Catholic League reprisal. He had not even concluded that determination was impossible in a way that preserved his neutrality—he had simply stated what he found and what he failed to find, with no attempt to protect either faction's narrative or his own reputation.

The Catholics would see Protestant protection. The Protestants would see Catholic bias. The politiques would see incompetence. All of them would be wrong, but none of them would care.

Jean sealed the report and stood. His shoulder ached from the hours of sitting. His eyes burned from candlelight and lack of sleep. But his hands were steady as he gathered the document into his leather case.

Outside, Bordeaux was waking. Church bells rang for morning prayer. Market vendors began their calls. The city moved into another day of uneasy peace, not knowing that Jean's report might tip the balance toward war.

Or might not. Perhaps it would change nothing. Perhaps both factions had already decided their conclusions and would simply ignore findings that failed to serve their purposes.

Jean walked through streets turned gold with sunrise toward the magistrate's residence. The letter of passage still rested in his pocket—protection that had proven illusory on the forest road and would prove equally useless against the consequences of an honest report.

But he was done with fortresses. Done with the belief that neutrality meant safety or that withholding judgment meant wisdom. Uncertainty was real. Verification was often impossible. And truthful action did not require omniscience—only honest acknowledgment of limits.

---

Bernard de Lacaze received him in the same chambers where the investigation had begun. The magistrate looked older than he had two weeks prior, as if the weight of maintaining order in Guyenne had compressed his remaining years into visible form.

Jean placed the report on the desk between them.

De Lacaze read in silence. Jean watched the older man's face and saw the recognition settle: this report protected nothing, concluded nothing, satisfied no one.

When de Lacaze finally looked up, his expression was careful. "You understand what this means."

"I understand that it is honest."

"Honesty." The magistrate's voice was dry. "A luxury we can rarely afford."

"Perhaps. But it is what I have to offer." Jean met de Lacaze's eyes. "I could have forced a conclusion. I chose instead to report truthfully on what I could not determine."

"The Parlement will not accept this."

"I know."

"Captain de Castelnau will see it as evidence you suppressed findings of Catholic guilt."

"I know."

"Father Sorbin will claim you protected Protestant conspirators."

"I know." Jean touched his fingers briefly—thumb to index, a half-gesture. "But I know something else as well: any other report would have been a lie. Perhaps a useful lie. Perhaps a lie that served peace or justice or someone's version of order. But a lie nonetheless."

De Lacaze was quiet for a long moment. Then he sighed—a sound of exhaustion that went bone-deep. "You are a better man than this province deserves, Jean de Langon. I hope that brings you comfort when both sides come for you."

"It will not." Jean stood. "But it is mine. And it is true."

He left the magistrate's chambers and descended into a Bordeaux morning that smelled of bread baking and the river. Somewhere in this city, Father Sorbin was receiving word of Jean's report. Somewhere else, Captain de Castelnau was learning that the investigation had concluded nothing useful to Protestant interests.

Jean had perhaps a day before both factions moved against him. Perhaps less. Men who refused to serve anyone's narrative were more dangerous than men who served the wrong side.

He returned to his inn and began packing. His belongings were few—a traveler's life, an investigator's necessities. He would leave Bordeaux tonight. Perhaps reach another jurisdiction before the warrants were issued. Perhaps find magistrates who valued honest uncertainty over useful conclusions.

Or perhaps not. Perhaps the next ambush would succeed where the first had failed. Perhaps Father Sorbin's urbane courtesy or Captain de Castelnau's honorable warning would give way to blades in the dark.

Jean touched his fingers one last time and felt the gesture settle into something that was neither fortress nor measurement. Simply an acknowledgment: I did what I could honestly do. I said what I could honestly say. The consequences are not mine to control.

The report lay on de Lacaze's desk. Jean's fate lay somewhere ahead on the roads of Guyenne. And between them stretched the small space where a man had chosen truthfulness under uncertainty over the safety of manufactured certainty.

It was not much. Perhaps not enough.

But it was true.

Jean shouldered his bag and walked out of the inn into the morning light. The road waited. So did whatever came next.

He was ready for both.


Jean left Bordeaux at dusk. The gate guards examined his papers with the careful attention of men who knew warrants might follow any traveler, but his letter of passage from the Parlement was still valid—would remain valid until someone with authority revoked it. By then, Jean intended to be across the provincial boundary into territory where Guyenne's factional feuds held less immediate weight.

His horse was the same animal that had carried him through the investigation. Steady, not fast. The kind of mount that served for travel rather than escape. Jean had considered acquiring a faster horse, then rejected the idea. He was not fleeing. He was moving toward whatever came next with the same methodical certainty he brought to everything else.

The road stretched west toward the coast. If he could reach La Rochelle, the Protestant stronghold might offer temporary sanctuary. Or it might not—his report had satisfied neither faction, which meant he was enemy to both. But La Rochelle was possibility, and Bordeaux had become certainty of a lethal kind.

The first hour passed in silence broken only by his horse's hoofbeats and the evening calls of birds settling into roost. Jean rode with his hand near his sword and his attention spread across the landscape. Oak forest to the left, open farmland to the right, and ahead the road narrowing into country where faction control gave way to the older law of isolated men with weapons.

He did not see them until they stepped onto the road.

Six riders. Three from the forest to his left, three from a farmhouse to his right. The coordination spoke of planning rather than opportunistic banditry. They blocked the road ahead and Jean heard hoofbeats behind—more riders closing the trap.

Jean reined his horse to a halt. His shoulder began its familiar ache, the old wound's prophecy of violence to come. He recognized none of the riders' faces, but their equipment told him enough: professional soldiers, not bandits. Men who followed orders and expected payment.

"Jean de Langon." The speaker was a lean man perhaps forty years old, mounted on a horse too fine for common service. "Your presence is no longer required on these roads."

"By whose authority?" Jean kept his voice level, professional. One hand on the reins, the other resting near his sword.

"Does it matter?" The man's smile held no humor. "Your report pleased neither the Captain nor the Father. Both concluded you had outlived your usefulness. We are...a collaborative enterprise."

Catholic and Protestant, working together. United only in their need to punish the man who had refused to serve either faction's narrative. Jean felt a bitter satisfaction at the confirmation: his neutrality had succeeded so well that both sides recognized him as enemy.

"The Parlement—" Jean began.

"Sends its regrets." The lean man drew his sword. "You will not be the first investigator to die on these roads. Bandits are everywhere in Guyenne. The magistrate will understand."

The attack came from three sides at once.

Jean spurred his horse forward—not toward escape but toward the narrowest gap in the riders ahead. If he could break through, if the road opened enough to give him space to run—

His horse screamed and went down. Someone had hamstrung it as Jean charged. He felt the animal collapse beneath him and threw himself clear, hitting the ground hard on his bad shoulder. The old wound tore. Pain blazed through his left arm like fire through dry tinder.

Jean rolled and came up with his sword drawn. Three men dismounted and came at him on foot. Professional work—they did not rush, did not give him the advantage of their impatience. They simply closed in with the patience of men who knew the outcome.

The first man swung high. Jean parried but his left arm would not fully extend—the shoulder screamed and gave and nearly dropped his guard. He twisted away from the second man's thrust and cut low, feeling his blade bite into thigh. The man went down.

But the others were already moving. A sword came for his ribs. Jean parried with his dagger and felt the shock of impact jar his injured shoulder. His left arm was useless now—he could barely hold the dagger, could not parry effectively. His right hand did all the work and it was not enough.

The lean commander had dismounted and now joined the fight. Four men circling one. Jean backed against the body of his dying horse, using the animal for cover, conserving strength he did not have for a fight he could not win.

"Make it quick," Jean said. His breath came hard. Blood ran down his left arm where the shoulder wound had torn fully open. "I ask that courtesy."

"You ask for more than you gave us." The commander's voice was almost regretful. "Your report gave us nothing but complications. We give you the same in return."

They came at him together.

Jean fought. Not well—his shoulder betrayed him, his left arm hung useless, and the four men were skilled enough to coordinate their strikes. But he fought because fighting was what remained. He cut one man across the arm. Drove his pommel into another's face. Made them work for it.

It was not enough.

A sword took him in the side, punching through his jack to scrape along ribs. Jean twisted away and felt his legs give. He went down into the dirt of the road, his sword falling from nerveless fingers as shock and blood loss did what four armed men had struggled to accomplish.

The lean commander stood over him. His blade rested against Jean's throat—not cutting, not yet. Simply there as promise.

"Any final words? A message for the magistrate?"

Jean looked up at the darkening sky. Stars were beginning to show between clouds. Beautiful, he thought distantly. He had not noticed them often enough during the investigation. Too focused on testimony and documents to observe the simple fact of evening light.

"Tell him," Jean said, and his voice was steady despite the blood soaking through his doublet, "that I told the truth about what I didn't know. That was mine to give."

"The truth." The commander's laugh was bitter. "The truth got you killed, investigator. I hope it was worth the price."

Jean closed his eyes. "It was true. That is worth something."

The blade moved. Jean felt pressure, then warmth, then the strange sensation of his breath escaping from the wrong place. His body understood before his mind did: the cutting was done. What remained was simply the time it took for understanding to fade.

Not long now.

Jean lay in the dirt and felt his life drain into the road he had traveled so carefully, investigating a murder he could not solve with tools that could not reach the truth they were meant to grasp.

He had failed. The investigation produced no useful conclusion. His report satisfied no one. Both factions had turned against him. Peace in Guyenne would not be served by his work.

But.

He had told the truth about what he did not know.

He had acted honestly under uncertainty rather than refusing to act because certainty was impossible.

He had submitted findings that were incomplete but true, rather than conclusions that were useful but false.

It was not much. Perhaps not enough to justify the price he was paying in blood and gasping breath.

But it was his. And it was true.

Jean's fingers twitched—thumb to index, the counting gesture for the final time. Not measuring evidence now. Simply acknowledging: this is what remained. This small honest thing in the gathering dark.

The sky above him was full dark now, stars bright and cold and beautiful. Jean watched them and felt his awareness begin to narrow. The pain was distant. The voices of the men who had killed him faded. What remained was simply the question burning in the center of his fading consciousness:

*If I can die for honest uncertainty, what can I die for with conviction?*

The question was new. Urgent. Hungry in a way Jean had never permitted himself to be hungry during life.

He had learned to act under uncertainty. To speak truthfully about limits while accepting consequences. To choose integrity over safety.

But he had never found what deserved certain commitment. What cause was worth dying for with eyes open and heart full and no doubt to shelter behind. What truth was worth not just acknowledging but proclaiming. What people were worth not just investigating but joining.

The hunger for that answer pulled at him—not backward into the life that was ending, but forward into something else. Somewhere ahead in the turning wheel. A century distant, two centuries, it did not matter. There would be a cause. A commitment that did not require pretending to know. A choice made with conviction rather than careful hedge.

Ready to believe.

Ready to commit.

Ready to die not for honest doubt but for certain purpose.

The question burned brighter than the pain, brighter than the fading stars, brighter than anything Jean had felt in forty-three years of careful neutrality.

*What is worth dying for with conviction?*

The wheel turned.

Consciousness pulled loose like thread from fabric, seeking the pattern that would answer the question Jean de Langon had finally learned to ask.

The road faded. The pain faded. The men standing over his body faded.

What remained was the hunger—pure, clean, reaching forward into darkness that held somewhere within it the shape of commitment Jean had spent a lifetime avoiding.

Ready now.

Ready to find what deserved certainty.

Ready to die for it.

The wheel turned.

---

Jean de Langon died on the road west of Bordeaux three days after submitting his report. The official finding was banditry. The magistrate accepted this conclusion because no alternative served order. Both factions claimed vindication in the investigator's death: the Catholics because he had failed to prove Protestant conspiracy, the Protestants because he had failed to exonerate Catholic assassination.

His report was filed and forgotten. Henri de Ségur's murder remained unresolved. Guyenne tumbled into another year of uneasy peace that would eventually fracture into war.

None of this mattered to the consciousness that had been Jean de Langon. It was already moving forward, already seeking the answer to the question that had ignited in his final breath.

What is worth dying for with conviction?

Somewhere ahead—in a different country, a different century—that question would find its answer.

And the wheel would turn again.
