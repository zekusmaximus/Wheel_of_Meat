Jean returned to the print shop well after dark. The streets of Bordeaux were dangerous at this hour, but danger had become a constant companion, and Jean no longer weighed the risks of movement against the risks of stillness. Both would kill him if he miscalculated.

Marguerite answered his knock herself. She held a candle that carved her face into planes of light and shadow, and for a moment Jean saw something in her expression that seemed older than the face that wore it—a weariness beyond years, a patience that suggested time moved differently for her than for other people.

Then she stepped back and the impression dissolved into ordinary welcome. "Monsieur de Langon. This is an irregular hour for a visit."

"I apologize. But I find myself in need of...conversation." Jean heard the admission in his own voice and did not try to hide it. "If you will permit it."

She studied him for a moment, then nodded and opened the door wider. "Come. I was working late myself. One more interruption will not ruin what is already ruined by exhaustion."

The back room where she kept her archives was lit by three candles. Papers covered the compositor's desk—manuscripts, Jean saw, that Marguerite was setting into type. The work of a printer who kept no apprentices and therefore did all labors herself, from composition to press to binding.

Jean set his leather case on a clear corner of desk. The letter lay inside it, still unresolved. The deadline lay three days ahead, still approaching. And Jean felt the weight of both press against his chest like the dagger that had failed to pierce his jack on the forest road.

"You look," Marguerite said quietly, "like a man who has discovered that the tools of his profession do not reach the truth they were meant to grasp."

Jean almost laughed. "You have a gift for diagnosis, Madame."

"I have read Montaigne. One recognizes the symptoms of epistemological crisis." She moved to a small table and poured two cups of wine. "Tell me what has driven you to seek philosophical counsel at an hour when most men seek only their beds."

Jean accepted the wine but did not drink. Instead he drew out the letter and set it on the desk between them. "This document suggests Protestant conspiracy. If it is genuine, it resolves my investigation. If it is forged, it is the most skillful lie I have encountered."

Marguerite picked up the letter and read it with the careful attention of someone accustomed to evaluating text. When she finished, she set it down and met Jean's eyes. "And you cannot determine which it is."

"I cannot."

"What have you done to verify it?"

"I have compared the hand against other samples from Protestant correspondence—inconclusive. I have examined the paper and ink—period-appropriate but not unique. I have interviewed witnesses who might confirm discussions of removing de Ségur—but their testimony is compromised by faction loyalty. Every path toward verification leads back to the same problem: I cannot know."

Marguerite sipped her wine. The candlelight caught her face at an angle that made her eyes seem deeper than they should be, as if she were looking at Jean from very far away. "Then perhaps the question is not whether you can verify, but what you do when verification is impossible."

"I must submit a report in three days."

"Must you? What if you submitted nothing?" Her voice was gentle, almost sympathetic. "What if you returned to the magistrate and said: the evidence is insufficient, the testimony contradictory, the truth inaccessible. I cannot in honesty conclude."

Jean set down his wine cup. "That is surrender."

"Is it? Or is it the only honest response to a situation that permits no honest conclusion?" Marguerite leaned forward slightly. "Consider: if you include the letter, you may be perpetuating a forgery. If you exclude it, you may be suppressing evidence. If you conclude Catholic guilt, you may be condemning innocent men. If you conclude Protestant conspiracy, you may be serving Catholic propaganda."

"So I conclude nothing."

"So you admit that some questions cannot be answered with the evidence available. That is not failure, Monsieur. That is intellectual honesty."

The argument was seductive. Jean felt it slide beneath his professional identity like water finding the cracks in a foundation. He had thought this himself, had he not? That honest doubt might be wiser than false certainty?

"The magistrate demands conclusions," Jean said. "Peace in Guyenne depends on my report providing clarity."

"Then the magistrate demands what cannot be honestly given." Marguerite's tone was patient, relentless. "You cannot manufacture certainty from insufficient evidence. To force a conclusion despite uncertainty is not investigation—it is fiction dressed as fact."

"But inaction has consequences. If I submit no report, both factions will claim I failed them. The Catholic League will see Protestant protection. The Protestant commanders will see Catholic bias. My neutrality serves no one."

"Your neutrality serves truth." Marguerite rose and moved to the window. Outside, Bordeaux lay dark beneath a sky empty of stars. "Or rather, it serves the acknowledgment that truth cannot always be grasped. That sometimes the most honest statement is: I do not know."

Jean touched his fingers in sequence. Thumb to index. Index to middle. The gesture brought no comfort, no measurement, no weight that could be counted.

"You are asking me to abandon my duty."

"I am asking you to recognize that your duty might be to report honestly on what you failed to determine, rather than to pretend determination where none exists." She turned from the window. The candlelight made her face a mask of shadow and illumination. "You have been trained to produce conclusions. But what if the conclusion is that no conclusion is possible? Is that not itself a kind of truth?"

Jean stared at the letter on the desk. Protestant conspiracy or Catholic forgery. Genuine evidence or skillful deception. Three days to decide, and no tool of investigation that could distinguish one from the other.

"If I submit nothing," he said slowly, "I protect no one. The Catholics will blame Protestant murder. The Protestants will blame Catholic assassination. War comes regardless."

"War may come regardless of what you submit." Marguerite's voice was soft, almost kind. "That is the tragedy of your situation, Monsieur. You cannot prevent the consequences of their certainty with your uncertainty. But you can refuse to add your voice to their false certainties. You can stand apart and say: I will not claim to know what I do not know."

The argument was clean. Philosophical. It matched everything Jean had believed about the virtue of skepticism, the wisdom of withholding judgment, the integrity of admitting limits.

It was also, Jean realized with sudden clarity, a trap.

Not a trap of logic. The logic was sound. Marguerite's argument was genuinely compelling, built on principles Jean himself held. If you cannot verify, you cannot conclude. If evidence is insufficient, forcing conclusions is dishonest.

But.

"You offer me purity," Jean said quietly. "The purity of never claiming more than I can prove. The safety of perpetual suspension of judgment."

"I offer you honesty."

"No." Jean shook his head. "You offer me a fortress. The same fortress I have inhabited my entire career. The belief that uncertainty absolves me of responsibility for action."

Marguerite's expression did not change, but something in her stillness suggested Jean had surprised her. "Responsibility for what action?"

"For reporting what I observed, even if I cannot verify it completely. For stating which interpretations seem more plausible, even if I cannot prove them conclusively. For accepting that action under uncertainty is still action—still truthful—if I honestly represent the limits of what I know."

Jean stood and gathered the letter back into his case. His hands were steady now, his voice certain in a way it had not been since the investigation began.

"You are right that I cannot manufacture certainty," he continued. "But I can honestly describe what I found, acknowledge what I could not verify, and let others judge whether my incomplete findings serve truth better than my complete silence."

"And if you are wrong? If the letter is forged and you include it? If innocent men die because you acted under uncertainty?"

"Then I will have acted honestly about what I did not know, rather than refusing to act because I could not know everything." Jean met her eyes. "That is not the same as manufacturing false certainty. It is accepting that truthfulness does not require omniscience."

For a long moment, Marguerite said nothing. She stood at the window with the darkness behind her and the candlelight failing to fully illuminate her face. Jean could not read her expression. Could not determine whether she was disappointed or something else.

Then she smiled—a small, almost sad expression. "You surprise me, Monsieur de Langon. I had thought the argument conclusive."

"It was conclusive. It was also incomplete." Jean moved toward the door. "I thank you for the conversation, Madame. It has clarified my thinking remarkably."

"Has it?" Her voice followed him. "Or has it merely given you permission to do what you already intended?"

Jean paused in the doorway. "Perhaps both. Perhaps neither. I find I have become comfortable with uncertainty about my own motives."

He left the print shop and walked back through dark streets toward his inn. The letter remained in his case. The deadline remained three days away. But something had shifted—not in the evidence, but in Jean himself.

He could not verify the letter. Could not resolve the contradictions in testimony. Could not determine with certainty who had killed Henri de Ségur or why.

But he could write an honest account of what he had observed, what he had failed to verify, and what possibilities remained unresolved. He could submit uncertainty as finding rather than refusing to submit at all.

The difference was small. Perhaps too small to matter in the factional warfare that would follow regardless of what he reported.

But it was his. And it was true.

Jean touched his fingers one final time and felt the gesture settle into something other than fortress. Not measurement of certainty. Just recognition that some questions could be honestly answered with "I do not know"—and that answering them that way was itself a form of action.

Behind him, a light still burned in the print shop's upper window. A silhouette stood there, watchful and still.

Jean did not look back. He had a report to write.
