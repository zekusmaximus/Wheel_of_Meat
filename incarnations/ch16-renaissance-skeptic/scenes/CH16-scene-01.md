The magistrate's chambers smelled of old parchment and wet stone—the scent of institutional permanence threatened by the season's rains. Jean de Langon stood before Bernard de Lacaze's desk and watched candlelight carve the older man's face into planes of judgment and exhaustion. Outside, Bordeaux settled into evening. Inside, the document between them held more danger than any sword Jean had carried on the road.

"Henri de Ségur," de Lacaze said. The name alone was sufficient. Everyone in Guyenne knew what it meant when a Protestant notable died on the road between factions.

Jean touched his thumb to his index finger, then to the next, counting the possibilities as one counts coins. "The reports claim Catholic action, I assume."

"The reports claim many things." De Lacaze pushed the document forward—depositions, witness statements, a complaint filed by de Ségur's widow that named half the Catholic League in Bordeaux. "What they do not claim is consistency."

Jean picked up the topmost page. The hand was educated, the accusations specific. A merchant had seen riders in Catholic livery. A farmer placed armed men near the ambush site at dawn. The widow herself swore de Ségur had received threats from Father Sorbin's circle.

"And the whispers?" Jean asked, because there were always whispers, and de Lacaze would not have summoned him for a simple investigation.

The magistrate rose and moved to the window. Rain streaked the glass, turning the city beyond into shapes that might have been buildings or might have been the memory of order slowly dissolving. "The whispers suggest Henri de Ségur was a moderate. That he was in communication with the Crown. That certain Protestant commanders would prefer a war to a negotiated peace."

Jean set the paper down. His shoulder—the old wound from a roadside encounter six years past—began its familiar ache. Rain always woke it. So did danger one could not see coming.

"You are asking me," Jean said carefully, measuring each word as he measured evidence, "to determine whether the Catholics murdered a Protestant moderate, or whether the Protestants murdered one of their own and blame the Catholics to justify reprisals."

"I am asking you to investigate." De Lacaze's voice carried the weight of a man who had maintained order in Guyenne through eight years of intermittent war and who knew how fragile that order remained. "To gather testimony. To examine the site. To provide me with the truth of what occurred."

The truth. Jean touched his fingers again—thumb to index, index to middle, middle to ring, ring to small. A measuring gesture, as if the truth were something one could weigh and count. Perhaps once he had believed that.

"And if the truth is not...useful?"

De Lacaze turned from the window. The candlelight caught his face differently now—older, wearier, a man who understood exactly what he was asking. "Then I will have an investigation that produced truth. One supposes there is virtue in that."

One supposes. The language of men who knew better than to claim certainty but who must act regardless. Jean had built his life on such language, on the professional neutrality that allowed him to serve magistrates of both confessions, to be useful without being owned. It had kept him alive. It had kept him, he sometimes thought, from having to choose anything that mattered.

"The road to the site?" Jean asked, because the practical questions were easier than the philosophical ones, and because he had already accepted. One did not refuse Bernard de Lacaze, and more importantly, one did not refuse the possibility that careful investigation might yet find something true.

He would need his network: old Thierry in Libourne who tracked every face through the wine market, the notary's widow in Agen who owed Jean a debt from the de Montfort inquiry two years past, perhaps the innkeeper near the crossroads whose neutrality matched Jean's own. No investigation succeeded through one man's effort. The witnesses lied to protect themselves; the network existed to compare the lies, to find truth in the spaces between self-serving accounts.

"Patrols from both sides. You'll need letters of passage." De Lacaze produced them from a drawer—documents signed and sealed, stating Jean de Langon acted under the authority of the Parlement. "Captain de Castelnau commands the Protestant forces in the region. Father Sorbin represents Catholic interests. Both have been informed you are coming. Both will wish to ensure you find the correct conclusions."

Jean took the letters. The seals were authentic, the signatures properly witnessed. They would protect him or condemn him depending on what he found.

De Lacaze reached into a second drawer and withdrew a small leather purse. "Additional compensation," he said quietly. "Beyond the standard fee. For the dangers you will face." Jean let the purse remain on the desk. Not from performance of incorruptibility, not for the magistrate's benefit—simply from recognition that extra coin would not change his methods and accepting it would change his relationship to the work. De Lacaze said nothing as he returned the purse to the drawer, though his eyes flickered with something that might have been reassessment.

"How long do I have?"

"The widow petitions for resolution. The Crown wishes to know if the incident threatens the peace. The Catholic League claims Protestant aggression. The Protestant command claims Catholic assassination." De Lacaze's voice was steady, but his hands, visible now in the candlelight, bore ink stains and the slight tremor of a man who had not slept well in some time. "You have as long as it takes to determine the truth. You have three weeks before I must report to the Parlement."

Three weeks to untangle a killing both factions had already weaponized. Three weeks to find truth in a province where truth was the rarest commodity, hoarded and counterfeit in equal measure.

The investigation would likely fail. Jean understood this without bitterness—simply with the clear-eyed assessment of a man who had attempted enough impossible assignments to recognize another. The factions had already weaponized the killing; the truth lay buried beneath narratives that preceded his involvement. But the impossibility did not sour him. He had learned, somewhere in the accumulated years, to work without expecting success. The work was what he could offer. The outcome belonged to forces larger than one investigator's diligence.

Jean gathered the documents, folding them carefully into his leather case. The letters of passage went into an inner pocket, close to his chest where they would stay dry and where a knife would have to cut deep to reach them.

"I will send word as I have findings to report," Jean said, and heard the careful hedge in his own voice—*findings*, not *conclusions*; *as I have*, not *when*. The language of a man who knew how to avoid commitment even in his promises.

"God keep you on the road," de Lacaze said, and it was not merely formula. On the roads of Guyenne in 1588, one required all the keeping one could pray for.

De Lacaze's hand briefly touched Jean's arm as he spoke—a gesture of personal concern born from eight years of shared work. Jean should have felt comfort in that familiar touch. Instead, a chill passed through him, quick and inexplicable. Old friends who shared confidences. Trusted bonds between men who knew each other's secrets. Something in his body flinched from the pattern, though his mind supplied no reason for the revulsion. The moment passed, and Jean attributed it to the weight of the assignment ahead.

Jean descended the magistrate's stairs into a Bordeaux evening turned dark with rain. His horse waited in the courtyard, already saddled by the magistrate's groom—a preparation that spoke of de Lacaze's certainty that Jean would accept, or perhaps of the older man's need to have this investigation begun before sunset.

The cobblestones gleamed wet under the courtyard torches. Somewhere in the city, bells rang vespers. Jean mounted, feeling the familiar adjustment of weight, the settling of the sword against his hip. He had perhaps an hour of light remaining if he rode now. He could reach an inn he knew, one that asked few questions and where both factions passed without excessive violence.

Or he could wait until morning, and spend the night turning the documents over in his mind, looking for the shape of the thing before the thing itself appeared.

The horse shifted beneath him. Jean touched his reins and felt the animal's readiness, the desire to be moving rather than standing in the rain.

He turned toward the city gate. The investigation had already begun, whether he willed it or not. The only question now was what truth it would find, and what that truth would cost.

Behind him, a light still burned in the magistrate's window. Ahead, the road stretched dark into the countryside where a man had died and where the story of his death waited to be gathered, weighed, and delivered to those who would use it however they required.

Jean touched his fingers to his thumb one final time—counting, measuring, testing the weight of a thing he could not yet see—and rode through the gate into the gathering dark.
