Jean returned to Marguerite's print shop three days after the ambush. His ribs had settled from sharp pain to dull ache, and his shoulder moved with only occasional reminders of torn tissue. The bruises would fade. The questions would not.

Marguerite received him in the same back room where she kept her archives—correspondence, manuscripts, documents that had passed through the shop over the years of her husband's operation and her own continuation of the trade. She gestured to a table stacked with folders.

"I have pulled what I could find relating to de Ségur's communications. You may examine them at your leisure."

The letters were unremarkable. Commissions for printing work. Requests for specific pamphlets. Correspondence with other moderates in Bordeaux and Paris, discussing terms of potential peace negotiations in the careful language of men who knew their words might be intercepted.

Jean was halfway through the third folder when he found it.

The letter was dated two weeks before de Ségur's death. The hand was educated but unfamiliar. The signature was illegible—deliberately so, Jean thought, examining the flourish that obscured any clear identification. The content was not obscure.

> Brother Henri,
>
> Your persistence in these negotiations betrays not only your judgment but our cause. The Crown offers us terms that amount to submission dressed in diplomatic language. You know this. Yet you persist in treating with them as if royal promises held weight beyond the parchment they soil.
>
> The commanders have taken notice. There is talk—I will be plain—of removing obstacles to clarity. You have become such an obstacle. I write not as threat but as warning from one who has served with you and who would see you withdraw from this course before withdrawal becomes impossible.
>
> Consider carefully whether peace at any price is worth the price of your continued presence among us.

Jean read it twice. Then a third time, touching his fingers in sequence as if counting the implications might reduce them to manageable number.

If the letter was genuine, it established Protestant conspiracy. It proved de Ségur had been killed by his own faction for the crime of seeking peace. The Catholic merchant's testimony about Protestant riders would be vindicated. The Protestant farmer's claims about Catholic soldiers would be revealed as faction loyalty rather than observation.

If the letter was genuine.

Jean held it to the light. The paper was period-appropriate—the kind used for private correspondence throughout Guyenne. The ink had aged with the proper fading. The fold marks suggested it had been sealed and carried.

But.

The signature was illegible. The provenance was uncertain—Marguerite claimed it had been in a bundle of papers de Ségur had left with her for safekeeping, but she could not verify when or how it had arrived among the other documents. The content was convenient—too convenient, perhaps, for a letter that so neatly resolved the question of motivation.

Jean set the letter down and looked at Marguerite. "When did you find this?"

"Yesterday, while preparing the archives for your examination. It was misfiled among other correspondence." Her voice was steady, her face composed. "I nearly missed it."

Nearly. Jean touched his middle finger to his thumb. "And you are certain de Ségur left these papers with you?"

"I am certain he left papers. I cannot swear to having examined each one when he deposited them. We handle many documents in this trade, Monsieur. Not all receive equal scrutiny."

The answer was reasonable. It was also useless for purposes of verification.

Jean returned his attention to the letter. The writer referred to "the commanders"—Protestant military leadership. He claimed to have "served with" de Ségur—suggesting military history together. These were details that could be checked. If Protestant commanders had indeed discussed removing de Ségur, there might be other evidence. Other letters. Witnesses who had heard such talk.

Or the letter could be a forgery, manufactured by Catholic interests to implicate Protestant leadership in fratricidal murder. The perfect document to appear at the perfect moment in an investigation stalled by contradictory testimony.

"May I take this?" Jean asked.

"It is evidence in a Parlement investigation." Marguerite's gesture was permissive. "I assume you have authority to claim it."

Jean folded the letter carefully and placed it in his case alongside the pamphlets. The paper felt heavier than its weight—laden with implication that might be truth or might be the most skillful lie he had yet encountered.

Captain Arnaud de Castelnau received Jean in a commandeered manor house that served as Protestant headquarters for the region. The Captain was a man in his fifties, weathered by campaign and diplomacy in equal measure. His courtesy was genuine. So was the sword that rested within easy reach throughout their conversation.

"You wished to discuss your progress, Monsieur de Langon?"

Jean had prepared careful language. "I seek to verify certain details regarding relationships within Protestant command structure. Specifically, whether Henri de Ségur's negotiations with the Crown met with universal approval among Protestant leadership."

De Castelnau's expression did not change. "Henri was a friend. His death was a loss to our cause."

"That is not an answer to my question, Captain."

"No," de Castelnau agreed. "It is not." He leaned back in his chair, his hand still near the sword. "There were men who disagreed with Henri's approach. There are always men who prefer war to compromise. This is not evidence of murder."

"I did not claim it was." Jean touched his fingers carefully, keeping the gesture small. "I merely seek to understand the context of his death."

"The context is that Catholics murdered a Protestant moderate to prevent peace. This is not complicated, Monsieur."

"And yet I have testimony suggesting other possibilities."

"You have testimony suggesting whatever factions wish you to hear." De Castelnau's voice held an edge now, sharp enough to draw blood if Jean pressed too hard. "Tell me—when you submit your report, will you include speculation about Protestant fratricide? Or will you report what the evidence clearly shows: Catholic assassination of a man whose only crime was seeking peace?"

The question was both threat and test. Jean felt it settle into the space between them like a blade laid on a table—not drawn, but visible.

"I will report what I can verify," Jean said.

"How admirable." The Captain's smile did not reach his eyes. "And if what you can verify serves Catholic interests? What then of your neutrality?"

Jean stood. His shoulder ached, and his ribs reminded him that neutrality had already been tested on the road through oak forest. "I serve the Parlement, Captain. Not the factions."

"The Parlement is factional, whether it admits it or not. As are you, whether you admit it or not." De Castelnau rose as well—a gesture of courtesy that framed dismissal. "I suggest, Monsieur de Langon, that you consider carefully what findings your investigation produces. Protestant patience is not infinite. Neither is Protestant memory."

Jean left the manor with the letter still in his case and the Captain's warning ringing in his ears like a bell tolling accusation.

He returned to his inn as evening fell. The letter lay on his desk like a piece of ordnance that might explode regardless of how carefully he handled it.

If he included it in his report, he determined the investigation's outcome. Protestant conspiracy. Internal murder. The Catholic merchant vindicated, the Protestant farmer revealed as partisan rather than witness.

If he excluded it, he suppressed potential evidence. Withheld information that might be crucial. Allowed his own doubt about the letter's authenticity to override his duty to present all findings.

If the letter was genuine, excluding it would be dishonest.

If the letter was forged, including it would be complicity in deception.

And he could not determine which it was.

Jean touched his fingers in sequence. Thumb to index. Index to middle. Middle to ring. Ring to small. A complete circuit of counting that produced no certainty, only the recognition that certainty was not available.

The honest course seemed clear: investigate further. Seek additional evidence about Protestant command discussions. Interview more witnesses. Delay the report until verification was possible.

But the magistrate's deadline was one week away. Captain de Castelnau's warning was fresh. And somewhere in Bordeaux, other forces were watching, waiting to see what Jean's investigation would produce.

He could not know if the letter was genuine.

Any action he took regarding it—include, exclude, or continue investigating—required him to act despite that uncertainty.

This, Jean realized, was the trap. Not the specific question of one document's authenticity, but the larger question Marguerite had asked: What do you do when you cannot verify? When testimony contradicts? When evidence might be genuine or might be forgery?

Do you force a conclusion? Or do you admit uncertainty and refuse to conclude?

Jean stared at the letter until the candle burned low and his eyes ached from reading the same words over and over, searching for some detail that would reveal truth beneath the careful script.

The words did not change. The signature remained illegible. The provenance stayed unverifiable.

And the deadline drew closer with every passing hour.

Jean finally set the letter aside and tried to sleep. But even in darkness, the question followed him:

If I cannot verify, can I conclude?

And if I cannot conclude, what am I doing here at all?
