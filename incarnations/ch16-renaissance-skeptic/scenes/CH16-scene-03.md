The road between market towns ran through oak forest thick enough to muffle sound and channel sight into the narrow corridor of packed earth that passed for passage. Jean rode with his hand loose on his reins and his attention spread across the middle distance—not staring at any one shadow, but holding all of them in peripheral awareness. A man learned this, traveling alone through country where factions maintained order only within sight of their own walls.

His shoulder ached. The rain had passed but left the air heavy with the promise of more, and old wounds remembered weather before the sky did.

The first arrow missed him by a hand's breadth.

Jean heard the snap of the bowstring and the hiss of the shaft and then his horse was screaming and rearing and he was already moving—left boot out of stirrup, weight shifting, hands releasing the reins as he threw himself sideways out of the saddle. He hit the ground hard on his good shoulder and rolled, hearing the second arrow thud into earth where his chest had been.

Three men came out of the trees. Masked. Armed with blades now that the arrows had failed to drop him cleanly.

Jean drew his sword as he found his feet. The blade cleared the scabbard in one practiced motion, though his left arm already burned from the fall and his right hand had to do the work of both. One of the attackers swung high—an opening cut meant to test his guard or draw him into overextension.

Jean parried and stepped inside the man's reach. Close work now. The kind of fighting that happened on roads and in alleys, where there was no space for elegance and survival depended on doing the ugliest thing first.

He drove his pommel into the attacker's masked face and felt bone give. The man went down. Jean spun to meet the second—a thinner fighter, faster, with a short sword and a dagger in the off-hand. The kind of combination a man used when he knew his business.

They circled. Jean's breath came hard. The third attacker had moved to flank him, and his horse had fled, and the trees that had provided the ambush now provided cover for however many other men might be waiting.

The fast one lunged. Jean parried the sword and felt the dagger come searching for his ribs—a feint within the primary attack, the kind of doubled strike that killed men who thought they had successfully defended. Jean twisted, taking the dagger point on his leather jack rather than his flesh, and cut low across the man's lead leg.

The blade bit deep. The attacker stumbled and Jean was already moving—pivot, cut upward, feel the sword meet resistance and then break through as the man's throat opened and blood sprayed black in the forest shadow.

The third man was running.

Jean let him go. His shoulder screamed where the old wound had torn something in the fall. His ribs hurt where the dagger had skipped across the leather. One man was dead. One was crawling away with his face broken. And the third had decided survival meant abandoning whatever coin had bought his service today.

Jean bent and tore the mask from the dead man's face. Young. Perhaps twenty. Features that might have been from Bordeaux or from any of a dozen market towns in Guyenne. No livery beneath the rough traveling cloak. No insignia. Nothing to identify which faction had sent him or whether he was merely a brigand who saw a lone traveler and chose easy prey.

Jean searched the body with shaking hands. A few coins. A knife worn with honest use. A scrap of rosary—Catholic, or at least the affectation of Catholicism. But half the Protestants in France had been Catholic two decades ago, and rosaries were cheap, and a man might carry anything if it helped him pass a checkpoint.

The wounded attacker had stopped crawling and now lay still, breathing in wet gasps. Jean moved to him and pulled off the mask. Older. Scarred across one cheek. Eyes that tracked Jean's movement with animal awareness of mortality.

"Who sent you?" Jean asked.

The man spat blood. Said nothing.

Jean pressed his sword point to the hollow of the man's throat—not breaking skin, but resting there with the weight of a promise. "I am Jean de Langon, agent of the Parlement. Tell me who commissioned this and I will see you to a surgeon."

The man's eyes met his. For a moment Jean thought he would speak, would offer some name or some faction identifier that would make sense of this. Instead the man smiled—a red grimace that showed broken teeth—and said, "Figure it out yourself, investigator."

Then he closed his eyes and Jean felt the body go slack in the way bodies did when men decided dying was easier than talking.

Jean sat back on his heels. His hands were shaking now that the fight was finished and the blood was cooling on his blade. He wiped the sword on the dead man's cloak and sheathed it with a scrape of steel on wood that sounded too loud in the empty forest.

Who had sent them?

Catholic forces, eliminating a Protestant-sympathizing investigator before he could exonerate Catholics of de Ségur's murder?

Protestant forces, silencing someone who might dig too deep into the possibility of internal fratricide?

Or merely bandits, and Jean was manufacturing conspiracy from simple violence?

He could not know.

Jean found his horse a quarter mile down the road, trembling but uninjured. He mounted with difficulty, feeling every bruise from the fall settle into his frame. His ribs ached where the dagger had struck. His shoulder felt like someone had driven a spike through the joint.

But he was alive. Two men were not. And somewhere, someone had decided Jean's investigation was dangerous enough to warrant killing.

He touched his fingers in sequence—thumb to index, index to middle, middle to ring—counting the possibilities as he had counted them before. Catholic. Protestant. Brigand. Faction within faction. Personal vendetta from some previous case.

The gesture brought no certainty. Only the recognition that certainty was not available, and that the lack of certainty would not stop the next attack.

Jean rode on through the forest, watching the shadows, feeling the weight of the letter of passage in his pocket and knowing it would protect him only as long as whoever wanted him dead chose to respect the Parlement's authority. Which was to say, not at all.

His shoulder burned. His ribs throbbed. And somewhere ahead on this road lay more interviews, more testimony, more accumulating contradictions.

But now he knew: neutrality was not safety. Doubt was not protection. Both sides were watching, and both sides would act.

The question was no longer whether he could discover the truth about Henri de Ségur's death.

The question was whether he would survive the attempt.

Jean touched his fingers one more time—counting, measuring, testing the weight of a fortress he had thought secure—and felt the first stone in that fortress shift beneath his hand.
