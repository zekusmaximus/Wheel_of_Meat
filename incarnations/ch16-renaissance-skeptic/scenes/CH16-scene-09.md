Jean left Bordeaux at dusk. The gate guards examined his papers with the careful attention of men who knew warrants might follow any traveler, but his letter of passage from the Parlement was still valid—would remain valid until someone with authority revoked it. By then, Jean intended to be across the provincial boundary into territory where Guyenne's factional feuds held less immediate weight.

His horse was the same animal that had carried him through the investigation. Steady, not fast. The kind of mount that served for travel rather than escape. Jean had considered acquiring a faster horse, then rejected the idea. He was not fleeing. He was moving toward whatever came next with the same methodical certainty he brought to everything else.

The road stretched west toward the coast. If he could reach La Rochelle, the Protestant stronghold might offer temporary sanctuary. Or it might not—his report had satisfied neither faction, which meant he was enemy to both. But La Rochelle was possibility, and Bordeaux had become certainty of a lethal kind.

The first hour passed in silence broken only by his horse's hoofbeats and the evening calls of birds settling into roost. Jean rode with his hand near his sword and his attention spread across the landscape. Oak forest to the left, open farmland to the right, and ahead the road narrowing into country where faction control gave way to the older law of isolated men with weapons.

He did not see them until they stepped onto the road.

Six riders. Three from the forest to his left, three from a farmhouse to his right. The coordination spoke of planning rather than opportunistic banditry. They blocked the road ahead and Jean heard hoofbeats behind—more riders closing the trap.

Jean reined his horse to a halt. His shoulder began its familiar ache, the old wound's prophecy of violence to come. He recognized none of the riders' faces, but their equipment told him enough: professional soldiers, not bandits. Men who followed orders and expected payment.

"Jean de Langon." The speaker was a lean man perhaps forty years old, mounted on a horse too fine for common service. "Your presence is no longer required on these roads."

"By whose authority?" Jean kept his voice level, professional. One hand on the reins, the other resting near his sword.

"Does it matter?" The man's smile held no humor. "Your report pleased neither the Captain nor the Father. Both concluded you had outlived your usefulness. We are...a collaborative enterprise."

Catholic and Protestant, working together. United only in their need to punish the man who had refused to serve either faction's narrative. Jean felt a bitter satisfaction at the confirmation: his neutrality had succeeded so well that both sides recognized him as enemy.

"The Parlement—" Jean began.

"Sends its regrets." The lean man drew his sword. "You will not be the first investigator to die on these roads. Bandits are everywhere in Guyenne. The magistrate will understand."

The attack came from three sides at once.

Jean spurred his horse forward—not toward escape but toward the narrowest gap in the riders ahead. If he could break through, if the road opened enough to give him space to run—

His horse screamed and went down. Someone had hamstrung it as Jean charged. He felt the animal collapse beneath him and threw himself clear, hitting the ground hard on his bad shoulder. The old wound tore. Pain blazed through his left arm like fire through dry tinder.

Jean rolled and came up with his sword drawn. Three men dismounted and came at him on foot. Professional work—they did not rush, did not give him the advantage of their impatience. They simply closed in with the patience of men who knew the outcome.

The first man swung high. Jean parried but his left arm would not fully extend—the shoulder screamed and gave and nearly dropped his guard. He twisted away from the second man's thrust and cut low, feeling his blade bite into thigh. The man went down.

But the others were already moving. A sword came for his ribs. Jean parried with his dagger and felt the shock of impact jar his injured shoulder. His left arm was useless now—he could barely hold the dagger, could not parry effectively. His right hand did all the work and it was not enough.

The lean commander had dismounted and now joined the fight. Four men circling one. Jean backed against the body of his dying horse, using the animal for cover, conserving strength he did not have for a fight he could not win.

"Make it quick," Jean said. His breath came hard. Blood ran down his left arm where the shoulder wound had torn fully open. "I ask that courtesy."

"You ask for more than you gave us." The commander's voice was almost regretful. "Your report gave us nothing but complications. We give you the same in return."

They came at him together.

Jean fought. Not well—his shoulder betrayed him, his left arm hung useless, and the four men were skilled enough to coordinate their strikes. But he fought because fighting was what remained. He cut one man across the arm. Drove his pommel into another's face. Made them work for it.

It was not enough.

A sword took him in the side, punching through his jack to scrape along ribs. Jean twisted away and felt his legs give. He went down into the dirt of the road, his sword falling from nerveless fingers as shock and blood loss did what four armed men had struggled to accomplish.

The lean commander stood over him. His blade rested against Jean's throat—not cutting, not yet. Simply there as promise.

"Any final words? A message for the magistrate?"

Jean looked up at the darkening sky. Stars were beginning to show between clouds. Beautiful, he thought distantly. He had not noticed them often enough during the investigation. Too focused on testimony and documents to observe the simple fact of evening light.

"Tell him," Jean said, and his voice was steady despite the blood soaking through his doublet, "that I told the truth about what I didn't know. That was mine to give."

"The truth." The commander's laugh was bitter. "The truth got you killed, investigator. I hope it was worth the price."

Jean closed his eyes. "It was true. That is worth something."

The blade moved. Jean felt pressure, then warmth, then the strange sensation of his breath escaping from the wrong place. His body understood before his mind did: the cutting was done. What remained was simply the time it took for understanding to fade.

Not long now.

Jean lay in the dirt and felt his life drain into the road he had traveled so carefully, investigating a murder he could not solve with tools that could not reach the truth they were meant to grasp.

He had failed. The investigation produced no useful conclusion. His report satisfied no one. Both factions had turned against him. Peace in Guyenne would not be served by his work.

But.

He had told the truth about what he did not know.

He had acted honestly under uncertainty rather than refusing to act because certainty was impossible.

He had submitted findings that were incomplete but true, rather than conclusions that were useful but false.

It was not much. Perhaps not enough to justify the price he was paying in blood and gasping breath.

But it was his. And it was true.

Jean's fingers twitched—thumb to index, the counting gesture for the final time. Not measuring evidence now. Simply acknowledging: this is what remained. This small honest thing in the gathering dark.

The sky above him was full dark now, stars bright and cold and beautiful. Jean watched them and felt his awareness begin to narrow. The pain was distant. The voices of the men who had killed him faded. What remained was simply the question burning in the center of his fading consciousness:

*If I can die for honest uncertainty, what can I die for with conviction?*

The question was new. Urgent. Hungry in a way Jean had never permitted himself to be hungry during life.

He had learned to act under uncertainty. To speak truthfully about limits while accepting consequences. To choose integrity over safety.

But he had never found what deserved certain commitment. What cause was worth dying for with eyes open and heart full and no doubt to shelter behind. What truth was worth not just acknowledging but proclaiming. What people were worth not just investigating but joining.

The hunger for that answer pulled at him—not backward into the life that was ending, but forward into something else. Somewhere ahead in the turning wheel. A century distant, two centuries, it did not matter. There would be a cause. A commitment that did not require pretending to know. A choice made with conviction rather than careful hedge.

Ready to believe.

Ready to commit.

Ready to die not for honest doubt but for certain purpose.

The question burned brighter than the pain, brighter than the fading stars, brighter than anything Jean had felt in forty-three years of careful neutrality.

*What is worth dying for with conviction?*

The wheel turned.

Consciousness pulled loose like thread from fabric, seeking the pattern that would answer the question Jean de Langon had finally learned to ask.

The road faded. The pain faded. The men standing over his body faded.

What remained was the hunger—pure, clean, reaching forward into darkness that held somewhere within it the shape of commitment Jean had spent a lifetime avoiding.

Ready now.

Ready to find what deserved certainty.

Ready to die for it.

The wheel turned.

---

Jean de Langon died on the road west of Bordeaux three days after submitting his report. The official finding was banditry. The magistrate accepted this conclusion because no alternative served order. Both factions claimed vindication in the investigator's death: the Catholics because he had failed to prove Protestant conspiracy, the Protestants because he had failed to exonerate Catholic assassination.

His report was filed and forgotten. Henri de Ségur's murder remained unresolved. Guyenne tumbled into another year of uneasy peace that would eventually fracture into war.

None of this mattered to the consciousness that had been Jean de Langon. It was already moving forward, already seeking the answer to the question that had ignited in his final breath.

What is worth dying for with conviction?

Somewhere ahead—in a different country, a different century—that question would find its answer.

And the wheel would turn again.
