The print shop smelled of ink and metal—the tang of letters in their cases, the oil on the press mechanism, the chemical residue of whatever solvents kept the type clean enough to serve. Jean stood in the doorway and let his eyes adjust to the interior dimness. Afternoon light filtered through windows too small for the work they illuminated, falling in dusty shafts across tables covered in pages and proofs.

"Monsieur de Langon." The voice came from the back of the shop, where a woman stood beside a compositor's desk. She set down her work—a page of set type, Jean saw, dense with text—and moved forward with the economy of someone accustomed to navigating the shop's narrow aisles. "I wondered when the Parlement would send someone."

Marguerite Viret was perhaps thirty-eight, dressed in the dark wool of a widow who could not afford extended mourning but maintained its forms from habit or conviction. Her hair was dark, pulled back severely from a face that might have been called severe itself had her eyes not held a quality of careful intelligence that suggested severity was performance rather than temperament.

"Madame Viret." Jean inclined his head. "I seek information regarding Henri de Ségur. I am told he received correspondence through your establishment."

"Everyone receives correspondence through my establishment." She gestured to a cabinet against the wall. "We are printers, Monsieur. Words are our trade, whether bound in books or carried in letters."

"Specifically, I am interested in de Ségur's connections to the intellectual networks in Guyenne. His conversations. His...opinions."

Marguerite regarded him with eyes that seemed to look past his question to the motive beneath it. "You mean you wish to know if he was truly a moderate, or if the rumors of his negotiations with the Crown were propaganda manufactured by whichever faction benefits from the claim."

Jean touched his thumb to his index finger—a small gesture, counted without thought. "I wish to know what can be known. The rest is speculation."

"Is it?" She moved to a shelf and withdrew a folder of papers. "Come. I will show you what Henri de Ségur requested we print, and you may judge for yourself what it tells you about his opinions."

The documents were pamphlets—political, argumentative, calling for negotiated peace and mutual tolerance in language that would satisfy no one who believed satisfaction came through victory. Jean read while Marguerite watched, her hands resting on the compositor's desk with the stillness of someone accustomed to waiting.

"These would make him enemies," Jean said.

"These made him enemies in both camps." Marguerite's voice carried neither approval nor condemnation. "The Catholics saw Protestant duplicity. The Protestants saw betrayal. Truth, in such times, is simply the accusation that sticks hardest."

Jean looked up from the pamphlets. Something in her phrasing caught his attention—a philosophical precision unusual in a woman whose education came from trade rather than institution. "You do not believe in truth?"

"I believe truth exists." Marguerite met his gaze directly. "I do not believe it can be reliably accessed through human testimony. We see what serves our interests. We remember what confirms our grievances. And we call the result truth when it would be more honest to call it necessity."

The argument was clean. Skeptical in the mode Jean recognized from his own education at the Collège de Guyenne. Que sais-je? What do I know? And the answer, if one followed the logic far enough, was very little indeed.

"You have read the Essays," Jean said. Not a question—Montaigne's work was too visible in her speech for it to be coincidence.

"My husband printed a pirated edition." The ghost of something that might have been amusement crossed her face. "I set the type myself for several chapters. One cannot help but absorb the arguments when one must arrange them letter by letter."

Jean found himself smiling despite the ache in his ribs and the weight of the investigation. "And what did the type-setter conclude about Montaigne's philosophy?"

"That he asks better questions than he provides answers. Which may be the point." Marguerite gestured to the pamphlets. "Is this sufficient for your investigation?"

"It suggests de Ségur was sincere in his moderation. But sincerity is motive, not evidence. I still cannot determine who killed him."

"Perhaps that is because determination is not possible." Marguerite's voice was gentle, almost sympathetic, in a way that made Jean's hands tighten on the pamphlets. "You have contradictory testimonies. Unverifiable documents. Interested parties on all sides. What if the truth is that you cannot know?"

Jean set the pamphlets down carefully. "Then my investigation fails."

"Does it? Or does it succeed in establishing the boundaries of knowledge?" She leaned forward slightly. "There is a kind of honesty in admitting uncertainty. Perhaps more honest than forcing a conclusion to satisfy those who demand one."

The argument was seductive. Jean felt it slide beneath his professional armor like a blade testing for gaps. He had thought this himself, had he not? That honest doubt might be wiser than false certainty?

But to say so to a magistrate who required answers. To put it in a report that would determine whether Guyenne tumbled back into open war.

"I am charged with investigation, not philosophy," Jean said, and heard the defensiveness in his own voice.

"Are the two separable?" Marguerite asked. "You investigate to determine truth. But if the tools of investigation cannot reach truth—if testimony is unreliable, documents forgeable, evidence interpretable in multiple ways—then perhaps the investigation succeeds only in demonstrating what cannot be known."

Jean touched his fingers in sequence. Thumb to index. Index to middle. The familiar counting gesture that brought no certainty, only the illusion of measurement.

"You offer me a dilemma with no exit," he said quietly.

"I offer you what your own investigation has already found." Marguerite's gaze was steady, neither cruel nor kind—simply observant. "Contradiction without resolution. Three versions of one event. And the question: what does a man honestly report when honesty means acknowledging he cannot determine which version is true?"

Jean looked at her face in the dim light of the print shop. There was something in her stillness that seemed older than her years, as if the widow's grief had aged her in ways that went beyond the physical. Or perhaps it was simply the wisdom that came from surviving in a profession where every printed word might bring royal censors or factional reprisal.

"I thank you for your assistance," Jean said, and took the pamphlets she offered.

"If you require additional documents, I maintain an archive." Marguerite moved toward a back room. "Correspondence, receipts, manuscripts awaiting printing. You are welcome to examine them."

"I may take you up on that offer." Jean tucked the pamphlets into his leather case. "Though I suspect I will find in them the same contradictions I have found everywhere else."

"Quite possibly." Marguerite paused in the doorway to the back room, and for a moment the light from the window caught her face at an angle that rendered her expression unreadable—shadowed, watchful, as if she were measuring Jean with the same careful skepticism she applied to everything else.

Then she smiled—a small, knowing expression—and said, "The question then becomes what you do with contradictions that cannot be resolved. Do you force a resolution? Or do you accept that some things remain genuinely uncertain?"

Jean left the shop with his mind turning over her words like a coin examined for weight and wear. The philosophical skepticism was not foreign to him. He had read Montaigne. He had questioned the reliability of testimony since his first investigation.

But Marguerite Viret had articulated the endpoint of that skepticism with a clarity that felt both liberating and dangerous. If you cannot verify, you cannot conclude. If witnesses contradict without resolution, perhaps the honest report is to say: I do not know.

It was only later, as Jean walked back toward his inn through streets turned gray with evening, that he remembered the moment when Marguerite had paused in the doorway. The strange stillness of her expression. The sense that she was watching him with something more than professional courtesy or intellectual curiosity.

He glanced back toward the print shop. An upper window showed a candle's glow. A silhouette stood there—still, observant, patient as stone.

Jean shook off the impression. Widows kept vigil. Printers worked late. There was nothing uncanny in a woman standing at her own window.

But the image stayed with him as he climbed the stairs to his room: Marguerite Viret in the candlelight, watching with eyes that seemed to look through him to something beyond.

He set the pamphlets on his desk and tried to focus on the investigation. But her question returned, insistent as a psalm:

What do you do with contradictions that cannot be resolved?

And beneath it, the more dangerous question she had planted:

What if honesty means admitting you cannot know?
