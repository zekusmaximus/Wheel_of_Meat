Jean sat at his desk as dawn broke over Bordeaux. The candle had burned down to a stub. His hand ached from hours of writing. Before him lay the report—ten pages of careful script, an accounting that would satisfy no one and might condemn him.

He read it through one final time.

> To Bernard de Lacaze, Magistrate of the Parlement of Bordeaux:
>
> I submit herewith my findings regarding the death of Henri de Ségur, Protestant notable, discovered deceased on the road between Bordeaux and Saint-Émilion on the 14th day of September, 1588.
>
> **Testimony Gathered:**
>
> I have interviewed three primary witnesses. Martin Dufour, Catholic merchant, reports observing riders in Protestant livery departing the area after the approximate time of death. His testimony is internally consistent but relies on identification of faction markers at distance and after learning of the murder, which may have influenced his recollection.
>
> Arnaud Besse, Protestant farmer, reports observing armed men near the site before dawn on the day of the murder. He identifies them as Catholic League soldiers based on their bearing and his knowledge of Catholic movements through his lands. I could not verify specific insignia or commission.
>
> Lisette, servant at the estate where de Ségur lodged the night before his death, reports overhearing an argument between de Ségur and another Protestant gentleman regarding negotiations with the Crown. She did not observe the second man and cannot identify him. Her account suggests possible factional conflict within Protestant leadership but cannot be corroborated.
>
> **Physical Evidence:**
>
> The site of death shows signs of ambush but no specific markers of faction identity. De Ségur died from sword wounds consistent with multiple attackers. The body was discovered by local farmers and removed before I could examine it in situ.
>
> **Documentary Evidence:**
>
> I have obtained a letter, allegedly from Protestant correspondence, suggesting commanders had discussed removing de Ségur as an obstacle to their preferred course of action. The letter's provenance cannot be fully verified. The signature is illegible. The content is consistent with motive but could equally serve as manufactured evidence to implicate Protestant leadership.
>
> **Analysis:**
>
> The testimony is irreconcilable. If the Catholic merchant's account is accurate, Protestant forces killed de Ségur. If the Protestant farmer's account is accurate, Catholic forces are responsible. If the servant's account is accurate, the murder may have been internal to Protestant leadership.
>
> Each witness believes their testimony. None can be definitively proven false. Cross-examination reveals no clear deception but also no path to resolution.
>
> The letter, if genuine, strongly suggests Protestant conspiracy. If forged, it represents sophisticated Catholic propaganda. I have found no conclusive method to determine authenticity.
>
> **Conclusion:**
>
> I cannot determine with certainty who killed Henri de Ségur or under whose authority the killing was commissioned. The evidence permits multiple interpretations. Catholic assassination, Protestant fratricide, and banditry all remain possible based on available testimony.
>
> I can honestly report what I observed: contradictory witness accounts, unverifiable documentary evidence, and physical findings consistent with ambush but not with specific faction identification.
>
> I cannot honestly report a conclusion about who bears responsibility. To do so would require claiming certainty I do not possess or manufacturing findings to serve factional interests rather than truth.
>
> I submit this report acknowledging its incompleteness, with the recognition that honest investigation sometimes produces uncertainty rather than resolution.
>
> Respectfully submitted,
> Jean de Langon
> Agent of the Parlement of Bordeaux
> 20th day of September, 1588

Jean set down the final page and touched his fingers in sequence. Not counting, not measuring. Simply the gesture itself—a recognition marker that meant nothing except that he was who he had always been, even as everything had changed.

The report was professional suicide. De Lacaze would understand that immediately. So would anyone who read it.

Jean had not concluded Catholic guilt, which would enrage Protestant commanders. He had not concluded Protestant conspiracy, which would provoke Catholic League reprisal. He had not even concluded that determination was impossible in a way that preserved his neutrality—he had simply stated what he found and what he failed to find, with no attempt to protect either faction's narrative or his own reputation.

The Catholics would see Protestant protection. The Protestants would see Catholic bias. The politiques would see incompetence. All of them would be wrong, but none of them would care.

Jean sealed the report and stood. His shoulder ached from the hours of sitting. His eyes burned from candlelight and lack of sleep. But his hands were steady as he gathered the document into his leather case.

Outside, Bordeaux was waking. Church bells rang for morning prayer. Market vendors began their calls. The city moved into another day of uneasy peace, not knowing that Jean's report might tip the balance toward war.

Or might not. Perhaps it would change nothing. Perhaps both factions had already decided their conclusions and would simply ignore findings that failed to serve their purposes.

Jean walked through streets turned gold with sunrise toward the magistrate's residence. The letter of passage still rested in his pocket—protection that had proven illusory on the forest road and would prove equally useless against the consequences of an honest report.

The words came before the reasoning. Tell the truth. Tell what you found and what you failed to find. The certainty was absolute, inexplicable—not a conclusion reached but a knowledge remembered, though he could not have said from where. It felt less like deciding than like recalling something he had always known but forgotten.

His mind caught up a moment later, constructing the logic his soul had already grasped.

He was done with fortresses. Done with the belief that neutrality meant safety or that withholding judgment meant wisdom. Uncertainty was real. Verification was often impossible. And truthful action did not require omniscience—only honest acknowledgment of limits.

Bernard de Lacaze received him in the same chambers where the investigation had begun. The magistrate looked older than he had two weeks prior, as if the weight of maintaining order in Guyenne had compressed his remaining years into visible form.

Jean placed the report on the desk between them.

De Lacaze read in silence. Jean watched the older man's face and saw the recognition settle: this report protected nothing, concluded nothing, satisfied no one.

When de Lacaze finally looked up, his expression was careful. "You understand what this means."

"I understand that it is honest."

"Honesty." The magistrate's voice was dry. "A luxury we can rarely afford."

"Perhaps. But it is what I have to offer." Jean met de Lacaze's eyes. "I could have forced a conclusion. I chose instead to report truthfully on what I could not determine."

"The Parlement will not accept this."

"I know."

"Captain de Castelnau will see it as evidence you suppressed findings of Catholic guilt."

"I know."

"Father Sorbin will claim you protected Protestant conspirators."

"I know." Jean touched his fingers briefly—thumb to index, a half-gesture. "But I know something else as well: any other report would have been a lie. Perhaps a useful lie. Perhaps a lie that served peace or justice or someone's version of order. But a lie nonetheless."

De Lacaze was quiet for a long moment. Then he sighed—a sound of exhaustion that went bone-deep. "You are a better man than this province deserves, Jean de Langon. I hope that brings you comfort when both sides come for you."

"It will not." Jean stood. "But it is mine. And it is true."

He left the magistrate's chambers and descended into a Bordeaux morning that smelled of bread baking and the river. Somewhere in this city, Father Sorbin was receiving word of Jean's report. Somewhere else, Captain de Castelnau was learning that the investigation had concluded nothing useful to Protestant interests.

Jean had perhaps a day before both factions moved against him. Perhaps less. Men who refused to serve anyone's narrative were more dangerous than men who served the wrong side.

He returned to his inn and began packing. His belongings were few—a traveler's life, an investigator's necessities. He would leave Bordeaux tonight. Perhaps reach another jurisdiction before the warrants were issued. Perhaps find magistrates who valued honest uncertainty over useful conclusions.

Or perhaps not. Perhaps the next ambush would succeed where the first had failed. Perhaps Father Sorbin's urbane courtesy or Captain de Castelnau's honorable warning would give way to blades in the dark.

Jean touched his fingers one last time and felt the gesture settle into something that was neither fortress nor measurement. Simply an acknowledgment: I did what I could honestly do. I said what I could honestly say. The consequences are not mine to control.

The report lay on de Lacaze's desk. Jean's fate lay somewhere ahead on the roads of Guyenne. And between them stretched the small space where a man had chosen truthfulness under uncertainty over the safety of manufactured certainty.

It was not much. Perhaps not enough.

But it was true.

Jean shouldered his bag and walked out of the inn into the morning light. The road waited. So did whatever came next.

He was ready for both.
