# Scene 2: The Witnesses

The inn called itself the Rose and Crown, a name that claimed neutrality through royal appeal while the rose itself might signify Lancaster or simply the vine that grew over the stable door. Jean had learned to read such ambiguities. In 1588, survival often depended on symbols that could mean whatever the armed observer required them to mean.

He sat in the common room and listened to Martin Dufour describe the murder. The merchant was a thick man gone soft in his middle years, prosperous enough to travel with goods but not wealthy enough to avoid the roads. His hands moved as he spoke, sketching shapes in the air as if the gestures might lend his words additional substance.

"Protestant riders," Dufour said. "I saw them clear as I see you, Monsieur. Three men, maybe four, in the livery of the Navarre forces. They came past me on the road at speed, not two hours after I'd passed the place where they found poor de Ségur."

Jean touched his index finger to his thumb. "You saw their livery clearly? At speed?"

"Clear enough. The white scarf, the plume. Protestant badges." Dufour's certainty had the quality of a man who knew what answer would serve his interests. He was Catholic—Jean had established that within the first three questions—and Catholic merchants who testified against Protestant raiders might expect certain protections, certain preferential treatment when the next convoy needed passage.

"And you saw the riders before you discovered the body?"

"After, Monsieur. I passed the site—saw nothing amiss, God be thanked—and met the riders perhaps a league onward. It was only when I reached the next town that I heard de Ségur had been killed on that very stretch."

Jean made a note. The merchant had seen riders. He had later heard of a killing. Between the two events, his memory had helpfully arranged the riders into murderers wearing identifiable Protestant markings. Whether this was honest error or useful invention, Jean could not determine from words alone.

"I am grateful for your testimony," Jean said, and watched Dufour's face brighten at the suggestion his account had been believed.

The Protestant household was less welcoming.

Arnaud Besse received Jean in a parlor that smelled of beeswax and the righteousness of the persecuted. He was a farmer, prosperous by the standards of the land, and his home bore the marks of a man who had survived by never quite provoking the authorities while never quite submitting to them.

"Catholic soldiers," Besse said. His voice was flat, certain, carrying the weight of a man who had watched his neighbors killed and his fields burned and who no longer troubled himself with doubts about which faction meant him harm. "I saw them the morning of the killing. Before dawn, lurking near the crossroads where they found Henri."

"How many?" Jean asked.

"Six. Maybe seven. Armed men, with the look of League soldiers about them."

Jean's shoulder gave a twinge. Rain was coming, or perhaps it was merely the proximity to something that would draw blood. "You saw them clearly? Before dawn?"

"I know soldiers when I see them." Besse's jaw set. "And I know Catholic movements when they come through my land without asking leave."

Jean touched his thumb to his middle finger, counting the certainties that stacked like coins and spent like counterfeits. "Did you see their colors? Any insignia?"

"I saw armed Catholics near the place where a Protestant moderate was murdered." Besse leaned forward. "What more insignia does a man require?"

Everything else, Jean thought, but did not say. A soldier's livery. A specific commission. Some detail that could be verified beyond the witness's own conviction that Catholics must be guilty because Catholics had been guilty before.

"I am grateful for your testimony," Jean said again, and saw Besse's face harden at the formulaic courtesy—a hardening that suggested the farmer knew his account had been noted but not necessarily credited.

The third witness Jean found at the site itself.

The crossroads where they had discovered de Ségur's body lay a half-day's ride from Bordeaux, in country that belonged to no faction strongly enough to prevent the other's passage. The site had been cleared—the body removed, the blood washed away by rain—but the servant who had found the corpse still worked at a nearby estate.

Her name was Lisette. She was perhaps nineteen, thin in the way of those whose meals depend on their employer's temperament. She met Jean in the kitchen yard, away from the house, where the steward could not easily overhear.

"I heard them arguing," she said, and Jean's hand stilled on his notes.

"Arguing? When?"

"The night before they found him. I was bringing wine to the private dining room at my master's house—de Ségur was a guest here, see, on his way to Bordeaux. He was in the parlor with another gentleman. A Protestant gentleman, by the sound of their talk."

Jean touched each finger in sequence. "You heard them argue about what?"

"I didn't understand it all, Monsieur. But I heard de Ségur say something about negotiations, about the Crown's offer, about how war served no one. And the other man—he was angry. Said de Ségur was betraying the cause, selling out for royal favor."

"Did you see this other man?"

Lisette shook her head. "Only heard him. But he was angry, Monsieur. The kind of angry that doesn't forget."

Jean wrote carefully. Here was testimony that served neither faction's simple narrative—neither the Catholic murder nor the Protestant defense. Here was suggestion that de Ségur had been killed by his own people for the crime of seeking peace.

"And in the morning?"

"In the morning, de Ségur rode out early. I saw him leave. The other gentleman had gone in the night—I don't know when. And then that afternoon, they brought back de Ségur's body from the crossroads."

Jean looked at the girl's face. She was frightened, he saw. Frightened of what she had heard, frightened of having spoken of it, frightened of the men on both sides who would prefer their simple stories to her complicated truth.

"You have told no one else of this argument?"

"Who would I tell, Monsieur? The Catholics would say it proves nothing. The Protestants would say I lie. And de Ségur is dead either way." Her eyes met his—direct, weary, old beyond her years. "I am telling you because you asked. But I don't know what good the truth does when both sides have already decided what they believe."

Jean rode back to his inn as evening fell. Three witnesses. Three mutually exclusive accounts.

The Catholic merchant had seen Protestant raiders fleeing the scene—except he had seen them after passing the site, before he knew a murder had occurred, and his memory had helpfully filled in details that served his faction's narrative.

The Protestant farmer had seen Catholic soldiers lurking at dawn—except what he had actually seen was armed men, and his certainty about their confession came from years of justified grievance rather than any specific insignia.

The servant had heard de Ségur arguing with a fellow Protestant about betraying the cause—but she had not seen the man, could not name him, and her testimony would be dismissed by both sides as the confusion of an ignorant girl.

Jean touched his fingers in sequence, counting the contradictions. His training said: investigate further, cross-reference, find the inconsistencies that would reveal which account was false. But each account was internally consistent. Each witness believed their own testimony. And each version of events led to a different conclusion about who had killed Henri de Ségur and why.

The rain began as he reached the inn. Jean stabled his horse and climbed the stairs to his room, where his notes lay spread across a table like pieces of a pattern that would not resolve into sense.

This was the work he had built his reputation on: weighing testimony, finding truth beneath the claims of interested parties. He was good at it. He had always been good at it.

But tonight, for the first time in his career, Jean understood with cold clarity that his tools produced only questions. Three witnesses. Three truths. And no way to determine which—if any—matched the thing that had actually occurred on the road where Henri de Ségur had died.

He lit a candle against the gathering dark and began writing his preliminary report. The merchant claims Protestant riders. The farmer claims Catholic soldiers. The servant claims factional conflict within Protestant ranks. Each account plausible. Each account unverifiable.

The pen scratched. The candle burned. And Jean felt the first small crack in the fortress of doubt he had mistaken for wisdom.
