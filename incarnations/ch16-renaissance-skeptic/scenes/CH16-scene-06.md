The ball was held at the residence of Antoine de Pibrac, a nobleman whose wealth derived from wine and whose survival derived from hosting gatherings where both factions could meet under the fiction of social courtesy. Jean arrived as evening settled into full dark, his best doublet brushed clean and his sword worn as much for fashion as function. A man did not attend such events unarmed. Neither did he draw steel unless he wished never to be invited again.

The great hall glittered with candles that cost more than most families spent on food in a season. Musicians played in the gallery. Guests moved in patterns of approach and avoidance choreographed by faction loyalty and social rank. Jean recognized faces from both sides: Catholic League supporters in one cluster, Protestant commanders in another, and between them the politiques who attempted to serve neither faction enough to provoke the other.

He had barely crossed the threshold when Father Michel Sorbin appeared at his elbow.

"Monsieur de Langon. I had hoped we might encounter each other this evening." The priest was perhaps fifty, dressed in the fine black of the clergy but with a bearing that suggested military service in his past. His Latin was impeccable, Jean knew. So was his swordwork.

"Father Sorbin." Jean inclined his head with the precise degree of courtesy owed to a representative of the Church who also served as an agent of Catholic interests. "You honor me with your attention."

"Hardly honor. Merely curiosity." Sorbin's smile was urbane, almost warm, in the way of men who had learned to make courtesy itself a weapon. "The Parlement's investigation proceeds, I trust?"

"It proceeds."

"Slowly, I observe. One might wonder what delays your conclusions."

Jean touched his thumb to his index finger—a small gesture, nearly invisible in the social movement around them. "Thoroughness delays me, Father. The testimony is complex."

"Complex." Sorbin's tone made the word a gentle mockery. "An interesting characterization for what seems rather straightforward. A Protestant notable murdered on a road controlled by Protestant forces, with Catholic soldiers conveniently blamed. One would think the truth rather evident."

"Evidence and truth are not always identical, Father."

"No? How philosophical." Sorbin accepted wine from a passing servant and sipped with appreciation before continuing. "Though I suppose a man educated at the Collège de Guyenne would find epistemological complications where simpler minds see merely facts. Tell me—does your investigation consider the letter?"

Jean's hand stilled on his doublet. "What letter would that be?"

"Come, Monsieur. You have been to see the printer's widow. Documents pass through her establishment as freely as gossip through a marketplace. If there exists evidence of Protestant conspiracy, surely you have encountered it?"

The priest's knowledge was too specific to be speculation. Someone had reported Jean's visit to Marguerite's shop. Someone had known about the letter, or guessed its existence, or manufactured it entirely and now sought to confirm Jean had taken the bait.

"I have encountered many documents," Jean said carefully. "Each requires verification before it can be properly weighted as evidence."

"Verification." Sorbin's smile never wavered. "One imagines verification might prove difficult when the witness is dead and the author unsigned. Perhaps, in such cases, one must rely on judgment rather than perfect certainty. The judgment, for instance, that Protestant commanders had motive to remove an obstacle to their preferred course of war."

"Or the judgment that Catholic interests would benefit from such a letter's existence, whether genuine or manufactured."

"Precisely." The priest's eyes gleamed with something like approval. "You see the difficulty. Each faction has motive to create false evidence. Each accusation serves someone's interest. In such a situation, how does an honest investigator determine truth?"

It was the same question Marguerite had posed, but from Sorbin it carried different weight. The philosopher asked to paralyze. The priest asked to test whether Jean could be turned.

"An honest investigator," Jean said slowly, "reports what he can verify and acknowledges what he cannot. He does not manufacture certainty to satisfy those who demand conclusions."

"How admirable." Sorbin set down his wine glass with deliberate care. "And how dangerous. Men who refuse to choose sides often discover they have made themselves the enemy of both. I do hope, Monsieur, that your thoroughness does not become your epitaph."

The priest moved away into the crowd, his warning delivered with the same urbane courtesy he brought to every interaction. Jean watched him go and felt his ribs ache where the ambush-fighter's dagger had struck leather instead of flesh.

Across the room, Jean saw Captain de Castelnau in conversation with a group of Protestant officers. The Captain's gaze met his briefly—an acknowledgment of presence that carried neither invitation nor threat. Simply a reminder that Protestant interests watched as carefully as Catholic.

Jean moved toward the refreshment tables, seeking space to breathe and think.

A noblewoman passed in a gown of deep yellow silk—the color of late autumn, of fallen leaves, of something else Jean could not name. His throat tightened. For a moment he tasted smoke that was not present, felt heat against his face that the October evening did not explain. The sensation passed before he could examine it, leaving only a faint trembling in his hands and the inexplicable urge to look away from that particular shade of gold. He had no reason to fear yellow fabric. No memory that connected the color to danger. Yet his body had recoiled as if from fire itself.

He had barely reached the wine when a woman's voice spoke at his shoulder.

"You look like a man surrounded by enemies, Monsieur de Langon."

Jean turned. The speaker was Marie de Gramont, a Catholic noblewoman whose husband commanded League forces in the region. She was perhaps forty-five, dressed in silk that proclaimed wealth without ostentation. Her smile was pleasant. Her reputation was for ruthlessness in defense of family interests.

"I am an investigator, Madame. I have no enemies, only subjects of inquiry."

"How diplomatic. And how untrue." She accepted wine from a servant and sipped delicately. "I was present when you were attacked on the road. Not physically, you understand. But I heard of it. Three men—or was it four?—who failed to complete their commission."

"You are well-informed."

"I employ people who keep me well-informed. It is how one survives when one's family holds lands both factions covet." Her eyes—dark, intelligent, evaluating—studied him with the same care Jean brought to witness testimony. "Tell me, Monsieur. When you discover who commissioned that attack, will you include it in your report?"

"If I discover it, and can verify the source, yes."

"Even if the source proves inconvenient to your conclusions about de Ségur's death?"

Jean felt the trap in the question but could not identify its mechanism. "Evidence is evidence, Madame. I do not discard findings because they complicate my narrative."

"Then you are more honest than most investigators." Marie de Gramont's smile deepened. "Or more naive. The attack on your life and the murder of Henri de Ségur might well be connected. Both events serve someone's interests. The question is whose."

She moved away before Jean could respond, leaving him with wine he no longer wanted and a new layer of complexity he had not requested.

The evening ground onward through courses of food and rounds of conversation. Jean navigated the hall like a man crossing a battlefield, aware that every exchange held potential for detonation.

A Catholic merchant asked pointed questions about his timeline. A Protestant officer inquired about his lodgings with concern that sounded like threat. A politique magistrate suggested neutrality might best be served by inconclusive findings that satisfied no one and thus offended no one fatally.

Jean responded to each with careful courtesy and said nothing of substance to anyone. He revealed no conclusions because he had none. He committed to no faction because commitment was the one luxury an investigator could not afford.

But as the evening wore on, Jean began to understand what he had not seen before: his neutrality was being read as position by everyone who encountered it.

The Catholics assumed his caution meant he had found evidence of Protestant guilt but feared to state it directly. They treated him with the careful courtesy reserved for allies who might yet prove useful.

The Protestants assumed his thoroughness meant he was building a case for Catholic conspiracy but needed more evidence to make it undeniable. They watched him with the wary respect due to someone whose final report might vindicate their narrative.

The politiques assumed his inconclusiveness was deliberate strategy—a man who had learned, as they had learned, that the only safe position in Guyenne was the refusal to take any position at all.

All of them were wrong. Or perhaps all of them were right. Jean's neutrality had become a mirror in which every faction saw its own assumptions reflected.

He touched his fingers in sequence—thumb to index, index to middle, middle to ring, ring to small finger—and realized the gesture itself had become performance. The careful investigator weighing evidence. The neutral arbiter considering all sides.

But what if there was no weight to measure? What if the evidence could not be weighed because verification was impossible?

Jean set down his wine glass and moved toward the exit. The ball continued around him—conversation, music, the elaborate dance of faction politics dressed in social forms. He had learned nothing tonight. Or perhaps he had learned everything that mattered: that his investigation was not about finding truth but about producing a report that someone would use as weapon.

Outside, the night air was cool against his face. Jean stood in the courtyard and let the sounds of the ball fade behind him. Above, stars showed clear between clouds. Below, Bordeaux slept uneasily, poised between peace and war, waiting for Jean's report to tip the balance one way or another.

He had perhaps four days remaining before de Lacaze required submission. Four days to determine truth from the wreckage of contradictory testimony and unverifiable documents.

Four days to decide whether honest uncertainty was wisdom or cowardice.

Jean touched his fingers one more time and felt the gesture empty of meaning. He was not weighing evidence. He was counting the days until he would have to choose between truth he could not verify and conclusions he could not honestly claim.

The ball glittered behind him. The road stretched dark ahead. And Jean de Langon stood between them, neutral, thorough, and utterly alone.
