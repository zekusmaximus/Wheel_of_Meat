# Scene 2: The Pattern

---

She had not intended to count. But the pattern was counting itself—intervention after intervention, backfire after backfire, the same mechanism repeating with precision that mocked precision.

Ka's hoarding had taught sharing. Chandra's betrayal had taught trust. Philon's isolation had crystallized wisdom. Verinus's contradictions had taught humility. Macarius's pride had become its own mirror. Kaoru's frozen beauty had melted.

Six incarnations. Six interventions. Six times opposition had accomplished the opposite of what opposition intended.

The thread hummed toward Toledo, toward Diego, toward the personal betrayal she had engineered because personal betrayal should poison personally. Tomás de Mendoza—the name surfaced with the weight of certainty—would denounce the man who had prayed beside him. The denunciation would create hatred. The hatred would bind Diego to the wheel.

Should. Would. The grammar of strategy.

But Lilith's awareness had pulled back from the thread now, settling into her flat where grey light pooled on surfaces she had arranged without remembering the arranging. She was here. Manchester. The present that kept insisting on itself despite the past she inhabited.

*The backfires are structural.*

The recognition arrived as body-knowledge, as the particular settling of weight into her chair. Not failure requiring correction. Not imprecision requiring refinement. The mechanism itself. Opposition accelerated what she opposed because opposition was contact, and contact was intimacy, and intimacy was—

She stopped the thought before it completed.

In Toledo, Sor Catalina moved through streets with absolute certainty. The beata knew her visions were genuine, knew her counsel served God's purpose, knew the Holy Office was mercy made visible to souls too stubborn to see. That certainty had been Lilith's certainty, worn in that body, believed in that time.

She could feel it still. The comfort of conviction.

*I need to focus on my own escape.*

The thought surfaced without permission. She was close—one fetter remaining, the same threshold he approached from a different angle. If every intervention accelerated him, perhaps acceleration was not the variable requiring adjustment. Perhaps the answer was not better opposition but parallel motion.

Racing rather than blocking.

*Getting there first.*

She filed the thought. Strategy. Recalibration. The pattern required new analysis, nothing more.

But the filing felt less secure than filing usually felt, and somewhere beneath the strategy a different question pressed: *What am I racing toward? And why does racing feel like running away?*

She did not answer. The walls were already close enough.

**Word count:** ~398

**Sensory anchors:** Grey light, weight in chair, thread humming
**Integration technique:** Manchester-dominant (60/40), Toledo as echo
**Race consciousness:** First conscious turn—"I need to focus on my own escape"
**Pattern recognition:** Six interventions catalogued, backfires identified as structural
**The parallel:** Sor Catalina's certainty / Lilith's certainty about interventions
**Fetter beat:** Filing fails to fully contain the question
