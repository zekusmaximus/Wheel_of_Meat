Morning broke over the plaza and the plaza was full.

Lilith stood at the crowd's edge in a grey habit, with folded hands, the posture of prayer that Sor Catalina had believed was prayer. Citizens lined the route. Merchants and nobles and peasants with children on their shoulders, come to witness God's justice made visible in flesh and fire.

Seven stakes. Seven condemned. Diego third from the left.

The sanbenito hung from his shoulders like mockery made fabric. Yellow tunic, painted flames, his crimes written in letters large enough to read across the plaza. *Heretic. Judaizer. Relapsed.* The words described a man she had helped create, a fate she had engineered through Tomás's fear and Sor Catalina's certainty and the sustained presence that had been watching him for longer than watching should have required.

Manchester receded to body-echo. Her eyelids heavy, grey light distant, cold ceramic forgotten in hands that were also folded in grey wool against Toledo's November chill.

The hatred. She was waiting for the hatred.

Tomás stood in the crowd hollow-faced, grey, Rafael beside him. The fruit of betrayal. The mechanism working as designed.

Diego's eyes found Tomás.

Lilith leaned forward. In the plaza, in the flat, the same motion of anticipation. This was the moment. The personal betrayal crystallizing into personal poison. Diego would hate, and the hatred would bind, and the wheel would hold what the wheel was meant to hold.

She watched. She waited. She saw—

Release.

Diego looked at Tomás and the ember flickered in his eyes, the poison she had planted, and then a shift happened. His jaw loosened. His hands, bound to the stake, unclenched. The ember went out.

He was *letting go*.

The backfire arrived as physical sensation. Not pain exactly, but a loosening in her own chest that she had not authorized. He was supposed to hate. She had made the betrayal specific so the hatred would be specific. She had engineered this with the precision of seven interventions' accumulated practice.

And he was releasing it. Setting down the coal. Choosing not to carry the poison into death.

*No.*

The denial was silent, internal, immediate. But the denial could not undo what was happening in the plaza, what was completing itself in Diego's face as the torches were lit and the straw began to catch.

Then his eyes found her.

Across the crowd, across the smoke beginning to rise, Diego de Lucena looked at the woman in grey who had watched him since before his arrest. And Lilith felt his gaze land on her face. On the face she wore in every vessel, the face she had worn since she understood that faces could be worn.

His dying eyes held her image.

Widow's peak. Dark strand falling over the left temple. The pale-green crescent in the eye that only appeared in certain light.

*My face.*

The recognition was his body's rather than his mind's. He could not possibly know her, could not name her. He could only understand that the holy woman had been wrong since the first evening she spoke to him outside San Bartolomé. But in the reflection of his dying gaze, she saw herself. Saw the face that had been the same across every incarnation she could remember. Saw the constancy she had never questioned.

*Why am I always the same?*

The question pressed against walls that had no room for it.

He looked at her. And then—

He released her too.

The same loosening that had released Tomás. The same setting-down. She watched it happen in his eyes: the letting-go of the woman who had been wrong, who had watched, who had been part of the machinery consuming him. He released her to whatever purpose she served.

Flames rose. Smoke thickened. His face became difficult to see.

But Lilith had seen enough. Had seen the release she had not asked for, had not wanted, had not known she did not want until the moment he gave it.

She had been seen. And then she had been let go.

The sensation was unlike any backfire before. A feeling like loss wearing strategy's clothing.

He died with peace on his face. He died having released the hatred she had engineered. He died asking a question she could hear burning through the smoke and flame and centuries between them:

*What else can be questioned? What else can be released?*

The question would seed his next life. The question was her failure made manifest.

And beneath the failure, beneath the strategy that had collapsed, something else pressed against her chest:

*He saw me. He released me.*

*Why does release feel like abandonment?*

The flame took him. The crowd watched. Sor Catalina stood with folded hands, her expression grave and pious.

And Lilith, inside the vessel, inside the present that was also past, felt the wheel turn. She understood for the first time, viscerally, in her body rather than her theory, that the wheel was real.

That she had been on it longer than she knew.

That there was a way off.

That the threshold admitted one at a time.

And that he was closer than she had calculated. Closer than strategy could account for.

The smoke rose. The flesh burned. The soul carried forward a question that would become doubt, that would become inquiry, that would become—

She lost the thread as it acceleratated past her, burning brighter than the fire consuming what had been Diego de Lucena.

She was supposed to slow him down.

He was speeding up.
