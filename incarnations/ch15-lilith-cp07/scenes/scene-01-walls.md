The walls had moved closer while she wasn't looking. Her flat—still arranged, still holding its careful beauty from weeks she couldn't count precisely—pressed inward as autumn pressed against Toledo's narrow streets, as persecution pressed against converso households where shutters closed too quickly when shadows passed. She reached for her tea and found it cold, found stone cold beneath sandals she was not wearing, found the grey Manchester light indistinguishable from the grey Toledo dusk that seeped through gaps in wooden doors.

Week six. Or seven. The counting had become imprecise.

Lilith carried the cup to the sink and the motion was also Sor Catalina moving through the converso quarter—grey habit against grey walls, certainty against uncertainty, the stillness of a holy woman whose visions required no justification. She felt the weight of that habit across her shoulders, felt the smooth grain of rosary beads against her palm, felt the conviction that had filled her centuries ago: *confession cleanses. The Holy Office is mercy made visible.*

The conviction arrived as memory. As genuine belief in that body, in that time, with that name she had answered to.

She set the cup in the sink. Water ran cold over ceramic.

In Toledo, evening gathered in the streets like accusation. Windows watching windows. Neighbours cataloguing neighbours. The architecture of suspicion that made every gesture significant, every silence evidence, every prayer potentially the wrong prayer spoken to the wrong god. Diego de Lucena walked through these streets—she could feel him walking, feel his medical bag against his hip, feel the performance of safety he had practiced for forty-three years—and she felt recognition.

His body had recoiled from her.

Diego—the man whose thread she tracked. He had felt Sor Catalina's presence and recoiled without knowing why. Her face, her stillness, the way her eyes looked through surfaces to the secrets beneath.

*My face*, she thought.

The thought dissolved before completion. She was here, in her flat, in Manchester, in the present that was also the past that was also the present. The radiator clicked its inadequate warmth against walls that would not stop closing.

She had walked to the university. Days ago—or weeks. Her body had known where to go when her mind refused to examine the destination. Philosophy faculty. Gothic verticals. The rain on stone.

*He is there.*

Present tense. The thought she kept filing and the filing kept failing.

The walls pressed. Toledo walls, Manchester walls, the walls of her own construction that held the inadmissible separate from the admitted. She was tracking Diego de Lucena, converso physician, faith as performance, service as bargain. She was wearing Sor Catalina like a garment she had worn before, centuries before, and the garment still fit.

The fit was the problem.

She reached for the thread and the thread was already there—incense-thick, blood-warm, carrying the flavour of persecution that tasted the same in any century.

She followed. The walls came with her.
