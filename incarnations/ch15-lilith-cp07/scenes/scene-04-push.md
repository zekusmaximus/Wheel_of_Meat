# Scene 4: The Push

---

The intervention was not Sor Catalina. Sor Catalina was memory—completed action, archived certainty. The intervention was happening now, from this flat, through capabilities that did not require vessels.

Lilith reached.

Her fingers tightened around the cold mug, and somewhere in sixteenth-century Toledo, Tomás de Mendoza woke gasping from a dream of his son's face. Rafael in a cell. Rafael broken. Rafael burning.

She did not create the dream. She found the fear that already lived in Tomás and pressed it closer to his sleeping mind, made the images sharper, made the smell of smoke more real. The Inquisition had arrested Rafael on genuine charges—debts, a brawl—but the Holy Office was patient, and patience could mean anything, and Tomás was old enough to know how easily charges multiplied.

*Your son.*

Not words. Not even thought. Just pressure, applied with the precision of centuries of practice.

*Your son, in their hands. Your son, who could be saved if you provide what they want.*

The cold ceramic against her palm was the cold of Toledo nights, was the cold of cells where prisoners waited for questions that could not be answered correctly. She pushed and the pushing was not effortful—it was the easiest thing she had done in weeks, the cleanest intervention since the frozen spring had shattered around Kaoru.

Personal betrayal. The strategy was sound.

Diego had prayed beside Tomás. Had broken bread at Tomás's table. Had sat shiva with Tomás when his father died, speaking Hebrew prayers in voices barely louder than breath. The knowledge Tomás carried was intimate—not general heresy but specific observance, witnessed, shared, sacred.

When Tomás betrayed that knowledge, Diego would hate him specifically. Not the abstract machinery of persecution but the face of a friend. The poison would be personal.

*Name him. Save your son. Name him and Rafael walks free.*

Lilith pushed, and the pushing felt like competence, felt like finally understanding the variable that previous interventions had missed. Distance had been the problem. Vessels had been the problem. The indirectness of circumstantial manipulation.

This was direct. This was precise. This would work.

She did not examine why precision felt so necessary. Did not ask why this intervention mattered more than others, why she had calculated Tomás's pressure points with an attention that exceeded strategy.

The thread hummed with what was coming. The denunciation. The arrest. The hatred she was engineering.

She pushed, and the walls of her flat pressed close, and somewhere beneath the precision a question she refused to ask pressed closer:

*Why do I need this to work?*

The question dissolved. The mug was cold in her hands. The intervention continued.

**Word count:** ~430

**Sensory anchors:** Cold mug, cold cell, smoke smell (from dream pressure)
**Integration technique:** 40/60 Manchester-dominant; active intervention from present
**Layer 2 intervention:** Pushing Tomás toward betrayal, not witnessing Sor Catalina
**The strategy:** Personal betrayal = personal hatred = binding to wheel
**Fetter beat sharpening:** "I don't feel what I'm feeling"—refuses to examine why this matters
**The parallel (visible to reader):** Her precision mirrors Diego's bargain; her certainty mirrors Sor Catalina's
