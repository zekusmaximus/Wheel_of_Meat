The flat was too small.

She rose from the chair but found no relief. The walls always followed, the ceiling always pressed. The grey light that fell through rain-streaked glass carried the same claustrophobic weight as Toledo's narrow streets, as every enclosure she had tracked and tracked toward.

*Open.*

The word arrived before the memory: Gothic verticals. Victorian gravity softened by November rain. The philosophy faculty emerging from drizzle like an answer to a question she had not asked.

She had walked there. Days ago, or weeks, time had become imprecise in the tracking haze. Her body had known where to go when her mind refused to examine the destination. She had stood in the rain outside buildings where he would be, *was*, present tense, and she had felt—

She lost it before she could name it.

*He is there.*

Not Diego, burning his way toward lessons she was trying to prevent. The other. The contemporary thread. The consciousness that had surfaced into a body that walked those corridors, spoke to students, held office hours while she tracked his past through centuries of accumulated pattern.

She could trace the thread forward. Could find where it surfaced now. Could—

*What if distance is the problem?*

The question pressed against the walls she had built around the inadmissible. Vessels failed. Circumstances failed. Interventions across temporal distance failed and failed and failed.

But if she were *present*. Face to face. Direct contact.

She filed the thought. Returned to the tracking, to Toledo, to the intervention she was still pressing into Tomás's sleeping fear.

But the memory lingered: open sky, wet stone, the possibility of something other than walls.

The flat pressed close. The flat was too small.

And he was somewhere. Present tense. Reachable.
