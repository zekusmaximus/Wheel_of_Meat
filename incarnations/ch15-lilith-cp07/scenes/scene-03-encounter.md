# Scene 3: The Encounter

---

The thread pulled her deeper and the depth was a body she had already worn.

Stone cold beneath sandals that were her sandals, had been her sandals, in a life she had lived before she understood that lives repeated. The shadow of San Bartolomé's western wall fell across grey habit, across folded hands, across the face that watched because watching was what it had always done.

Sor Catalina waited. Lilith waited inside her.

The dislocation was familiar now—not the jarring fracture of early tracking but something stranger, more intimate. She inhabited memory the way one inhabits a room where one has lived: knowing where the furniture sits, which floorboards creak, how the light changes through windows oriented toward particular histories.

She had believed every word.

The recognition surfaced as she watched Diego approach—medical bag against his hip, the performance of ordinary evening, the careful walk of a man who had practiced safety for four decades. In that body, in that time, she had believed the Holy Office was mercy. Had believed confession cleansed the soul. Had believed her visions were God's hand moving through her hands.

*Physician. You walk late.*

Her mouth formed the words—or the memory of her mouth forming words she had already spoken. The sensation was speaking without choosing, utterance as archaeology rather than intention. She felt her lips shape the sounds, felt her tongue press against palate, felt the conviction that filled the syllables even as her present awareness observed the conviction from within.

Diego stopped. His hand found the strap of his medical bag.

She could feel his unease now, from the other side of it. The way his gaze slid toward her and then away, unable to settle. The cold that touched his spine. Something in him—deeper than he knew, older than he could imagine—recognized danger. His body knew what his mind refused.

*He was afraid of me.*

The understanding arrived with a clarity that Toledo's grey light made sharper. In that life, wearing Sor Catalina's certainty like armour, she had not noticed the fear. Had seen only a converso physician whose household required watching, whose friend Tomás required guidance, whose soul required the cleansing she believed herself qualified to provide.

She had believed. The believing had been complete.

*You visited the house of Tomás de Mendoza.*

Her voice, centuries old, speaking words that led toward the denunciation she was engineering. Diego's throat working against reply. His hands—physician's hands, steady hands—beginning to shake.

She had reached toward him. The memory arrived as muscle-echo in her own flat, her own hand moving toward empty air as Sor Catalina's hand had moved toward Diego's arm.

He had recoiled.

She had smiled.

*Walk carefully, physician. These are uncertain times.*

The words dissolved into incense and evening and the particular silence that followed confrontation. Diego walking away, shoulders too straight, back too rigid, body carrying the fear his face refused to show.

She had watched him go. She watched now.

And somewhere beneath the watching, beneath the memory that was also experience, something that was not strategy pressed against the walls she had built around it.

She had *been* there. Speaking. Believing. Causing what came next.

The vessel's hands had been her hands. The vessel's certainty had been her certainty.

The distance between watching and acting had never been as far as she pretended.
