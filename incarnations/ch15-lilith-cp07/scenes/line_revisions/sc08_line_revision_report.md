## 5. Summary Assessment

| Dimension | Rating |
|-----------|--------|
| Voice Consistency | **Weak** |
| Thematic Depth | **Exceptional** |
| **Revision Priority** | **Major** |

### Highest-Impact Revisions
1. **Add 8-10 loaded gestures** (most critical scene)
2. Physical cost of backfire
3. Environmental grounding throughout

---

> **Chapter 15 Summary**: Most variable chapter so far. Scene 4 is HIGH gesture (best in chapter), but scenes 2, 5, 7, 8 all have critical deficits (<15%). Average gesture score: ~12%. The climax and closing scenes need significant embodiment work. Thematic content is exceptional—"Opposition accelerates what I oppose" and "What if I met him directly?" are novel-cornerstone moments.
