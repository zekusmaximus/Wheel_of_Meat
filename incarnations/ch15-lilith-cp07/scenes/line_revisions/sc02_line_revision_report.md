This 47-line scene catalogues backfires. **Critical: gesture at 4.8%** (lowest across all chapters). Pure interiority with no Manchester grounding. **Overall revision priority: Major**.

## 3. Voice Pattern Compliance

| Pattern | Target | Actual | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|

**Only 1 gesture:**
- L15: "settling of weight into her chair"

**Entire scene is disembodied pattern recognition.**

### LINE 25-27: Race Strategy (Preserve)

**Current:**
