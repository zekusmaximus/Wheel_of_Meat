Grey light. Cold ceramic. The flat too small and the walls too close and the thread humming forward toward lives she had not yet tracked.

Lilith opened her eyes. Manchester reasserted itself. The same rain against glass, the same radiator clicking. The exact same arranged objects that she had placed without remembering the placing.

*This intervention worked.*

The thought settled into her chest with a weight that should have felt like victory.

Diego had broken. His equanimity had shattered. His virtue had proven insufficient. His wisdom had become evidence against him. She had watched six iterations of accumulated progress crack under the weight of personal betrayal—watched the ember of hatred ignite in his eyes, watched the poison take hold exactly as she had engineered it.

*He hated. For the first time in all my tracking, I succeeded in making him hate.*

She filed the release—Diego's setting-down of that hatred—as anomaly. The intervention had achieved its purpose. He had experienced specific, personal hatred. The fact that he had then released it was his pattern. Opposition accelerated him. She had known this.

But she had also *broken* him. For the first time, she had succeeded in destroying what he had built.

*The next will be easier.*

The rationalization settled into place. Personal betrayal worked. The method was sound. What she needed was not better opposition but—

She stopped the thought.

Something remained unexamined. The release had been genuine. Diego had set down the hatred she had planted with the same completeness with which he had experienced it. The specificity that should have poisoned him had given him something concrete to examine, to understand, to set down.

*Opposition accelerates what I oppose.*

The recognition was not new. But it was *real* now—visceral, somatic, written in the ache behind her sternum where Diego's dying eyes still looked at her, still reflected her face, still released her without asking permission.

The wheel was real. She had felt it turn. She had felt the centuries of her own circling press against the centuries of his, two threads spiraling toward the same threshold from different angles.

She was close. One knot remaining.

So was he. And he was closing faster.

*What if distance is the problem?*

The thought returned. Louder now. She had worked through vessels, through circumstance, through temporal distance that made every intervention a reaching across a gap that could not be bridged.

But the gap was not necessary. He existed *now*. In Manchester. Walking corridors she could walk, speaking to students she could approach, holding office hours she could—

*What if I met him directly?*

The question was a door. She did not open it. But she saw it now—saw the shape of an approach she had not permitted herself to consider.

Not opposition from distance. Presence. Contact. The intimacy that vessels could only approximate.

She filed the thought. Strategy. Recalibration. The method required adjustment, not the goal.

But beneath the filing, something else stirred. The silence that this work had built around her. The weight of knowledge no one else could share. The wheel turning and turning, and no one to tell that the wheel was real.

*Someone to know.*

The need surfaced before she could suppress it. The first intimation of confession—before she was ready, but present. Someone who understood. Someone who had been there. Someone who could see her face and recognize—

She cut off the thought. Too soon. Too raw. The success did not feel like success was supposed to feel.

But the direction was forming. A different approach: presence instead of opposition, proximity instead of distance, methods that accumulated failure had finally taught her to abandon.

Something else. Something closer. Something that felt less like strategy and more like—

She did not finish the sentence.

She set down the cold tea. Rose from the chair. The walls were still too close, but something had shifted.

Direction rather than decision. Too soon for commitment.

But direction was enough. Direction was the seed of what would grow.

And toward him—always toward him—the thread hummed forward, carrying the question she had not quite asked and the answer she had not yet permitted herself to find.
