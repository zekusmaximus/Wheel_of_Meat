She had not intended to count. But the pattern was counting itself—intervention after intervention, backfire after backfire, the same mechanism repeating with precision that mocked precision.

Ka's hoarding had taught sharing. Chandra's betrayal had taught trust. Philon's isolation had crystallized wisdom. Verinus's contradictions had taught humility. Macarius's pride had become its own mirror. Kaoru's frozen beauty had melted.

And here, in Diego, what the backfires had built.

She followed the thread toward him and felt what the thread carried. Cooperation lived in his body naturally—he consulted with other physicians, shared observations, moved within medical networks without competition. The isolation that had killed Ka was simply absent. When patients arrived without payment, he treated them with the same attention he gave merchants. He gave presence rather than ledger-calculation. The distance that had trapped Chandra had dissolved.

She watched him recognize the Inquisition's epistemological trap without losing himself in despair. The wisdom that had crystallized in Philon—the capacity to see systems while remaining within them—expressed itself now as diagnostic clarity. He maintained ethical standards despite surveillance. The rigidity that had broken Verinus was gone—he acted without waiting for procedural certainty.

And there: genuine humility. He prayed without audience. Maintained faith without display. Macarius's performance had dissolved into something that looked identical to the guilty conscience it mimicked. When his patients died, his hands remained steady. He accepted mortality without attachment, without grasping. Kaoru's frozen grip had released.

Six patterns integrated into behavior before she could observe him struggling.

Her hand stilled on the cold ceramic. The observation she was filing was larger than any she had filed before. Everything the backfires had taught, crystallized into the way this one moved through the world.

She would destroy it.

The thought arrived without permission. Her intervention would work—she was certain of that now. Personal betrayal through intimate knowledge. Tomás had prayed beside Diego, had broken bread at his table, had spoken Hebrew prayers in voices barely louder than breath. When Tomás betrayed that knowledge, the poison would be personal.

But the poison would dissolve what had taken six iterations to build. Cooperation would become isolation—the accused separated from community. Generosity would become evidence—his healing reframed as Judaizing. His wisdom would become proof of forbidden learning. His virtue would prove insufficient against institutional machinery. His humility would become indistinguishable from guilt. His equanimity would shatter when injustice turned personal.

She would destroy something that had taken longer to build than she wanted to admit.

The thought filed as strategy. But something in her chest registered the shape of what she intended.

The shape was not triumph.

It was desecration.

Her hand stilled on the cold ceramic. All the incarnations. All the interventions. All the times opposition had accomplished the opposite of what opposition intended.

The thread hummed toward Toledo, toward Diego, toward the personal betrayal she had engineered because personal betrayal should poison personally. Tomás de Mendoza. The name surfaced with the weight of certainty. He would denounce the man who had prayed beside him. The denunciation would create hatred. The hatred would bind Diego to the wheel.

Should. Would. The grammar of strategy.

But Lilith's awareness had pulled back from the thread now, settling into her flat where grey light pooled on surfaces she had arranged without remembering the arranging. She was here. Manchester. The present that kept insisting on itself despite the past she inhabited.

*The backfires are structural.*

The recognition arrived as body-knowledge, as the settling of weight into her chair. Not failure requiring correction. Not imprecision requiring refinement. The mechanism itself. Opposition accelerated what she opposed because opposition was contact, and contact was intimacy, and intimacy was—

She stopped the thought before it completed.

In Toledo, Sor Catalina moved through streets with absolute certainty. The beata knew her visions were genuine, knew her counsel served God's purpose, knew the Holy Office was mercy made visible to souls too stubborn to see. That certainty had been Lilith's certainty, worn in that body, believed in that time.

She could feel it still. The comfort of conviction.

*I need to focus on my own escape.*

The thought surfaced without permission. She was close—one knot remaining, the final obstruction between herself and completion. The consciousness she tracked approached the same threshold from a different angle. The threshold admitted one at a time. If she got there first—

*What happens to him if I get there first?*

She did not answer. The question was not strategy.

If every intervention accelerated him, perhaps acceleration was not the variable requiring adjustment. Perhaps the answer was not better opposition but parallel motion.

Racing rather than blocking.

*Getting there first.*

She filed the thought. Strategy. Recalibration. The pattern required new analysis, nothing more.

But the filing felt less secure than filing usually felt. Racing implied competition. Competition implied attention. Attention implied—

The shape was almost visible. Racing to escape attachment through attachment. Her final knot—the conceit of being-the-one—tightening while she believed she was loosening it. Every calculation of how to outpace him was a calculation *about him*. Every strategy for parallel motion was a strategy that held him as its reference point.

She could not escape by racing him. She could only race by staying bound.

The recognition pressed against walls that had no room for it.

*What am I racing toward? And why does racing feel like running away?*

She did not answer. The walls were already close enough.
