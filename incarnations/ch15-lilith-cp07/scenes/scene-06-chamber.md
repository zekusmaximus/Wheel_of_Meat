# Scene 6: The Chamber

---

Candlelight on stone walls. The scribe's quill scratching. Incense thick enough to taste—frankincense and myrrh, the Holy Office's particular perfume that covered what needed covering.

She stood in the corner as she had stood in that corner, weeks of standing, watching, the sustained presence that Sor Catalina called prayer and that Lilith called something else. Something she did not name.

Diego sat before the inquisitors. His hands in his lap—steady, the physician's hands, though steadiness cost him something she could feel in her own chest as tightness. As weight.

She had been here for all of it. The arrest. The processing. The visit from Tomás where betrayal became visible, named, specific. She had watched through eyes that were also her eyes, and the watching had been—

*Invested.*

The word surfaced uninvited.

"Did you light candles on Friday evenings?" The inquisitor's voice, gentle as blade-edge. "Did you abstain from pork? Did you speak Hebrew prayers at your father's deathbed?"

Diego's jaw worked. His hands remained steady. But his eyes—his eyes found the corner where Sor Catalina stood, and Lilith felt his gaze land on her face with a weight that was almost physical.

He sensed something. Always had. Something in her stillness, in her watching, in the way her presence pressed against his awareness like cold air through a gap in shuttered windows.

*He sees me.*

Not Sor Catalina. Not the beata offering spiritual comfort. *Her*. The something beneath the vessel that had been the same something across every vessel, every life, every intervention that had failed because—

She cut off the thought. Returned to the watching. The scribe's quill. The candles burning down. The questions that Diego could not answer correctly because no answer existed that would satisfy the machinery designed to consume him.

She had watched this. Was watching this. The sustained presence that exceeded what presence should cost.

*Why am I still here?*

The question filed itself. She was here because the intervention required observation. Because strategy required adjustment. Because—

Because she could not stop watching him.

The admission dissolved before it could complete. But in her flat, in her chair, in the grey light that was always grey now, her chest held the same tightness Diego's hands were costing him.

And she did not know whose tightness it was.
