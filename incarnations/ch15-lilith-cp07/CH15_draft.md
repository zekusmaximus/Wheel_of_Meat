The walls had moved closer while she wasn't looking. Her flat was still arranged. It was still holding its careful beauty from weeks she couldn't count precisely. It pressed inward as autumn pressed against Toledo's narrow streets, as persecution pressed against converso households where shutters closed too quickly when shadows passed. She reached for her tea and found it cold, found stone cold beneath sandals she was not wearing, found the grey Manchester light indistinguishable from the grey Toledo dusk that seeped through gaps in wooden doors.

Week six. Or seven. The counting had become imprecise.

Lilith carried the cup to the sink and the motion was also Sor Catalina moving through the converso quarter. Grey habit against grey walls, certainty against uncertainty, the stillness of a holy woman whose visions required no justification. She felt the weight of that habit across her shoulders, felt the smooth grain of rosary beads against her palm, felt the conviction that had filled her centuries ago: *confession cleanses. The Holy Office is mercy made visible.*

The conviction arrived as memory. As genuine belief in that body, in that time, with that name she had answered to.

She set the cup in the sink. Water ran cold over ceramic.

In Toledo, evening gathered in the streets like accusation. Windows watching windows. Neighbours cataloguing neighbours. The architecture of suspicion that made every gesture significant, every silence evidence, every prayer potentially the wrong prayer spoken to the wrong god. Diego de Lucena walked through these streets. She could feel him walking, feel his medical bag against his hip, feel the performance of safety he had practiced for forty-three years. She also felt recognition.

His body had recoiled from her.

Diego—the man whose thread she tracked. He had felt Sor Catalina's presence and recoiled without knowing why. Her face, her stillness, the way her eyes looked through surfaces to the secrets beneath.

*My face*, she thought.

The thought dissolved before completion. She was here, in her flat, in Manchester, in the present that was also the past that was also the present. The radiator clicked its inadequate warmth against walls that would not stop closing.

She had walked to the university. Days ago, or was it weeks? Her body had known where to go when her mind refused to examine the destination. Philosophy faculty. Gothic verticals. The rain on stone.

*He is there.*

Present tense. The thought she kept filing and the filing kept failing.

The walls pressed. Toledo walls, Manchester walls, the walls of her own construction that held the inadmissible separate from the admitted. She was tracking Diego de Lucena, converso physician, faith as performance, service as bargain. She was wearing Sor Catalina like a garment she had worn before, centuries before, and the garment still fit.

The fit was the problem.

She reached for the thread and the thread was already there incense-thick, blood-warm, carrying the flavour of persecution that tasted the same in any century.

She followed. The walls came with her.

She had not intended to count. But the pattern was counting itself—intervention after intervention, backfire after backfire, the same mechanism repeating with precision that mocked precision.

Ka's hoarding had taught sharing. Chandra's betrayal had taught trust. Philon's isolation had crystallized wisdom. Verinus's contradictions had taught humility. Macarius's pride had become its own mirror. Kaoru's frozen beauty had melted.

And here, in Diego, what the backfires had built.

She followed the thread toward him and felt what the thread carried. Cooperation lived in his body naturally—he consulted with other physicians, shared observations, moved within medical networks without competition. The isolation that had killed Ka was simply absent. When patients arrived without payment, he treated them with the same attention he gave merchants. He gave presence rather than ledger-calculation. The distance that had trapped Chandra had dissolved.

She watched him recognize the Inquisition's epistemological trap without losing himself in despair. The wisdom that had crystallized in Philon—the capacity to see systems while remaining within them—expressed itself now as diagnostic clarity. He maintained ethical standards despite surveillance. The rigidity that had broken Verinus was gone—he acted without waiting for procedural certainty.

And there: genuine humility. He prayed without audience. Maintained faith without display. Macarius's performance had dissolved into something that looked identical to the guilty conscience it mimicked. When his patients died, his hands remained steady. He accepted mortality without attachment, without grasping. Kaoru's frozen grip had released.

Six patterns integrated into behavior before she could observe him struggling.

Her hand stilled on the cold ceramic. The observation she was filing was larger than any she had filed before. Everything the backfires had taught, crystallized into the way this one moved through the world.

She would destroy it.

The thought arrived without permission. Her intervention would work—she was certain of that now. Personal betrayal through intimate knowledge. Tomás had prayed beside Diego, had broken bread at his table, had spoken Hebrew prayers in voices barely louder than breath. When Tomás betrayed that knowledge, the poison would be personal.

But the poison would dissolve what had taken six iterations to build. Cooperation would become isolation—the accused separated from community. Generosity would become evidence—his healing reframed as Judaizing. His wisdom would become proof of forbidden learning. His virtue would prove insufficient against institutional machinery. His humility would become indistinguishable from guilt. His equanimity would shatter when injustice turned personal.

She would destroy something that had taken longer to build than she wanted to admit.

The thought filed as strategy. But something in her chest registered the shape of what she intended.

The shape was not triumph.

It was desecration.

Her hand stilled on the cold ceramic. All the incarnations. All the interventions. All the times opposition had accomplished the opposite of what opposition intended.

The thread hummed toward Toledo, toward Diego, toward the personal betrayal she had engineered because personal betrayal should poison personally. Tomás de Mendoza. The name surfaced with the weight of certainty. He would denounce the man who had prayed beside him. The denunciation would create hatred. The hatred would bind Diego to the wheel.

Should. Would. The grammar of strategy.

But Lilith's awareness had pulled back from the thread now, settling into her flat where grey light pooled on surfaces she had arranged without remembering the arranging. She was here. Manchester. The present that kept insisting on itself despite the past she inhabited.

*The backfires are structural.*

The recognition arrived as body-knowledge, as the settling of weight into her chair. Not failure requiring correction. Not imprecision requiring refinement. The mechanism itself. Opposition accelerated what she opposed because opposition was contact, and contact was intimacy, and intimacy was—

She stopped the thought before it completed.

In Toledo, Sor Catalina moved through streets with absolute certainty. The beata knew her visions were genuine, knew her counsel served God's purpose, knew the Holy Office was mercy made visible to souls too stubborn to see. That certainty had been Lilith's certainty, worn in that body, believed in that time.

She could feel it still. The comfort of conviction.

*I need to focus on my own escape.*

The thought surfaced without permission. She was close—one knot remaining, the final obstruction between herself and completion. The consciousness she tracked approached the same threshold from a different angle. The threshold admitted one at a time. If she got there first—

*What happens to him if I get there first?*

She did not answer. The question was not strategy.

If every intervention accelerated him, perhaps acceleration was not the variable requiring adjustment. Perhaps the answer was not better opposition but parallel motion.

Racing rather than blocking.

*Getting there first.*

She filed the thought. Strategy. Recalibration. The pattern required new analysis, nothing more.

But the filing felt less secure than filing usually felt. Racing implied competition. Competition implied attention. Attention implied—

The shape was almost visible. Racing to escape attachment through attachment. Her final knot—the conceit of being-the-one—tightening while she believed she was loosening it. Every calculation of how to outpace him was a calculation *about him*. Every strategy for parallel motion was a strategy that held him as its reference point.

She could not escape by racing him. She could only race by staying bound.

The recognition pressed against walls that had no room for it.

*What am I racing toward? And why does racing feel like running away?*

She did not answer. The walls were already close enough.

The thread pulled her deeper and the depth was a body she had already worn.

Stone cold beneath sandals that were her sandals, had been her sandals, in a life she had lived before she understood that lives repeated. The shadow of San Bartolomé's western wall fell across grey habit, across folded hands, across the face that watched because watching was what it had always done.

Sor Catalina waited. Lilith waited inside her.

The dislocation was familiar now, not the jarring fracture of early tracking but something stranger, more intimate. She inhabited memory the way one inhabits a room where one has lived: knowing where the furniture sits, which floorboards creak, how the light changes through windows oriented toward particular histories.

She had believed every word.

The recognition surfaced as she watched Diego approach. His medical bag against his hip, the performance of ordinary evening, the careful walk of a man who had practiced safety for four decades. In that body, in that time, she had believed the Holy Office was mercy. Had believed confession cleansed the soul. Had believed her visions were God's hand moving through her hands.

*Physician. You walk late.*

Her mouth formed the words, or the memory of her mouth forming words she had already spoken. The sensation was speaking without choosing, utterance as archaeology rather than intention. She felt her lips shape the sounds, felt her tongue press against palate, felt the conviction that filled the syllables even as her present awareness observed the conviction from within.

Diego stopped. His hand found the strap of his medical bag.

She could feel his unease now, from the other side of it. The way his gaze slid toward her and then away, unable to settle. The cold that touched his spine. Something deep and old within recognized danger. His body knew what his mind refused.

*He was afraid of me.*

The understanding arrived with a clarity that Toledo's grey light made sharper. In that life, wearing Sor Catalina's certainty like armour, she had not noticed the fear. Had seen only a converso physician whose household required watching, whose friend Tomás required guidance, whose soul required the cleansing she believed herself qualified to provide.

She had believed. The believing had been complete.

*You visited the house of Tomás de Mendoza.*

Her voice, centuries old, speaking words that led toward the denunciation she was engineering. Diego's throat working against reply. His physician's hands, steady hands, beginning to shake.

She had reached toward him. The memory arrived as muscle-echo in her own flat, her own hand moving toward empty air as Sor Catalina's hand had moved toward Diego's arm.

He had recoiled.

She had smiled.

*Walk carefully, physician. These are uncertain times.*

The words dissolved into incense and evening and the particular silence that followed confrontation. Diego walking away, shoulders too straight, back too rigid, body carrying the fear his face refused to show.

She had watched him go. She watched now.

And somewhere beneath the watching, beneath the memory that was also experience, something that was not strategy pressed against the walls she had built around it.

She had *been* there. Speaking. Believing. Causing what came next.

The vessel's hands had been her hands. The vessel's certainty had been her certainty.

The distance between watching and acting had never been as far as she pretended.

The intervention was not Sor Catalina. Sor Catalina was completed action, archived certainty. The intervention was happening now, from this flat, through capabilities that did not require vessels.

Lilith reached.

Her fingers tightened around the cold mug, and somewhere in sixteenth-century Toledo, Tomás de Mendoza woke gasping from a dream of his son's face. Rafael in a cell. Rafael broken. Rafael burning.

She did not create the dream. She found the fear that already lived in Tomás and pressed it closer to his sleeping mind, made the images sharper, made the smell of smoke more real. The Inquisition had arrested Rafael on genuine charges—debts, a brawl certainly, but the Holy Office was patient, and patience could mean anything, and Tomás was old enough to know how easily charges multiplied.

*Your son.*

Not words. Not even thought. Just pressure, applied with the precision of centuries of practice.

*Your son, in their hands. Your son, who could be saved if you provide what they want.*

The cold ceramic against her palm was the cold of Toledo nights, was the cold of cells where prisoners waited for questions that could not be answered correctly. She pushed and the easiest thing she had done in weeks, the cleanest intervention since the frozen spring had shattered around Kaoru.

Personal betrayal. The strategy was sound.

Diego had prayed beside Tomás. Had broken bread at Tomás's table. Had sat shiva with Tomás when his father died, speaking Hebrew prayers in voices barely louder than breath. The knowledge Tomás carried was intimate—not general heresy but specific observance, witnessed, shared, sacred.

When Tomás betrayed that knowledge, Diego would hate him specifically. Not the abstract machinery of persecution but the face of a friend. The poison would be personal.

*Name him. Save your son. Name him and Rafael walks free.*

Lilith pushed, and the pushing felt like competence, felt like finally understanding the variable that previous interventions had missed. Distance had been the problem. Vessels had been the problem. The indirectness of circumstantial manipulation.

This was direct. This was precise. This would work.

She did not examine why precision felt so necessary. Did not ask why this intervention mattered more than others, why she had calculated Tomás's pressure points with an attention that exceeded strategy.

The thread hummed with what was coming. The denunciation. The arrest. The hatred she was engineering.

She pushed, and the walls of her flat pressed close, and somewhere beneath the precision a question she refused to ask pressed closer:

*Why do I need this to work?*

The question dissolved. The mug was cold in her hands. The intervention continued.

The flat was too small.

She rose from the chair but found no relief. The walls always followed, the ceiling always pressed. The grey light that fell through rain-streaked glass carried the same claustrophobic weight as Toledo's narrow streets, as every enclosure she had tracked and tracked toward.

*Open.*

The word arrived before the memory: Gothic verticals. Victorian gravity softened by November rain. The philosophy faculty emerging from drizzle like an answer to a question she had not asked.

She had walked there. Days ago, or weeks, time had become imprecise in the tracking haze. Her body had known where to go when her mind refused to examine the destination. She had stood in the rain outside buildings where he would be, *was*, present tense, and she had felt—

She lost it before she could name it.

*He is there.*

Not Diego, burning his way toward lessons she was trying to prevent. The other. The contemporary thread. The consciousness that had surfaced into a body that walked those corridors, spoke to students, held office hours while she tracked his past through centuries of accumulated pattern.

She could trace the thread forward. Could find where it surfaced now. Could—

*What if distance is the problem?*

The question pressed against the walls she had built around the inadmissible. Vessels failed. Circumstances failed. Interventions across temporal distance failed and failed and failed.

But if she were *present*. Face to face. Direct contact.

She filed the thought. Returned to the tracking, to Toledo, to the intervention she was still pressing into Tomás's sleeping fear.

But the memory lingered: open sky, wet stone, the possibility of something other than walls.

The flat pressed close. The flat was too small.

And he was somewhere. Present tense. Reachable.

Candlelight on stone walls. The scribe's quill scratching. Incense thick enough to taste, Frankincense and myrrh, the Holy Office's particular perfume that covered what needed covering.

She stood in the corner as she had stood in that corner, weeks of standing, watching, the sustained presence that Sor Catalina called prayer and that Lilith called something else. Something she did not name.

Diego sat before the inquisitors. His hands steady in his lap. A physician's hands, though steadiness cost him something she could feel in her own chest as tightness. As weight.

She had been here for all of it. The arrest. The processing. The visit from Tomás where betrayal became visible, named, specific. She had watched through eyes that were also her eyes, and the watching had been—

*Invested.*

The word surfaced uninvited.

"Did you light candles on Friday evenings?" The inquisitor's voice, gentle as blade-edge. "Did you abstain from pork? Did you speak Hebrew prayers at your father's deathbed?"

Diego's jaw worked. His hands remained steady. But his eyes—his eyes found the corner where Sor Catalina stood, and Lilith felt his gaze land on her face with a weight that was almost physical.

He sensed something. Always had. Something in her stillness, in her watching, in the way her presence pressed against his awareness like cold air through a gap in shuttered windows.

*He sees me.*

Not Sor Catalina. Not the beata offering spiritual comfort. *Her*. The something beneath the vessel that had been the same something across every vessel, every life, every intervention that had failed because—

She cut off the thought. Returned to the watching. The scribe's quill. The candles burning down. The questions that Diego could not answer correctly because no answer existed that would satisfy the machinery designed to consume him.

She had watched this. Was watching this. The sustained presence that exceeded what presence should cost.

*Why am I still here?*

The question filed itself. She was here because the intervention required observation. Because strategy required adjustment. Because—

Because she could not stop watching him.

The admission dissolved before it could complete.

And there—in his physician's hands held steady despite questions with no correct answers—she saw the parallel she would not name. Diego believed being useful would protect him. Had believed it through every consultation, every treatment, every diagnosis offered to a system that would consume him regardless of what he offered.

*He cannot stop healing even when his healing serves the machinery consuming him.*

The observation arrived with the precision of diagnosis.

And beneath the observation, something she would not examine: *I cannot stop watching even when my watching accelerates him.*

His bargain: service in exchange for safety. Her bargain: precision in exchange for victory. The same belief that control could be purchased through expertise. The same hands working at tasks that had ceased to accomplish what they intended.

Diego's bargain had failed. His usefulness had not protected him.

And her precision—

She filed the thought. Strategy did not require comparison.

But in her flat, in her chair, in the grey light that was always grey now, her chest held the same tightness Diego's hands were costing him.

And she did not know whose tightness it was.

Morning broke over the plaza and the plaza was full.

Lilith stood at the crowd's edge in a grey habit, with folded hands, the posture of prayer that Sor Catalina had believed was prayer. Citizens lined the route. Merchants and nobles and peasants with children on their shoulders, come to witness God's justice made visible in flesh and fire.

Seven stakes. Seven condemned. Diego third from the left.

The sanbenito hung from his shoulders like mockery made fabric. Yellow tunic, painted flames, his crimes written in letters large enough to read across the plaza. *Heretic. Judaizer. Relapsed.* The words described a man she had helped create, a fate she had engineered through Tomás's fear and Sor Catalina's certainty and the sustained presence that had been watching him for longer than watching should have required.

Manchester receded to body-echo. Her eyelids heavy, grey light distant, cold ceramic forgotten in hands that were also folded in grey wool against Toledo's November chill.

The hatred. She was waiting for the hatred.

Tomás stood in the crowd hollow-faced, grey, Rafael beside him. The fruit of betrayal. The mechanism working as designed.

Diego's eyes found Tomás.

Lilith leaned forward. In the plaza, in the flat, the same motion of anticipation. This was the moment. The personal betrayal crystallizing into personal poison.

She watched. She waited.

And she saw it.

Diego's face contorted. The ember of rage igniting, the poison she had planted catching fire. His jaw clenched. His bound hands became fists. The ember burned in his eyes as he looked at the man who had betrayed him—the friend who had prayed beside him, broken bread at his table, spoken Hebrew prayers in voices barely louder than breath.

*Yes.*

The word was silent, internal, fierce.

*He's breaking.*

After all the backfires, all the acceleration she hadn't intended, this intervention had *worked*. Diego was experiencing hatred—specific, personal, intimate hatred. The kind that bound the hater to the wheel as surely as iron chains.

Something in her chest that should have felt like triumph felt like—

She filed the feeling. Strategy did not require naming.

But watching Diego's face twist with the hatred she had engineered—watching the six patterns of accumulated progress crack under the weight of personal betrayal—

The horror arrived before the triumph could settle.

Cooperation shattered into isolation. Generosity reframed as evidence. Wisdom become proof of forbidden learning. Virtue insufficient against institutional machinery. Humility indistinguishable from guilt. Equanimity broken against injustice to self.

*What I destroyed was beautiful.*

She had watched six iterations of accumulated progress crystallize into this consciousness. Had watched something that approached what she had spent her own iterations pursuing. And she had destroyed it with a precision she had cultivated for exactly this purpose.

The thought filed as strategy. Sentiment. The intervention had worked. That was what mattered.

Then Diego looked at Tomás again.

And the ember... flickered. Dimmed.

His jaw loosened. His hands, bound to the stake, unclenched.

*No.*

The ember went out. He was *letting go*.

Release.

The backfire arrived as physical sensation. Not pain exactly, but a loosening in her own chest that she had not authorized. He was supposed to hate. She had *made* him hate. She had watched the hatred ignite.

And he was releasing it. Setting down the coal. Choosing not to carry the poison into death.

The denial was silent, internal, immediate. But the denial could not undo what was happening in the plaza, what was completing itself in Diego's face as the torches were lit and the straw began to catch.

Then his eyes found her.

Across the crowd, across the smoke beginning to rise, Diego de Lucena looked at the woman in grey who had watched him since before his arrest. And Lilith felt his gaze land on her face. On the face she wore in every vessel, the face she had worn since she understood that faces could be worn.

His dying eyes held her image.

Widow's peak. Dark strand falling over the left temple. The pale-green crescent in the eye that only appeared in certain light.

*My face.*

*Always my face.*

The recognition was his body's rather than his mind's. He could not possibly know her, could not name her. He could only understand that the holy woman had been wrong since the first evening she spoke to him outside San Bartolomé. But in the reflection of his dying gaze, she saw herself. Saw the face that had been the same across every incarnation she could remember. Saw the constancy she had never questioned.

*Why am I always the same?*

She had tracked him through Ka's isolation, through Chandra's ledgers, through Philon's teaching, through Verinus's precision, through Macarius's performance, through Kaoru's frozen grasping. Different bodies. Different voices. Different faces. He changed every time. Arrived in new flesh, learned new lessons, made new mistakes.

And she was always the same. The same widow's peak. The same dark strand. The same pale-green crescent that appeared only in certain light.

*Why do I stay constant while he changes?*

*How close am I to the threshold?*

*What remains that I haven't set down?*

The questions pressed against walls that had no room for them. She filed them. She did not answer.

He looked at her. And then—

He released her too.

The same loosening that had released Tomás. The same setting-down. She watched it happen in his eyes: the letting-go of the woman who had been wrong, who had watched, who had been part of the machinery consuming him. He released her to whatever purpose she served.

Flames rose. Smoke thickened. His face became difficult to see.

But Lilith had seen enough. Had seen the release she had not asked for, had not wanted, had not known she did not want until the moment he gave it.

She had been seen. And then she had been let go.

The sensation was unlike any backfire before. A feeling like loss wearing strategy's clothing.

He died with peace on his face. He died having released the hatred she had engineered. He died carrying a question she could hear burning through the smoke and flame and centuries between them:

*That hatred was a choice. That release was possible. That everything—everything—could be questioned.*

The question would seed his next life. She had broken him, and in the breaking he had discovered what endurance could teach—what destruction could crystallize when destruction was met with examination rather than resistance.

The question was her failure made manifest. But she could not see what the failure had produced.

And beneath the failure, beneath the strategy that had collapsed, something else pressed against her chest:

*He saw me. He released me.*

*Why does release feel like abandonment?*

The flame took him. The crowd watched. Sor Catalina stood with folded hands, her expression grave and pious.

And Lilith, inside the vessel, inside the present that was also past, felt the wheel turn. She understood for the first time, viscerally, in her body rather than her theory, that the wheel was real.

That she had been on it longer than she knew.

That there was a way off.

That the threshold admitted one at a time.

And that he was closer than she had calculated. Closer than strategy could account for.

The smoke rose. The flesh burned. The soul carried forward a question that would become doubt, that would become inquiry, that would become—

She lost the thread as it accelerated past her, burning brighter than the fire consuming what had been Diego de Lucena.

She was supposed to slow him down.

He was speeding up.

Grey light. Cold ceramic. The flat too small and the walls too close and the thread humming forward toward lives she had not yet tracked.

Lilith opened her eyes. Manchester reasserted itself. The same rain against glass, the same radiator clicking. The exact same arranged objects that she had placed without remembering the placing.

*This intervention worked.*

The thought settled into her chest with a weight that should have felt like victory.

Diego had broken. His equanimity had shattered. His virtue had proven insufficient. His wisdom had become evidence against him. She had watched six iterations of accumulated progress crack under the weight of personal betrayal—watched the ember of hatred ignite in his eyes, watched the poison take hold exactly as she had engineered it.

*He hated. For the first time in all my tracking, I succeeded in making him hate.*

She filed the release—Diego's setting-down of that hatred—as anomaly. The intervention had achieved its purpose. He had experienced specific, personal hatred. The fact that he had then released it was his pattern. Opposition accelerated him. She had known this.

But she had also *broken* him. For the first time, she had succeeded in destroying what he had built.

*The next will be easier.*

The rationalization settled into place. Personal betrayal worked. The method was sound. What she needed was not better opposition but—

She stopped the thought.

Something remained unexamined. The release had been genuine. Diego had set down the hatred she had planted with the same completeness with which he had experienced it. The specificity that should have poisoned him had given him something concrete to examine, to understand, to set down.

*Opposition accelerates what I oppose.*

The recognition was not new. But it was *real* now—visceral, somatic, written in the ache behind her sternum where Diego's dying eyes still looked at her, still reflected her face, still released her without asking permission.

The wheel was real. She had felt it turn. She had felt the centuries of her own circling press against the centuries of his, two threads spiraling toward the same threshold from different angles.

She was close. One knot remaining.

So was he. And he was closing faster.

*What if distance is the problem?*

The thought returned. Louder now. She had worked through vessels, through circumstance, through temporal distance that made every intervention a reaching across a gap that could not be bridged.

But the gap was not necessary. He existed *now*. In Manchester. Walking corridors she could walk, speaking to students she could approach, holding office hours she could—

*What if I met him directly?*

The question was a door. She did not open it. But she saw it now—saw the shape of an approach she had not permitted herself to consider.

Not opposition from distance. Presence. Contact. The intimacy that vessels could only approximate.

She filed the thought. Strategy. Recalibration. The method required adjustment, not the goal.

But beneath the filing, something else stirred. The silence that this work had built around her. The weight of knowledge no one else could share. The wheel turning and turning, and no one to tell that the wheel was real.

*Someone to know.*

The need surfaced before she could suppress it. The first intimation of confession—before she was ready, but present. Someone who understood. Someone who had been there. Someone who could see her face and recognize—

She cut off the thought. Too soon. Too raw. The success did not feel like success was supposed to feel.

But the direction was forming. A different approach: presence instead of opposition, proximity instead of distance, methods that accumulated failure had finally taught her to abandon.

Something else. Something closer. Something that felt less like strategy and more like—

She did not finish the sentence.

She set down the cold tea. Rose from the chair. The walls were still too close, but something had shifted.

Direction rather than decision. Too soon for commitment.

But direction was enough. Direction was the seed of what would grow.

And toward him—always toward him—the thread hummed forward, carrying the question she had not quite asked and the answer she had not yet permitted herself to find.
