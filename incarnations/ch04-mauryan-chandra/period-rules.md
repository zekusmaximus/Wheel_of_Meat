## Historical Constraints

### Available Technology
- Writing on palm leaves, birch bark
- Seal rings for authentication
- Courier systems (messengers, not post)
- Accounting with counting boards
- No paper (not yet introduced to India)

### Social Structure
- Mauryan bureaucracy: highly organized, merit-based elements
- Caste system in flux during Ashokan reforms
- Buddhist sangha growing in influence
- District administrators (like Chandra) wielded significant local power

### Material Culture
- Architecture: stone and brick; Ashokan pillars
- Clothing: draped garments, regional variations
- Food: rice, lentils, vegetables; meat consumption declining under Ashoka's influence
- Currency: punch-marked coins

### Religious/Philosophical Context
- Ashoka's dhamma: non-violence, tolerance, welfare
- Buddhism spreading but not yet dominant
- Brahmanical traditions still strong
- Tension between old ways and new reforms

## Language Rules

### Forbidden Anachronisms
- No mention of: paper, printing, tea, later inventions
- No modern bureaucratic jargon
- No British-Raj-era terminology
- No words derived from Arabic (not yet present in Indian languages)

### Vocabulary Guidance
- Use Sanskrit-derived terms where appropriate
- Titles: avoid "king" (use "raja" or describe), avoid "emperor" (describe Ashoka's position)
- Administrative terms: keep period-appropriate or describe functionally
- Religious terms: Buddhist terminology fine if natural to context

### Dialogue Style
- Formal register for official interactions
- More direct in private moments
- Proverbs and aphorisms appropriate
- No contractions

## Chandra - Avatar Profile

### Name Meaning
Chandra = "moon" (Sanskrit); common name, appropriate to merchant background

### Position
District administrator (a significant post in Mauryan bureaucracy)

### Background
Former merchant who rose through administrative competence

### The Compulsive Helper Manifestation
Chandra's version of the soul's core flaw: he helps through *systems*. He believes that if he can get the numbers right, the administration correct, the resources properly allocated, he can save everyone. He gives resources but not himself. He is present in the ledger but absent from the suffering.

### Fatal Flaw
When crisis comes, he focuses on saving the records—the proof of what he's done—while people burn. The ledger becomes more real to him than the flesh.

### Core Attachment
"Merchant mindset"—sees people as numbers, suffering as data to be optimized

## Lilith in This Chapter

### Power Level
Learning to focus visions; can influence through intermediaries

### Method
Influences trusted colleague Devaka, causing betrayal that compromises Chandra's investigation

### Possible Manifestations
- A figure Chandra glimpses but can't place
- Dreams that seem prophetic but mislead
- Devaka acting slightly out of character (subtle—Chandra might not notice)

### Objective This Chapter
[TBD - what is she trying to accomplish?]

---

## Lesson: Generosity (Incomplete)

### What Chandra Learns
The form of generosity—giving resources, time, administrative effort

### What He Fails to Learn
True generosity requires giving of the self, not just the surplus. He remains behind his ledger.

### Death Should Seed
[TBD - how does his death set up Chapter 6's altruism lesson?]

---

## Scene Requirements

Every scene in this chapter should:
1. Feel like a political thriller (tension, stakes, information asymmetry)
2. Show Chandra's relationship to numbers/systems
3. Ground reader in Mauryan material culture (but don't infodump)
4. Include at least one meat/body theme element
5. Subtly include soul recognition markers
6. If Lilith appears/acts, stay within her power level
