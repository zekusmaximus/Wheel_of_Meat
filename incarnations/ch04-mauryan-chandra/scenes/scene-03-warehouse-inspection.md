The granary complex sprawled along the riverbank like a creature built for consumption—twelve warehouses arranged in staggered rows, their brick foundations rising from the alluvial mud, their thatch roofs sloping toward drainage channels that carried monsoon water back to the Ganges. I stood at the main gate as the morning sun climbed toward its zenith, my wounded arm aching beneath fresh bandages, and counted the structures by capacity. Forty thousand measures total storage, assuming standard packing density. Enough grain to feed the district for three months, or to fund a conspiracy large enough to warrant killing a Dharma-Mahāmātra.

The guards at the gate had examined my authority documents with the particular slowness of men accustomed to delaying visitors until their superiors could be notified. I had waited, watching the activity within the compound—laborers carrying sacks between buildings, clerks moving with palm-leaf bundles clutched against their chests, a supervisor gesturing emphatically at a cart driver who had positioned his vehicle in some unacceptable manner. The rhythms were familiar. I had spent twelve years in similar compounds before accepting the emperor's service, learning to read the flow of goods and people the way other men learned to read faces.

Devaka arrived as the guards finally waved me through, his approach marked by the soft scuff of sandals on packed earth. He carried a cotton satchel heavy with documents—the records I had requested, delivered ahead of schedule.

"Warehouse Seven's loss reports for the past eighteen months," he said, falling into step beside me. "Transportation logs, personnel records, and the original harvest assessments from the collection points."

I took the satchel with my good hand, feeling its weight settle against my hip. The strap cut into my shoulder, a small discomfort I catalogued and dismissed. "Any difficulties obtaining them?"

"The warehouse keeper was reluctant to release the originals. I reminded him that the Pradeshika's seal entitled us to whatever documents we required." Devaka's voice carried a note of satisfaction that I recognized from our merchant days, when a difficult negotiation had concluded in our favor. "He became cooperative."

We walked deeper into the compound, past the first row of warehouses where laborers loaded sacks onto waiting carts. The smell hit me before I fully registered its components—grain dust thick enough to taste, the sharp undertone of rat droppings, the organic sweetness of stored rice beginning to heat in the poorly ventilated structures. Beneath it all, the river's presence asserted itself, a damp mineral note that permeated everything within a thousand paces of the water.

I had grown up with these smells. My father had managed a smaller granary in the eastern provinces, and my earliest memories involved the particular quality of light filtering through thatch gaps onto mountains of grain sacks. The familiarity should have been comforting. Instead, I found myself parsing each scent for evidence of wrongdoing—mold that might indicate deliberate spoilage, chemical additives used to mask inferior grain, the absence of proper fumigation.

Warehouse Seven occupied the northeastern corner of the compound, its position affording easy access to the river docks where grain shipments arrived and departed. The building was larger than its neighbors, with higher walls and a reinforced roof that suggested it had been expanded at some point after its original construction. I estimated the modification cost at two hundred karshapanas, possibly more depending on the quality of materials used.

The warehouse keeper emerged as we approached, a heavyset man with the particular pallor of someone who spent his days in dim storage spaces. His name, according to Devaka's personnel records, was Vikram—a former guild accountant who had entered government service six years prior on the recommendation of a senior merchant whose name I did not recognize.

"Rājuka Chandra." Vikram performed the gesture of respect with hands that trembled slightly, though whether from age or apprehension I could not determine. "I was informed you would be inspecting our facilities. We are honored by your attention."

The words were correct. The delivery suggested a man who had rehearsed them while waiting for our arrival.

"The inspection will be thorough," I said. "I will require access to all storage areas, all documentation, and any personnel who can speak to the handling procedures for incoming and outgoing shipments."

Vikram's hands continued their subtle tremor as he led us into the warehouse's dim interior. The transition from sunlight to shadow momentarily blinded me, and I paused at the threshold while my eyes adjusted. The space resolved gradually—rows of grain sacks stacked to head height, narrow aisles between the rows barely wide enough for two men to pass, palm-leaf inventory markers hanging from pegs driven into the support posts.

The smell intensified inside, grain dust coating my tongue with each breath. I tasted it consciously now, analyzing its composition the way I had learned to evaluate grain quality in my father's warehouses. Rice predominated, with undertones of millet and the faint bitterness of older stores beginning to degrade. Nothing obviously wrong, nothing that would raise immediate suspicion.

I walked the aisles slowly, running my good hand along the sacks as I passed. The burlap was rough beneath my fingers, the weave consistent with standard imperial issue. Each sack bore a wax seal stamped with the warehouse's identification mark and the date of receipt. The seals appeared intact, properly applied, showing no evidence of tampering.

The numbers on the inventory markers matched the figures in Nagasena's preliminary report—or rather, they matched the figures that had been reported to Nagasena. Eight hundred sacks in the first row, seven hundred in the second, the totals declining toward the rear of the warehouse where older stores awaited distribution or disposal.

I stopped before a stack in the fourth row, where the inventory marker claimed six hundred and forty-two sacks of first-quality rice received from the Vaishali collection point three months prior. The sacks were arranged properly, aligned with the care that imperial regulations demanded. Their seals bore the correct stamps.

But the weight was wrong.

I had not consciously decided to test the sacks. My hand simply closed on the nearest one, fingers pressing into the burlap with the automatic assessment I had developed over twelve years of merchant work. A standard drona of first-quality rice weighed fourteen kilograms, its density consistent enough that experienced handlers could estimate a sack's contents by feel alone. I had performed this evaluation thousands of times, in warehouses across three provinces, until the knowledge had settled into my body like a second language.

This sack weighed perhaps twelve kilograms. Possibly less.

I lifted a second sack, then a third. The weight discrepancy held consistent—each measure approximately fifteen percent lighter than it should have been. Not enough to notice during casual handling, when laborers moved dozens of sacks per hour and seldom paused to consider individual weights. Enough to represent a significant shortage if multiplied across an entire warehouse.

"These sacks." I kept my voice neutral, a merchant's technique for obtaining information without revealing the value of what I already knew. "They were received from Vaishali three months ago?"

Vikram's hands had stopped trembling. His face had settled into an expression of careful attention, the look of a man preparing to explain something uncomfortable. "Yes, Rājuka. The shipment arrived on schedule, properly documented. We inspected a random sample upon receipt, as regulations require."

"And the inspection found no irregularities?"

"None that were recorded."

I set down the sack I was holding and withdrew my knife from its sheath at my belt. The blade caught the dim light filtering through gaps in the thatch, and I watched Vikram's expression flicker—not toward fear, but toward something more calculated. Anticipation, perhaps. Or resignation.

The wax seal parted beneath my knife with a soft crack. I spread the burlap opening and thrust my hand into the grain within, feeling the individual kernels shift around my fingers. The texture was wrong before I even withdrew a sample. First-quality rice should flow like water, each grain smooth and uniform. This moved sluggishly, with the resistance of mixed materials settling against each other.

I pulled out a handful and examined it in the light from the doorway. Rice, yes—but perhaps half the expected proportion. The remainder was millet, inferior grain worth perhaps a quarter of rice's market value, mixed with sufficient skill that casual inspection would not reveal the substitution.

The conspiracy crystallized in my mind with the clarity of a completed calculation. Grain arriving at the warehouse in proper quantities, properly documented, properly sealed. Grain leaving for distribution with the same documentation, the same seals—but lighter, diluted, worth a fraction of what the records claimed. The difference skimmed off and sold through channels that would not ask questions about provenance.

Fifteen percent lighter across twelve warehouses, over eighteen months of operation. I ran the numbers automatically, my mind performing the arithmetic while my hand still held the evidence of fraud. Twelve to fifteen thousand measures diverted, at minimum. Enough grain to feed a district. Enough profit to purchase loyalty, silence, protection at the highest levels.

"The Vaishali shipment." I let the mixed grain fall back into the sack, watching the kernels scatter across the burlap. "Who signed for its receipt?"

Vikram's expression had completed its transition from careful attention to something harder to read—not quite defiance, not quite surrender. "I did, Rājuka. As I sign for all shipments received at this facility."

"And the quality inspection?"

"Performed by my staff, as regulations require."

I looked at the sack before me, its violated seal now obvious evidence of tampering. I looked at Vikram, whose trembling hands had steadied into the posture of a man preparing to defend himself. I looked at Devaka, standing three paces behind me with an expression I could not interpret from this angle.

The numbers were clear. The weight discrepancy was measurable, repeatable, prosecutable. Vikram had signed for shipments that did not match their documentation, had either failed to notice or actively concealed the substitution, had participated in fraud against the emperor's granaries for at least three months and possibly much longer.

I should have felt vindication. Instead, I felt the particular emptiness that always followed a successful negotiation—the hollow recognition that winning required someone else to lose, and that the loser's face would remain in memory long after the profit had been spent.

"Vikram of Warehouse Seven." I spoke the formal words without inflection, the pronouncement of an official who had found what he sought. "You will surrender your seal of office and accompany us to the administrative complex for questioning. Your facility is hereby placed under imperial investigation pending a complete audit of all records and stores."

The warehouse keeper's shoulders dropped—not in surprise, but in the release of tension held too long. He had known this moment would come. He had been waiting for it, perhaps, the way a man with a terminal illness waits for the physician's final verdict.

"I understand, Rājuka." He reached for the seal at his belt, the gesture slow and deliberate. "May I ask one question before we proceed?"

I nodded, though I already knew what he would ask. The question was always the same, in my experience—the desperate hope that cooperation might purchase leniency, that confession might soften the consequences of discovery.

"Will my family be protected?"

The question caught me unprepared. I had expected him to ask about his own fate, his own punishment. Instead, he was calculating the cost to others—a merchant's instinct, perhaps, assessing the full scope of a failed venture.

"That will depend on the extent of your involvement," I said, "and the value of the information you provide."

It was not a promise. It was not even particularly encouraging. But Vikram nodded as if I had offered him something precious, and he surrendered his seal with hands that had resumed their trembling.

I watched him walk toward the warehouse entrance, flanked by the guards Devaka had summoned while I examined the grain. The morning light caught him as he passed through the doorway, illuminating a figure that seemed smaller than it had when he greeted us—diminished by the weight of what he had done and what he was about to confess.

The sack of adulterated grain sat open before me, its contents spilling across the warehouse floor. I looked at the mixed kernels—rice and millet intermingled, quality and dross indistinguishable without careful examination—and thought about the people who would have eaten this grain believing it to be what the records claimed.

They were numbers to me. They had always been numbers. Fifteen thousand measures diverted meant fifteen thousand families receiving less than their allocation, but the families remained abstract, theoretical, entries in a ledger rather than faces and voices and hunger.

The mathematics were elegant. The mathematics were always elegant. I gathered the spilled grain into my palm and let it fall again, watching the kernels catch the light as they tumbled back toward the earth.

Somewhere in the compound, laborers continued their work, unaware that their warehouse keeper had just been arrested. Somewhere in the administrative complex, clerks filed documents that would soon reveal themselves as lies. Somewhere in the city, the conspirators who had designed this scheme were learning that their first line of defense had fallen.

The investigation had begun in earnest. The numbers would lead me where they always did—toward the truth, and toward whatever consequences truth demanded.

I brushed the grain dust from my fingers and followed my prisoner into the light.
