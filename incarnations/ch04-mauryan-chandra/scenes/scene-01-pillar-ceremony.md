The pillar stood forty-seven feet—one thousand measures of sandstone, three months' skilled labor, eight hundred karshapanas for material, five hundred for carving. I had totaled these costs before the Brahmin finished his first sentence of the emperor's edict.

Sandalwood smoke drifted across the square in thick ribbons, sweet and cloying, mixing with the sharper smell of elephant dung from the ceremonial beasts stationed at the corners of the gathering. Five hundred bodies pressed against each other in the morning heat, their cotton dhotis already darkening with sweat beneath the arms and across the backs. I counted them by section—a merchant's habit I had never lost, though I had surrendered the title three years before when I accepted the emperor's service. Two hundred in the eastern quarter, nearest the river. One hundred fifty in the north, where the shade of the old fig tree drew those too old or too young to stand in full sun. The remainder scattered along the western approach, many of them newly arrived from the outer districts, their rougher weave marking them as clearly as the dust still coating their feet.

The square smelled of too many people gathered in one place for too long. Beneath the incense: bodies, betel juice drying in red spatters on the paving stones, the faint rot of flower garlands already wilting in the heat. A child cried somewhere behind me, the sound thin and grating. I shifted my weight and tasted the dust coating my tongue, gritty with the particularite grit of Pataliputra's riverbank clay.

Dharma-Mahāmātra Nagasena stood on the raised platform beside Pradeshika Sumitra, his white robes catching the light in a way that drew the eye from the pillar itself. The moral inspector's face held the particular stillness of a man who has rehearsed his expression before a polished bronze mirror—serene, but calculated to appear serene rather than simply being so. His hands rested at his sides in the prescribed manner, neither clasped nor gesturing, the posture of one who has studied how virtue ought to look.

I stood with the other Rājukas at the edge of the platform, close enough to hear but not so close as to share in whatever dignity the moment conferred. The wood creaked beneath my feet, the sound swallowed by the crowd's murmur. Heat rose through the soles of my sandals, the planks already baking in the morning sun. My forearm throbbed where I had scraped it climbing down from the records building three days prior—a minor injury I had ignored and which had begun to remind me of its presence with each pulse of blood.

The Brahmin's voice carried across the square, trained to project without apparent effort. He was reciting the emperor's words in a meter that made them sound ancient even though the edict had been carved only seven months before. I knew this because I had approved the payment to the stonemasons. Fourteen karshapanas each, with an additional two for the foreman. Seventy-two karshapanas total in labor, which did not match the figure I had calculated earlier—I had overestimated the carving cost by thirty percent. The realization itched at me like sand beneath a collar, demanding resolution.

"Thus speaks the Beloved of the Gods, of Gracious Mien," the Brahmin intoned. "All people are my children. As I desire for my own children that they should enjoy every kind of prosperity and happiness both in this world and the next, so also do I desire for all people."

I watched the crowd's faces as the words settled over them. Some showed the slack attention of people who have heard similar sentiments before and found them unconvincing. Others—the newer arrivals from the outer districts—stared at the pillar with an intensity that suggested they had not yet learned to distrust public pronouncements. A woman near the fig tree shifted a sleeping infant from one hip to the other, her attention clearly on the child's comfort rather than the emperor's proclamations.

The carved lion at the pillar's crown gleamed where the masons had applied oil to the stone, a practice that would weather poorly through the monsoon rains. I estimated the maintenance cost at four karshapanas yearly, assuming competent application and quality sesame oil. No one had asked my opinion when the design was approved. The Dharma-Mahāmātra had jurisdiction over such matters, and Nagasena's concern was with the message, not the medium.

He stepped forward now, his robes settling around him with the studied grace of a man who had practiced the movement. The crowd quieted, or most of it did—there was always a residue of shuffling feet and clearing throats, the irreducible noise of people gathered together. Nagasena raised one hand, palm outward, in the gesture of peaceful greeting that the emperor had made fashionable across the realm.

"The Beloved of the Gods has instructed that his words be carved in stone," Nagasena said, his voice carrying that peculiar resonance that suggested long training, "so that they might endure when we who speak them have returned to dust. Let all who pass this pillar remember: the emperor desires the welfare of all beings."

The words were meant to inspire. They fell into my mind like coins into a counting jar, clicking into place alongside similar statements I had heard at similar ceremonies. Welfare of all beings. A pleasing formulation. I wondered what the cost per being worked out to, dividing the pillar's total expense by the population of the district. Less than a pana each, certainly. Perhaps even less than a quarter-pana. Cheap, as public works went.

The assassin emerged from the eastern quarter, where I had counted two hundred bodies.

I registered the movement before I understood it—a man pushing forward through the crowd with more purpose than the shuffling repositioning of spectators jostling for a better view. His dhoti was the same rough weave as the district farmers', but his arms showed the defined muscle of someone who did not spend his days behind a plow. The sun caught something at his waist, a flash of metal where no metal should be.

Eight karshapanas. The thought arrived unbidden, my mind pricing the blade from that single glimpse of reflected light. Eastern forge work, quality steel, curved in the katar style favored by those who needed to punch through armor or, in its smaller versions, to kill quickly at close range. Eight karshapanas at market rate, though the actual cost would vary depending on the smith and the buyer's negotiating skill.

The man's trajectory aimed him at the platform. At Nagasena, who was still speaking about the emperor's benevolence while the blade drew closer with each heartbeat.

I moved.

My body responded before my calculations could complete, which was itself a novelty—I had built my life around the principle that all action should follow deliberation, that haste led to loss and patience to profit. Yet here my feet carried me forward, shoving through the press of Rājukas and guards who had not yet recognized the threat, my eyes fixed on the curved metal now visible in the assassin's hand.

The crowd parted around me with cries of protest. A woman's elbow caught me in the ribs, a sharp point of pain I catalogued and dismissed. The assassin reached the platform's edge, his arm drawing back in a motion that needed no interpretation.

I caught Nagasena by the shoulder and pulled, my merchant's hands stronger than they looked from years of lifting grain sacks in the warehouses before I had exchanged commerce for administration. The Dharma-Mahāmātra stumbled backward with a grunt of surprise, his careful composure shattering into simple human confusion.

The blade cut air where his throat had been.

It found my forearm instead—the one already throbbing from my earlier carelessness—and the pain that followed was sharper and colder than anything I had experienced in my thirty-four years. The katar sliced through skin and into muscle with a sensation like fire and ice married together, and I watched my blood well up dark against my skin with the same detachment I might have applied to examining a damaged shipment of cloth.

The guards reached us then, too late to prevent the wound but not too late to prevent the death it had been meant to deliver. The assassin disappeared into the chaos with a speed that suggested accomplices in the crowd, people ready to close ranks around him and obscure his passage. I pressed my hand against the cut, feeling the warm pulse of blood between my fingers, and thought: sixteen stitches, if the wound is clean. Four days' reduced function. Cost in silk thread and physician's fee: three karshapanas, possibly four.

Nagasena stared at me from where he had fallen against the pillar's base, his white robes now smeared with dust and what might have been a trace of my blood. His expression held something I could not immediately categorize—not gratitude, exactly, nor the calculation I had come to expect from men in his position. Something softer, and therefore more unsettling.

"You saved my life," he said, as if stating a fact that required verification.

I looked at my arm, at the blood still welling despite my grip, at the guards now forming a protective cordon around the platform while the crowd's cries rose in pitch and confusion. The incense had been knocked from its brazier, sending a final plume of sandalwood smoke across the scene like a curtain closing on a play.

"The blade was worth eight karshapanas," I said, because it was the first observation that came to mind, and then the pain caught up with my body's earlier decisions and the world tilted sideways into darkness.

---

I woke to the smell of sesame oil and the particular stillness that indicated I was no longer in the square. The light filtered through cloth walls—a tent, then, probably the medical station maintained for public ceremonies. My arm burned with a steady heat that suggested someone had cleaned and stitched the wound while I was unconscious.

Sixteen stitches. I had been correct in my estimate.

A face swam into focus above me: Devaka, his features creased with an expression I might have called concern if I had not known him for fifteen years. We had entered the grain trade together as young men, worked the same warehouses, drunk the same rice wine at festival time. When I had accepted the emperor's appointment as Rājuka, I had brought him with me, trusting his merchant's instincts to serve the state as well as they had served the guild. His face was narrower than mine, the bones more prominent, with eyes that had always seemed to calculate even when his mouth smiled.

"You're awake." He stated the obvious, which was unlike him.

"How long?"

"Two hours. The physician says the cut was clean—missed the major vessels by a finger's width. You were fortunate."

Fortunate. I tested the word in my mind, found it wanting. Luck was what merchants invoked when their calculations failed to account for all variables. I had simply miscalculated the time required to move my arm clear of the blade's arc.

I attempted to sit up, and the tent spun briefly before settling into stability. My mouth tasted of copper and medicine, bitter and metallic. "The assassin?"

Devaka's expression flickered—a small contraction around the eyes that I had learned to read over years of negotiating grain prices together. He was weighing how much to tell me. "Escaped. The guards found witnesses who saw him head toward the river district, but the trail went cold."

"Witnesses." I let the word hang between us, freighted with skepticism. "How many?"

"Three. All new arrivals from the eastern provinces."

Which meant they could have been genuine observers or plants designed to mislead the investigation. The eastern provinces were vast, and travelers from that region were common enough in Pataliputra that their presence would not raise suspicion. I filed the information away for later analysis.

The tent flap rustled, and Pradeshika Sumitra entered with the particular heaviness of a man bearing administrative burdens. His robes were still dusty from the ceremony, but his face had composed itself into the mask of authority that his position demanded. Behind him, briefly visible through the gap in the tent fabric, I glimpsed the square still crowded with guards and curious onlookers.

"Rājuka Chandra." Sumitra stood over the pallet where I lay, his posture suggesting he would not be taking a seat. "The Dharma-Mahāmātra extends his gratitude for your intervention."

"The Dharma-Mahāmātra could extend it himself." The words emerged before I could consider their wisdom—a failing I would later attribute to blood loss and physician's medicine.

Sumitra's lips compressed into a line that was neither smile nor frown. "The Dharma-Mahāmātra has been escorted to the palace for his protection. He will no doubt speak with you when circumstances permit." The Pradeshika's gaze moved to Devaka, then back to me. "In the meantime, I am instructed to assign you the investigation into this morning's events."

I processed the statement through the fog still clouding my thoughts. "The investigation."

"Nagasena was reviewing preliminary reports on the imperial granaries before his formal audit. Someone wanted to prevent that audit from proceeding." Sumitra's voice carried the flatness of a man reciting information he would prefer not to possess. "You are a former merchant with experience in warehouse operations. You saved the inspector's life, which demonstrates both competence and loyalty. You will determine what Nagasena was about to expose, and you will ensure that the conspiracy—whatever its nature—is brought to justice."

The assignment made a certain administrative sense, which did not mean it was a gift. Someone had tried to kill a Dharma-Mahāmātra in full view of five hundred witnesses. That someone would now be seeking to cover their traces, eliminate evidence, silence potential informants. I was being handed a problem that would make powerful enemies, with a wound that would slow my movements and a timeline that would certainly prove inadequate.

I looked at Devaka, who met my gaze with the same flicker of calculation I had noted earlier. His hands hung at his sides, neither reaching to help me rise nor clasped in the gesture of formal respect.

"I will require assistance," I said. "Requisition Yukta Devaka to serve as my deputy in this matter."

The request was reasonable enough—Devaka's merchant background would prove valuable in examining grain records, and his loyalty to me was a known quantity. Or so I believed. Sumitra nodded, the gesture of a man ticking an item off a mental list.

"Granted. Report to my office tomorrow morning for your formal assignment and authority documents." The Pradeshika turned and departed as abruptly as he had arrived, leaving the tent flap swinging in his wake.

Devaka watched him go. His face had settled into an expression I could not quite read—something between resignation and anticipation, if such a combination were possible. When he turned back to me, the expression had smoothed into the familiar configuration of old friendship.

"Tomorrow, then." His voice carried a note I had not heard before. "Rest tonight. You'll need your strength."

He left before I could respond, and I lay back against the pallet, my arm throbbing with each heartbeat, my mind already beginning to sort through the problem ahead. The grain warehouses. Nagasena's preliminary audit. The assassin with his eight-karshapana blade. Somewhere in those fragments lay a pattern, and patterns were what I had built my life around understanding.

The smell of sesame oil and incense hung in the tent's still air. Outside, the sounds of the disrupted ceremony continued—voices raised in argument, the heavy tread of guards, the distant rumble of the ceremonial elephants being led back to their stables. The pillar would still be standing in the square, its carved words promising the emperor's benevolence to all beings.

I closed my eyes and began to calculate.
