The morning light fell through Pradeshika Sumitra's window in narrow bands, catching dust motes that drifted through the still air like sediment settling in water. His office occupied the second floor of the administrative complex, its walls lined with palm-leaf documents bound in cotton cord and arranged by date and district—a system I recognized from my years managing guild inventories, though the scale here dwarfed anything I had overseen as a merchant. The room smelled of lamp oil and old paper, with an undertone of the river that seeped into everything built within three hundred paces of the Ganges.

I stood before Sumitra's desk, my wounded arm bound in clean linen and held against my chest by a sling the physician had insisted upon. The stitches pulled with each breath, a constant low irritation that made concentration difficult. Devaka stood two paces behind me, his presence a familiar weight I had grown accustomed to over fifteen years of shared labor.

Sumitra did not invite us to sit. The wooden chairs arranged before his desk remained empty, their cushions flattened by years of supplicants who had waited longer than I intended to wait. The Pradeshika shuffled through documents with studied deliberation—a man establishing hierarchy through delay.

"The Dharma-Mahāmātra's preliminary audit." He extracted a bundle of palm leaves from the stack before him, their edges worn from handling. "Submitted to this office eight days before the pillar ceremony. Standard review of granary operations in the eastern districts."

I waited. Sumitra's habit of stating known facts before arriving at his point was a technique I recognized from merchant negotiations—establishing common ground before introducing the terms that would favor his position. The lamp on his desk flickered, its oil running low despite the morning hour.

"Nagasena identified irregularities in the loss reports from seven warehouses." Sumitra set the documents down with more force than necessary, the palm leaves rustling against each other. "Vermin damage claims exceeding seasonal norms. Quality degradation rates that do not match climate conditions. Transportation losses on routes where no losses should occur."

"The inspector suspects theft." I made it a statement rather than a question.

"The inspector suspects organized theft." Sumitra's emphasis carried weight. "Systematic diversion of imperial grain over a period of at least eighteen months, possibly longer. The scale implied by his preliminary calculations suggests involvement at multiple administrative levels."

The numbers arranged themselves in my mind without conscious effort—eighteen months of diversion across seven warehouses, with losses large enough to attract a Dharma-Mahāmātra's attention. I estimated the total at twelve to fifteen thousand measures of grain, possibly more depending on the sophistication of the falsified records. At current market rates, that represented a fortune large enough to fund a minor war or purchase the loyalty of a significant faction.

Someone had attempted to kill Nagasena to prevent him from exposing this.

"The formal audit was scheduled to begin in three days," Sumitra continued. "The assassin's timing was not coincidental."

I glanced at the documents on his desk, their palm-leaf surfaces covered in the neat Brahmi script of administrative record-keeping. "I will need access to the original warehouse reports. All seven locations, going back two years."

"You will have them." Sumitra pushed a smaller bundle across the desk—my authority documents, stamped with his seal and the emperor's mark. "You will also have the power to requisition personnel, examine records, and conduct interviews with any official below the rank of Mahāmātra. Use it judiciously. The conspirators, whoever they are, will have allies in the administration."

The warning was unnecessary but appreciated. I took the documents with my uninjured hand, feeling the smooth surface of the palm leaves against my fingers. The weight was slight—perhaps twenty leaves in total—but what they represented was considerable. For the duration of this investigation, I would wield the emperor's authority in matters of grain and commerce.

"One additional matter." Sumitra's voice dropped, the change in register signaling a shift from official business to something more delicate. "The Dharma-Mahāmātra has expressed particular concern about the source of the conspiracy. His preliminary work suggested the diversion was too sophisticated for common theft. The records were falsified with expertise that implies familiarity with administrative procedures."

He did not complete the thought. He did not need to. Someone inside the system—someone who understood how warehouse reports were compiled and verified, how loss claims were processed and approved—had designed this scheme. The conspiracy had been built by people who knew exactly which numbers to alter and which to leave untouched.

People like me. People like Devaka.

I felt my former guild-brother's presence behind me with new awareness, though I did not turn to look at him. The thought that had surfaced was unworthy—Devaka had left the merchant life when I had, had served the emperor faithfully for three years, had no reason I knew of to risk everything for grain theft. Yet the shape of the conspiracy suggested merchant expertise, and there were only so many former traders serving in the administration.

"I understand," I said, and the words meant more than Sumitra could know.

We descended from Sumitra's office into the administrative complex's central courtyard, where clerks hurried between buildings with armloads of documents and messengers waited in the shade of the colonnade for their assignments. The morning heat had already begun to build, pressing against my skin like a physical weight. My arm throbbed beneath its bandages, the stitches pulling with each step.

Devaka walked beside me, matching my pace with the automatic coordination of long partnership. His sandals scuffed against the paving stones in the familiar rhythm I had known since we were young men hauling grain sacks in the guild warehouses. The sound should have been comforting. Instead, I found myself listening to it with the attention I usually reserved for examining suspect accounts.

"The warehouse records will take time to assemble," Devaka said, his voice pitched low enough that the passing clerks would not overhear. "Seven locations, two years of documentation. We're looking at three, perhaps four days before we have everything in hand."

"Begin with Warehouse Seven." I had already sorted through Nagasena's preliminary notes, the numbers arranging themselves into patterns that suggested where to focus. "The inspector's methodology was sound—his staff cross-referenced transportation records against warehouse receipts, work I might have missed alone." I spread the preliminary notes so Devaka could follow my reasoning. "The loss reports show the largest variance from expected values. If the falsification is systematic, that's where it will be most visible."

Devaka nodded, but a hesitation in the motion caught my attention—a fraction of a heartbeat's delay before his head moved. I catalogued the observation without comment. Devaka had always been deliberate in his responses, weighing words before speaking. The hesitation likely meant nothing.

Yet I found myself remembering Sumitra's warning about allies in the administration, and the shape of that hesitation lodged in my mind like a splinter.

"I'll have the Warehouse Seven records delivered to your office by evening." Devaka's voice was steady, carrying no trace of whatever had caused the pause. "Shall I arrange for copies of the transportation logs as well? If the grain was diverted, it had to move somehow."

"Yes. And the personnel records for the warehouse keepers across all seven locations. I want to know their backgrounds—where they served before, who recommended them for their positions, whether any of them have connections to the merchant guilds."

The last request was a test, though I could not have said precisely what response I expected. Devaka had connections to the merchant guilds—we both did, despite having left that world behind. If the conspiracy reached into the trading houses, those connections could prove either valuable or dangerous.

Devaka's expression did not change. "I'll compile the information personally."

"Good." I stopped walking, turning to face him directly. The morning sun fell across his features, illuminating the familiar planes of his face—the narrow cheekbones, the deep-set eyes, the slight crook in his nose from a loading accident twenty years past. I had trusted this face through grain deals and guild politics, through the difficult transition from merchant to administrator. I wanted to trust it now.

"This investigation will make enemies," I said. "Whoever designed this scheme has resources and influence. They've already demonstrated willingness to kill. If you have any reservations about proceeding, tell me now."

Devaka met my gaze without flinching. "I've served beside you for fifteen years, Chandra. Through the guild, through the transition, through everything the emperor's service has demanded. My loyalty isn't conditional on the difficulty of the task."

The words were correct. The delivery was flawless. I searched his face for any sign of the hesitation I had noted earlier and found nothing—only the steady regard of a man I had trusted with my ledgers, my secrets, my life.

"Then we begin this evening," I said. "Warehouse Seven's records, in my office, as soon as you can arrange delivery."

I turned and continued across the courtyard, leaving Devaka to his tasks. The sun pressed down on my shoulders, and my arm burned beneath its bandages, and somewhere in the administrative complex around me, conspirators were already moving to protect themselves.

I did not look back. If I had, I might have seen Devaka's expression shift as he watched me go—a flicker of something that was neither loyalty nor its opposite, but rather the complicated calculus of a man weighing debts against interests.

But I did not look back. I had numbers to examine, and numbers had never betrayed me.
