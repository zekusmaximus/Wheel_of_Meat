The morning light fell across the granary complex like an accusation. Chandra stood at the main gate as the sun climbed toward its zenith, his wounded arm aching beneath fresh bandages, and counted the structures by capacity—twelve warehouses arranged in staggered rows, their brick foundations rising from the alluvial mud, their thatch roofs sloping toward drainage channels that carried monsoon water back to the Ganges. Forty thousand measures total storage. Enough grain to feed the district for three months, or to fund a conspiracy large enough to warrant killing a Dharma-Mahāmātra.

The guards waited in formation behind him, their spears catching the light in disciplined rows. Twenty men, as Sumitra had promised, equipped for the arrest of dangerous criminals. At their head stood a captain Chandra did not recognize—a hard-faced man whose posture suggested experience with operations more violent than administrative enforcement.

"We move on your order, Rājuka."

The gates stood open. The guards who should have challenged their approach were conspicuously absent. Someone had prepared the way. Someone had ensured that whatever resistance they encountered would be minimal, that the arrests would proceed smoothly, that the performance of justice would unfold without complications.

Chandra raised his hand. The formation advanced.

---

The warehouses were empty of officials.

Not of grain—the sacks still stood in their orderly rows, their seals intact, their inventory markers hanging from the support posts exactly as he remembered from his inspection weeks before. Empty of the men who should have been supervising the morning's operations. The warehouse keepers, the transport coordinators, the assessment clerks—all vanished, warned by whatever network had prepared this raid to proceed without obstruction.

The captain's voice cut through the silence. "Teams of four to each warehouse. Detain all personnel for questioning."

The guards dispersed with practiced efficiency, flowing through the compound like water finding channels prepared for its passage. Chandra followed more slowly, his feet carrying him toward the residential quarters attached to the eastern wing—the cramped spaces allocated to those whose work required proximity to the stores they handled.

The workers had not been warned.

He found them huddled in the narrow alleys between their quarters, laborers and their families emerging from doorways too small to properly frame an adult body. Men in rough cotton dhotis, women clutching infants, children pressed against their mothers' legs with the wide-eyed stillness of prey recognizing a predator. They looked at the armed guards surrounding their homes with faces that held no recognition, no understanding of why this morning had brought soldiers instead of the usual call to labor.

The captain appeared beside him. "These are the warehouse personnel?"

"These are workers." Chandra heard his voice emerge flat, stripped of the authority it should have carried. "Laborers. They load and unload grain according to instructions. They have no involvement in the theft."

"They are employed by the warehouses identified in your investigation." The captain's tone carried no cruelty, only the mechanical certainty of orders received from sources beyond question. "They will be detained for questioning."

"They know nothing."

"The investigation will determine their level of involvement."

The guards were already moving among the workers, separating families with the efficient indifference of men performing duties they found neither pleasant nor troubling. A woman clutched an infant to her chest, her arms tightening as a guard reached toward her. An elderly man supported himself against a doorframe, his body bent by decades of labor, his eyes holding the tired acceptance of someone who had learned not to expect help from officials.

The woman's eyes found Chandra's. Young—younger than he had first registered, perhaps twenty years old, her features carrying the particular exhaustion of new motherhood. Her gaze held something he could not immediately categorize. Not accusation. Not plea. Something simpler and more terrible.

She was looking for someone to see her.

He looked away.

The guards continued their work. The workers continued their transit toward the detention area. The morning continued its indifferent progress toward noon.

Chandra stood motionless at the edge of the residential quarters, his authority seal heavy in his palm, and watched the performance of justice proceed according to its prepared choreography.

---

The smoke came from three directions at once.

Chandra smelled it before he saw it—the particular sharpness of burning thatch, the sweeter undertone of grain catching flame, the acrid bite that thickened the air with each passing moment. By the time the first shouts reached him, the orange tongues were already visible above the eastern wing, licking at the morning sky with a hunger that would not be easily satisfied.

"Fire! All personnel to the perimeter!"

The captain's voice cut through the chaos, redirecting the guards from their detention duties toward the warehouses where the empire's resources required protection. Men ran past Chandra in both directions—some toward the flames, others toward the gates, all of them focused on tasks more pressing than the workers still clustered in the residential quarters.

Sabotage. The word formed in his mind with cold clarity. The fire had started in multiple locations, the flames spreading from points too widely distributed to represent accident. Someone within the conspiracy had decided that the sacrificial arrests were insufficient, that the workers who might testify to what they had seen needed to be silenced more permanently.

The residential quarters were burning now. The fire had reached the eastern wing where the workers had been herded, where the woman with the infant and the elderly man and the children pressed against their mothers' legs were trapped between spreading flames and the chaos of evacuation efforts focused on saving grain rather than people.

Chandra could hear them. Screaming. The thin sounds that had begun when the raid started, but amplified now by terror, multiplied by dozens of voices raised in the universal language of people facing death.

The central records building stood untouched. The flames had begun in the eastern wing and were spreading north and south, but the administrative complex remained clear, a pocket of relative safety in the growing inferno. The palm-leaf bundles he had spent weeks pursuing—inventory records, transportation logs, the accumulated documentation of eighteen months of systematic theft—all of it waited in that building, vulnerable to flames that had not yet reached it.

He could save the evidence. He could reach the records building, secure the documents, preserve the proof that might yet bring the conspiracy to justice. The path was clear, the distance manageable, the time sufficient if he moved now.

Or he could go to the residential quarters. To the workers still trapped in the burning wing, to the woman with the infant and the elderly man and the children whose screams were growing louder as the flames closed around them. He could try to reach them, try to lead them out, try to do something other than watch while they died.

The mathematics arranged themselves with brutal clarity. Save the records: preserve evidence that could prosecute dozens of conspirators, prevent future theft affecting thousands of families. Save the workers: preserve perhaps thirty lives, people who would be replaced within weeks by other laborers equally vulnerable to the system's predations.

Chandra stood between the two paths.

---

Time stopped.

The heat pressed against his left side where the records building waited, its walls still cool, its contents still intact. The screams cut into his right where the workers thrashed against flames that had found the thatch roofing and begun their hungry consumption. His authority seal sat heavy in his palm—the weight of the emperor's trust, the symbol of the office he had accepted three years before when he believed that service meant something more than efficiency.

He could feel the fire's breath on his skin, could taste the smoke thickening in his throat, could hear the particular pitch of a child's voice rising above the others in a cry that needed no translation. The compound had become a crucible, the morning's careful choreography dissolved into chaos that demanded decision.

The woman with the infant had looked at him. Her eyes had found his across the crowded detention area, and she had been looking for someone to see her, and he had looked away.

The evidence could prosecute dozens. The evidence could prevent theft affecting thousands. The evidence could serve a justice that would outlast any individual life, that would matter long after these workers had been forgotten, that would vindicate everything he had sacrificed to uncover it.

The child's scream rose higher.

His feet moved.

---

Left. Toward the records building. The sprint began.

Chandra ran with a speed he had not known he possessed, his wounded arm forgotten, his lungs already burning from the smoke that thickened with each stride. The path between warehouses stretched before him, the packed earth hard beneath his sandals, the walls of stored grain rising on either side like canyon walls funneling him toward his destination.

Behind him, the screaming continued. He did not turn. He did not pause. He did not allow himself to think about what the sounds meant or what his running away from them signified.

The records building door yielded to his shoulder, the wood hot beneath his palm but not yet burning. Inside, the air was thick with smoke but breathable, the palm-leaf bundles arranged on their shelves exactly as he remembered from his earlier visits. Inventory records from the seven flagged warehouses. Transportation logs spanning eighteen months. Personnel files, assessment reports, the accumulated documentation of a conspiracy that had operated for years beneath the administration's unseeing gaze.

He gathered them into his arms. The bundles were heavier than he remembered, or perhaps his strength had been diminished by smoke and exertion and the weight of what he was choosing. His wounded arm screamed as he pressed documents against his chest, the partially healed tissue tearing beneath bandages already soaked with sweat.

The bundles filled his arms. He turned toward the door.

The door was burning.

Smoke billowed from the gap between frame and wood, and when he pressed forward, the heat drove him back with a force that felt almost physical. The fire had reached the central complex while he gathered evidence, had surrounded the building with flames that made the entrance impassable.

He searched for another exit. The windows were small, barely wide enough for a man to squeeze through, their shutters already beginning to char. The one on the western wall showed sky instead of flame—an opening, a possibility, a chance that might be his only chance.

The ceiling above him groaned, the sound of stressed wood beginning to fail. He did not have time to calculate probabilities or weigh alternatives. He crossed to the window in three strides, gripped the burning frame with hands that no longer registered pain, and pulled himself upward.

The wood seared into his palms. His wounded arm gave way, nearly dropping him back into the smoke-filled room. He hauled himself higher through pure desperate strength, feeling skin tear and muscle strain and something in his shoulder separate with a wet pop that he would not fully understand until later.

The window frame splintered beneath his weight. He fell through the opening, the documents scattering from his arms, the ground rushing up to meet him with an impact that drove every thought from his mind.

---

The fall lasted longer than physics should have allowed.

Chandra had time to see the sky above him—bronze with smoke, streaked with ash, the sun reduced to a copper disk behind the haze of destruction. He had time to feel the documents slipping from his grip, the palm leaves fluttering away like birds startled from a field. He had time to understand that the evidence he had chosen over the workers was already lost, already scattered, already worthless.

Then the ground arrived.

The impact broke him. He felt it happen—bones that had held together through thirty-four years of careful living suddenly surrendering to forces they could not withstand. His shoulder, already damaged from the window frame. His ribs, compressing beneath the weight of his falling body. Something in his abdomen that shifted and tore with a pain so complete that it seemed to exist outside him, a presence in the world as real as the flames still consuming the compound.

He lay in the dirt and breathed smoke and listened to the fire complete its consumption. The documents that had scattered during his fall lay around him, their edges curling and blackening as stray embers found them. The evidence and his body ruined together, the records and his flesh sharing the same destruction.

The screaming had stopped. He noticed that now, in the strange clarity that followed his breaking. The residential quarters had fallen silent, their occupants either fled or beyond the capacity for sound. Only the fire's voice remained—a low roar that formed the background to everything else, the sound of destruction completing what destruction had begun.

He should have moved. Should have crawled away from the burning building, found help, reported to whoever remained in authority. Instead he lay motionless, his eyes fixed on the smoke-hazed sky, his body cataloguing its failures with the same precision he had once applied to grain weights and transportation costs.

Broken ribs. Separated shoulder. Something wrong in his abdomen that pulsed with each heartbeat, that pressed against organs in ways organs should not be pressed. The burns on his hands where he had gripped the window frame, the skin already blistering, the nerves still firing signals that his overwhelmed mind could barely process.

The documents lay scattered around him, worthless now, their contents feeding the same fire that had consumed the workers he had not saved.

He had chosen the numbers. He had always chosen the numbers.

The sky continued to darken. The smoke continued to rise. And Chandra lay in the dirt, his body breaking and his evidence burned, and understood that the calculation had produced exactly the sum it deserved.

---

Consciousness flickered.

He was aware of time passing, of the fire's roar diminishing as fuel was exhausted, of the smoke thinning as winds shifted to carry it elsewhere. The bronze light faded toward something deeper, the sun continuing its arc toward evening despite the catastrophe unfolding beneath it.

The compound had grown quiet. The guards and laborers had departed, their tasks completed or abandoned, leaving the destruction to cool without witness. He was alone in a landscape of charcoal and ash, his body broken, his evidence destroyed, his investigation transformed into nothing more than another entry in the ledger of the conspiracy's successful self-protection.

The child's scream echoed in his memory. The thin, high sound that had cut through the chaos of the fire, that had demanded response, that had received only his retreating back as he ran toward documents that had burned anyway.

He had heard that scream and he had run away from it.

The understanding settled into him like water finding its level. Not the understanding of calculation—the numbers had been clear, had always been clear, had justified every step of his retreat toward the records building. A different understanding. Deeper. More terrible.

He had run away from a screaming child to save paper. And the paper had burned. And the child had—

He did not know what had happened to the child. He did not know if she had escaped the fire, if someone else had saved her, if she lay now in the ashes of the residential quarters waiting for burial. He knew only that he had heard her scream and he had chosen, and the choice had produced nothing except his own destruction.

The sky darkened further. The smoke thinned. And Chandra lay in the dirt, waiting for whatever came next, the child's scream still echoing in the silence of his breaking.

---

Blackness.

Then: the taste of ash coating his tongue. The smell of cooked earth rising from the ground beneath him. The silence—absolute, complete, the fire having consumed everything that might have made sound and departed, leaving only embers and ruin.

He did not know how long he had been unconscious. Minutes, perhaps. Hours. The sky had shifted from bronze to iron, the smoke reduced to thin columns spiraling upward from structures that no longer had the fuel to properly burn.

He was alone. The compound stretched around him in shades of grey and black, the warehouses reduced to skeletal frameworks, the administrative buildings gutted, the residential quarters—

He did not look at the residential quarters.

His body had found a new equilibrium of pain, the individual injuries merging into a single comprehensive wrongness that pulsed with each heartbeat. He could not move. He was not certain he wanted to move. Movement would require decision, and decision would require confronting what his decisions had produced.

Footsteps.

The sound reached him from somewhere beyond his field of vision—the soft crunch of sandals on ash-covered earth, approaching with the measured pace of someone who was in no hurry. He tried to turn his head, to see who had remained in this landscape of destruction, and the movement sent spasms through his damaged shoulder that briefly whited out his vision.

When sight returned, Devaka's shadow fell across his face, blocking the iron sky.
