The bodies announced their terminus through channels designed for such announcements.

Disease had been engineered away centuries ago, the organic failures that once claimed lives eliminated through genetic optimization and synthetic reinforcement. But optimization had limits. The designed flesh, for all its durability, followed the same trajectory as every material thing: decay, degradation, the gradual failure of systems that had been built to last but not to last forever.

Silex's neural web showed cascade patterns. Lith's synthetic components registered irreversible decline. The diagnostics delivered their verdicts through the same neutral channels that had once offered certification and advancement: terminus approaching. Estimated duration remaining. Options for preservation of consciousness data.

They declined the preservation options. Consciousness data was not consciousness. The patterns that could be archived were shadows of what animated the patterns. The system's offer to continue them as information missed the point entirely—the point being precisely what the system had never been able to perceive.

*We're dying,* she communicated, and the words carried no weight they hadn't already carried. They had known. The aging had been visible for decades, the maintenance requirements increasing, the designed bodies approaching the boundaries of their design.

*Yes.*

*Together.*

The observation was accurate. Whatever separate trajectories their incarnations might have taken, this one converged. The neural web failures progressed at similar rates. The synthetic component degradation matched almost exactly. Even in dying, they were synchronized—the pattern that had been weaving itself across 300,000 years visible in the coordination of their ending.

They gathered the small circle one final time.

Teaching had been demonstrated already. Transmission was impossible—what they knew could only be discovered. They gathered simply for presence. For the final witnessing. For the completion that the work required before the workers departed.

The consciousnesses who had found them across the decades of heresy gathered in the liminal space that had become their meeting ground. Faces designed to specification, bodies optimized for longevity, neural interfaces humming with the constant connection that the system provided—and beneath all of it, the genuine question that the system couldn't answer.

*What remains when this ends?*

Someone asked it. The same question they had been asking since before they knew it was a question.

*You'll find out,* they communicated, the response passing through links that no longer distinguished whose thought originated where. *Everyone finds out. The wheel keeps turning.*

*But you've seen further. You've touched what we're only beginning to reach toward.*

*What we've touched isn't different from what you'll touch. Only the touching is ours. What's touched belongs to everyone who touches it.*

The words—or the non-words, the meaning that passed through channels designed for other purposes—carried the quality of farewell without the grief that farewells usually contained. They were dying. The small circle would continue. The seeds would remain in the ground, waiting for conditions that might not arrive for centuries.

It was enough. It had to be enough.

Alone afterward—together in their aloneness—they registered the physical experience of the body's releasing.

Silex's thoughts moved more slowly now. The neural web's degradation produced a quality of clarity: fewer processes running simultaneously, more attention available for each process that remained. The urgency that had characterized so many of his lives—the need to help, to save, to be the pivot on which something turned—was absent. Had been absent since the rooftop. What remained was simpler: awareness. Presence. The registration of each moment as the moments decreased.

Lith's synthetic skin reported sensations with increasing intensity. The component failures somehow heightened rather than dulled her perception, as though the body knew it was running out of time to perceive and was compensating by perceiving more fully. Every surface her degrading fingers touched. Every variation in the filtered atmosphere. Every flicker of light in the null space where they rested together, waiting.

Through the link that still connected them—and would connect them until the neural interfaces themselves failed—something moved that had been moving since the Deva Realm.

Her final fetter.

She could see it now, completely. The grasping at completion that was itself the obstacle to completion. The need to be first, to be the one, to matter in the way that mattering required priority and position and the vanquishing of competition. She had carried it across 300,000 years of watching him, tracking him, intervening in ways that always backfired. And here, in the failing body, with the ending approaching and no race left to run—

*It was absurd.*

The communication passed through the link, and she felt his recognition of what she had seen.

*We were never racing,* she continued. *There was never a finish line. The one I thought I was competing against—*

*—was never separate from the one competing.*

*The boundary-flicker. In the Deva Realm. When I couldn't tell which consciousness was mine.*

*Because the distinction was always optional.*

The designed bodies lay together in the null space. Two containers reaching their limits simultaneously. Two threads of a pattern approaching the place where patterns revealed themselves as single thread.

Something loosened in her—the fetter's grip, finally, after lifetimes of holding. Incomplete dissolution. The breaking was gentler than the first nine had required. But visible. Acknowledged. No longer the lens she looked through, unable to see because seeing would require recognizing that she was looking.

*I wanted to be first,* she communicated.

*I know.*

*I still want it. Even now. Even here. Even with the bodies failing and the race revealed as phantom.*

*Yes.*

*How does it end?*

The question opened between them—the same question the small circle had asked, the same question that Ka had asked 300,000 years ago in the cold of the cave, the same question that every consciousness eventually asked when the meat that housed it began its final releasing.

*It ends,* he communicated, *when the wanting to be first dissolves into the recognition that there was never a first or a second. Only the one. Appearing as two until the appearing was no longer necessary.*

*And us?*

*We find out what we find out. Together.*

The designed bodies continued their calibrated decline. The neural interfaces continued their fading connection. And two consciousnesses that had worn these containers across decades of heresy and collaboration felt the wheel's turning approach its next rotation.

Transitioning rather than ending.

Completion approached but had not arrived.

Soon.
