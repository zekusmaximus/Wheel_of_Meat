Lith had achieved the third tier.

The certification hung in her neural archive alongside a thousand other data points—age, genetic optimization scores, cognitive enhancement metrics, the full accounting of a consciousness successfully integrated into the system. By the standards that The Eternal Synthesis measured, she was exemplary. Her progression through the levels had been faster than average. Her responses to the protocols had been noted for their depth. Her contributions to the collective understanding had earned recognition from instructors who rarely recognized anything.

None of it mattered.

She could feel the absence beneath her achievements the way she could feel the fabricated floor beneath her feet—present, undeniable, and utterly beside the point. The third tier offered access to advanced archives, to specialized techniques, to the refined protocols that separated the accomplished from the merely competent. And all of it was hollow. All of it was form without substance, the gesture of seeking with the seeking removed.

Past lives surfaced with increasing frequency now.

Not memory—never memory—but the kind of knowing that operated below the level of recall. Faces. Moments. The texture of other bodies in other eras: a widow's veil in a burning city, the particular weight of court robes, the smell of plague and the sound of flames. And one face recurring, male, patient, with the quality of observation that she had been observing across configurations beyond counting.

*Him.*

The recognition sharpened every time she encountered it. He was here—somewhere in the vast network of The Eternal Synthesis, wearing a body she hadn't yet seen. The thread that connected them stretched across whatever distance this engineered world permitted, humming with something that the system's protocols couldn't calibrate or contain.

Her final fetter persisted.

Nine broken, one remaining—she could perceive the mathematics of it the way she could perceive her own designed heartbeat. The grasping that prevented completion, the attachment to being the one who achieved, the competition that had driven her across 300,000 years of watching and tracking and intervening. It was still present. Still operating. Still shaping her responses before she could examine them.

*I must reach it first.*

The thought surfaced automatically whenever she touched the edge of the remaining work. Before him. Before anyone. The one who completes. The one whose completion counts.

Something in the Deva Realm had shown her the absurdity of this—the boundary-flicker, the moment of merged perception, the glimpse of something larger than either of them separately. But showing was not changing. The glimpse had faded. The grasping had resumed. And here, in flesh again, the old pattern ran like a subroutine she couldn't debug.

She began to speak differently.

Not deliberately—deliberation would have triggered the system's deviation-detection protocols. The change emerged naturally from the wrongness she perceived, the hollow core she couldn't stop seeing. When the liturgy claimed transformation, her voice carried the faintest question. When the ceremonies performed transcendence, her presence suggested that performance was not the same as arrival. When the other Adepts accepted the prescribed serenity as genuine, her attention was elsewhere, reaching for something the protocols couldn't provide.

The congregation rippled when she spoke.

Nothing dramatic—The Eternal Synthesis didn't permit drama, had engineered drama out of the spiritual life centuries ago. But the ripple was real. Other consciousnesses in their designed bodies registering something in her words that didn't match the calibrated frequencies, something that suggested the system's offerings might not be everything they claimed to be.

*She shows irregular enlightenment patterns.*

The phrase appeared in her file, as it had appeared in his. She found it during one of the archive sessions—routine access, nothing flagged, simply Lith reviewing her own data as the protocols permitted—and the phrasing made her want to laugh without making the sound of laughter.

*Irregular enlightenment.*

As if the patterns could be regular. As if the breaking-through that the ancient texts described could be scheduled, certified, quality-controlled. The phrase itself demonstrated what had been lost: the understanding that genuine transformation was precisely what regularity couldn't contain.

The hierarchy offered recalibration.

Not punishment—The Eternal Synthesis didn't punish, had moved beyond the primitive mechanics of reward and consequence. Simply support. Assistance. The opportunity to align her atypical patterns with the norms that made the system function. Her instructors, genuinely concerned in their prescribed way, suggested additional protocols, refined techniques, the specialized attention that her obvious gifts deserved.

*We want you to reach your full potential,* they communicated through the neural channels. *The Synthesis provides optimal pathways for consciousnesses of your caliber.*

She refused. Politely. Completely.

The refusal registered in her file alongside the atypical patterns and the irregular enlightenment. The system noted it without judgment, filed it for future reference, continued its vast processing of consciousness after consciousness, life after life. One deviation was anomaly. Multiple deviations might become pattern. Patterns required attention.

And then she found him.

Not physically—physical finding would come later. Through the network, through the archives, through the vast documentation that The Eternal Synthesis maintained on all its participants. A file flagged with the same phrases that flagged her own: atypical development. Irregular patterns. Potential for contribution to research.

*Silex.*

The name carried the weight of flint—primal element, stone-age tool, the spark-making material that had enabled fire and cooking and the long ascent toward whatever this engineered future represented. Someone had given him that name, or the system had assigned it, and either way the naming was accurate. He was bedrock. He was what remained when everything unnecessary had been burned away.

He was here. He was also seeing the hollow.

She began to search.
