Time passed in the way enhanced lives measured it: decades like seasons, the slow accumulation of years that would have seemed like lifetimes to the unmodified.

Silex grew. The word applied, though growth here meant optimization curves and developmental milestones, neural pathway formation tracked by metrics that left nothing to chance. The Eternal Synthesis's educational protocols guided consciousness toward approved patterns—this posture for stillness, this breathing rhythm for calm, this sequence of internal gestures for the states they called transcendence.

He learned the forms. Everyone learned the forms. The ceremonies of purification, the rituals of elevation, the graduated levels of achievement that marked progress through the system. Other children—other designed consciousnesses in designed bodies—absorbed the protocols with the ease of containers accepting their intended contents. They breathed at the calibrated frequencies. They achieved the certified states. They rose through the tiers with the satisfaction of systems operating as designed.

Silex could not.

He didn't refuse—refusal would have been noticed, would have triggered intervention protocols, would have marked him for recalibration. He simply... missed. The prescribed serenity settled over his surface like a film on water, never penetrating to whatever lay beneath. He performed the postures and felt nothing. He breathed at the specified frequencies and remained unchanged. He passed through the ceremonies and emerged on the other side with the same quiet wrongness that had been present from emergence.

*Something is absent.*

The thought surfaced repeatedly across the decades of his formation. Something wrong with the offering itself rather than with him—though the system would have preferred the reverse, would have offered treatments for deviation, solutions for anomaly. The forms were empty. The rituals were husks. The ancient teachings that The Eternal Synthesis preserved in its archives, translated and annotated and cross-referenced until they collapsed under the weight of interpretation—they had lost whatever had made them worth preserving.

He reached for genuine stillness and found only the chemically-guaranteed calm that the neural protocols provided. Bliss-states on demand, serenity without uncertainty, peace as product rather than discovery. The not-knowing that transformation required—the risk, the vulnerability, the genuine encounter with what couldn't be predicted—the system had engineered it away. Removed the difficulty. Solved the problem of seeking by eliminating the need to seek.

His instructors noted his atypical development pattern.

The phrase appeared in his file—he had access to his file, everyone had access to their files, transparency was one of the system's virtues—and it carried neither judgment nor concern. Simply observation: this consciousness did not respond to protocols as designed. Further monitoring recommended. Potential for contribution to research suggested.

*They think I am broken.*

The recognition carried no resentment. How could they think otherwise? The protocols worked for everyone else. The calibrated frequencies produced the intended states in consciousness after consciousness, life after life, the vast machinery of spiritual development grinding forward with the reliability of any well-designed system. If one component failed to respond, the problem obviously lay with the component.

But beneath the prescribed calm that covered his surface, a quality persisted.

Past lives surfaced—not as memory, which would have required mechanisms for storing and retrieving what had never been recorded, but as knowing. He had been something before. Many things. The clarity that the Deva Realm had burned into whatever he was continued to operate here, perceiving through the fog of technology, registering the counterfeit nature of what the system offered as genuine.

The forms were ancient. Their emptiness was recent.

Somewhere, in eras the system's archives couldn't reach, these same gestures had carried meaning. These same postures had opened something. These same breathing rhythms had been doorways rather than destinations. He could sense the ghost of it—the real behind the imitation—without being able to articulate what had been lost or how the losing had happened.

*The texts are preserved. The understanding is gone.*

The Eternal Synthesis maintained archives of extraordinary completeness. Teachings spanning millennia, traditions from every variant of human spiritual seeking, all of it collected, catalogued, made available to anyone whose neural interface could parse the data. But the availability had killed the transmission. Anyone could access the words, which meant no one needed to live them. Anyone could study the paths, which meant no one needed to walk them. The archive had become the destination, and the destination had replaced the journey.

Silex moved through his final certification ceremony.

The congregation gathered in the great hall—designed for acoustic optimization, lit for emotional resonance, architected to produce exactly the states that spiritual architecture had once emerged from rather than engineered. The liturgy proceeded through its phases. The tiers of achievement were acknowledged. His name was added to the rolls of the accomplished.

He felt nothing.

Or: he felt the nothing that had been there all along, the hollow core that the ceremony's surface couldn't fill. But something else registered too—a flicker at the edge of perception, a frequency cutting through the hall's calibrated harmonics. Another presence, briefly, sensing the same absence he sensed.

*Someone else sees.*

The thought lasted only a moment. The congregation dispersed. The ceremony concluded. The systems recorded his achievement and updated his status and moved on to the next scheduled accomplishment.

But the flicker persisted in his awareness like an afterimage, like an outline glimpsed too quickly to identify, like a question forming without words:

*Who else is looking through the hollow?*
