Morning.

Light touched skin through a window that faced east—not warning but welcome, not the dying of day but its birth. The small house at the village's edge held the particular quiet of places recently woken, dust motes drifting in the slanting rays, the bed empty now but still holding the warmth of the body that had rested there.

Bread on a table. Left by hands that had come and gone without waking what slept, the generosity so natural it required no thought, no exchange, no ledger. The crust still held warmth from the oven. The smell filled the small space with the scent of grain transformed by heat, of nourishment freely given.

A child's voice, somewhere outside—the high clear sound of morning games beginning, of small bodies that had slept and were now insisting on motion. Another voice answered, lower, patient, the rhythm of question and response that shaped every childhood, every learning, every growth from small to less small to the size that eventually stilled.

Dust settling where feet had walked. The floor showed the paths of yesterday's motion, the marks of coming and going that the next cleaning would erase and the next day's walking would rewrite. The pattern of lives lived in small spaces, wearing grooves into the world through the simple persistence of being present.

Light touched skin. Morning, this time. Not warning but arrival.

Where once a door had closed between two who were never separate—porcelain and distance, the bathroom's barrier against what had already been spoken—no doors remained. Not because doors had vanished from the world; the small house had doors, the village had doors, the world still knew the concept of threshold and crossing. But the door that mattered, the door between self and self, between here and there, between what seemed to speak and what seemed to listen—

That door had never been substantial. It had been drawing on glass. When the light changed, it was seen to have been seen-through all along.

Where once a mantra had been whispered for comfort—*I am boundless awareness, I am boundless awareness*—the ritual returning each morning like a blanket pulled against cold, the words that made the unbearable bearable by giving it shape and rhythm—

Silence was enough. The mantra had been a tool, and tools served their purpose until the work was done. What the mantra had pointed toward was no longer elsewhere, no longer something to be affirmed into presence. It was simply what was, requiring no affirmation, no repetition, no morning ritual to call it back from wherever it might have wandered in the night.

Somewhere—but there was no somewhere, only here—rain had fallen on a rooftop.

A city had wheeled below, lights patterning the darkness in the way human settlements always patterned darkness, the order imposed on chaos that was itself a form of chaos, the reaching-toward that was its own form of falling-away.

A question had been asked. A young voice, terrified and wondering, standing at the edge of what edges there were: *How do you accept being nothing and still want to stay?*

The question had seemed unanswerable then. The terror in it had seemed the only sane response to what the question opened onto—the void where the self should be, the emptiness where meaning should reside, the nothing that remained when everything that could be stripped was stripped away.

No one stayed. Staying happened.
No one accepted. Acceptance was never needed.

The question dissolved in its own asking. Not because an answer had been found—answers were for questions that remained questions. But because the asker and the asked, the one who wanted and the wanting, the one who feared and the fearing—these were not two. Had never been two. The grammar that made the question possible was itself the error, and when the grammar was seen through, what remained was not answer but—

Just this.

The chain had held. Three hands forming a geometry that the universe itself seemed to require—the reaching, the catching, the anchoring. It had always been holding. The fear that it might break had been the only thing threatening to break it, and the fear was itself the chain, and the chain was itself the fear, and round and round it went until the going stopped and only the round remained.

The wheel turned, visible now, the way a dreamer waking sees the dream as dream.

Still the wheel. Still the turning. Still bodies arising and passing, hungers grasping and releasing, deaths fertilizing births in the endless motion that had no beginning anyone could find and no ending anyone could predict. The village woke and would sleep and would wake again. The children grew and would age and would die and would be born again, somewhere, somewhen, the continuity that was not personal carrying forward what was not a person.

Still meat. Still flesh and wanting and the ten thousand forms of grasping that made flesh possible, that made wanting possible, that made even the grasping at not-grasping another form of meat, another turn of the wheel, another station on the journey that was not going anywhere because everywhere was already here.

Not escaped—illuminated. Not transcended—understood.

The wheel visible from outside the wheel. Not because outside existed—the wheel was all there was, was everything that could be, was the very consciousness that watched and the watching itself and the watched. But visible in the way a pattern is visible to the part of the pattern that pauses its patterning long enough to see.

And seeing was what ended suffering. Not ending the wheel—the wheel couldn't end, was not the kind of thing that ending applied to. But ending the particular quality of suffering that came from not seeing, from turning while believing the turning was happening to someone, from grasping while believing the grasping would eventually grasp something that would make the grasping stop.

The seeing didn't make the turning pleasant. Pain still hurt. Loss still grieved. The body that ate bread this morning would hunger by midday, would sicken eventually, would die in its time and return its borrowed substance to the wheel that had loaned it. Nothing changed in the facts of conditioned existence.

But the relationship to the facts—that changed. That had changed. That was the change the teaching offered, not to the world but to the way the world was held, not to the wheel but to the one who had believed themselves thrown by it.

Teaching continued.

Not as event—the gathering under the tree had dispersed, the villagers returned to their lives, the words that had arisen already beginning to transform into memory and then into understanding and then into the particular shape of each listener's receiving.

But as ongoing. As the way the morning light fell through windows and woke what had slept. As the way bread was left on tables and hands received it without asking who had given. As the way a child's voice called out and another voice answered and the call-and-response wove the fabric of a village that was itself a teaching, itself a demonstration of what was possible when the machinery of want stopped driving.

Someone in the village was explaining something to someone else—the particular quality of attention that the gathering had brought, the words that had risen and what they might mean. The explaining was teaching, the listening was teaching, the mis-hearing and correcting and trying-again was teaching. None of it was owned. All of it was flowing.

A child asked a question. The question was about something unrelated—about why birds flew and fish swam, about where the bread came from before the oven, about any of the ten thousand questions that children asked because children had not yet learned that questions were supposed to have boundaries. And the parent paused, considering, and in the considering was the teaching, and in the answer was the teaching, and in the child's next question was the teaching.

The seeds planted would become trees. The trees would shelter others who would plant their own seeds. The wheel turned, carrying the teaching the way it carried everything—not specially, not with privilege, but as part of its endless cargo, another pattern woven into the pattern that contained all patterns.

---

Morning continued. It had never stopped continuing.

Bread on a table. A child's voice. Dust settling where feet had walked.

The ordinary sounds of a village that had heard something it couldn't name, that was already forgetting and already remembering, that was exactly as it had been before and completely different in ways it couldn't see.

And in a village without name, in a morning without special significance, what had appeared as two for longer than counting could count no longer appeared as anything at all.

Not one—one still implied counting.
Not nothing—nothing still implied something missing.

Just this. The bird calling. Another answering. The light shifting as the sun climbed. The bread cooling on the table. The child's voice rising, falling, rising again in the eternal pattern of play.

Teaching continued.

The wheel turned, visible now, illuminated rather than escaped. And what had been waiting to arise had arisen, and what had been waiting to be said had been said, and what would continue continuing would continue.

Morning light painted colors across the village—gold and rose and the deep blue of sky above it all, the palette of a world that had healed enough to receive what needed to be received, that had waited long enough to hear what needed to be heard.

The trees rustled. A door opened somewhere and closed somewhere else. Someone laughed, the sound carrying without source, arriving without destination.

Just this.

The teaching continued.
