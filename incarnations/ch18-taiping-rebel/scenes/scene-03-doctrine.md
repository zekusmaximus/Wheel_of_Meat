# Scene 3: The Doctrine

The preacher's voice echoed through the repurposed Confucian hall, fierce and certain, proclaiming truths that Wei could no longer see.

"The Heavenly Father shields the righteous!" The man paced across the platform where Confucius had once been honored, his red tunic bright against the faded yellow banners that proclaimed the glory of God's kingdom. "The demons' bullets cannot touch the faithful! Their cannon cannot breach our walls while we stand in His grace!"

Wei sat among the officers, hands folded in his lap, and counted the dying men in the congregation.

Three rows ahead: the soldier with gangrene creeping up his arm, the flesh already blackening despite the poultices. He had perhaps a week. Two rows to the left: the man coughing blood into a rag, the wet rattle of tuberculosis unmistakable. A month, maybe less. Behind Wei, close enough to hear his labored breathing: a soldier whose belly wound had seemed to heal, then reopened, the infection now spreading through tissue no medicine could reach.

All of them sat upright, listening, singing when the hymns came, their faces lifted toward the promise of divine protection while their bodies rotted from within.

Wei felt the gap between doctrine and reality like a physical thing, a chasm opening in his chest. He did not doubt God—the Heavenly Father was real, Christ was real, the Kingdom was real. But the promise of invulnerability rang hollow when he spent his days elbow-deep in wounds that should not have happened to the faithful.

"The demons fear us!" the preacher continued. "They cower before the might of the Lord! We are invincible in His love!"

The congregation murmured agreement. Wei said nothing.

The hymn began without warning, hundreds of voices rising in ragged unity. Wei stood with the others and sang, his voice low, the words familiar but emptied of meaning:

*The Lord protects His children,*
*No blade can pierce His shield,*
*The demons flee before us,*
*Their armies broken, they yield—*

Wei's eyes drifted to the empty altar where Confucius's tablet had once stood. The Taiping had smashed it years ago, along with every Buddhist statue and Daoist shrine they could find. Idolatry, they said. Demon worship. Only the Heavenly Father deserved reverence.

The irony was not lost on Wei: they had destroyed one set of certainties to build another, and both seemed equally unable to stop men from bleeding.

The service ended. The congregation dispersed. Wei remained seated as the hall emptied, watching the sick men shuffle toward the doors, some leaning on comrades, others walking with the careful slowness of those trying not to jar infected wounds. None of them would survive the winter. Wei knew this with the certainty of experience. The Heavenly Father's shield had not stopped the bullets that wounded them, and it would not stop the infections that would kill them.

"Lüshuai Wei."

Wei turned. Shishuai Fang stood in the aisle, his colonel's insignia—a yellow cloth badge sewn to his tunic—faded to the color of old mustard. Fang was forty, lean as jerky, his face weathered by twelve years of war. A competent officer. A believer, but not a fanatic. The kind of man who could give terrible orders without cruelty, simply because the hierarchy demanded it.

"Shishuai," Wei said, standing.

"Walk with me."

They left the hall and walked through the West Ward's narrow streets. The autumn air was cool, carrying the smell of cook fires and sewage and the ever-present dust. Civilians moved past them with the dull efficiency of people who had learned to conserve energy—no wasted motion, no unnecessary speech. The siege was tightening. Food rations had been cut twice in the past month.

Fang did not speak until they reached the defensive earthworks at the base of the West Wall. He stopped, looked up at the ramparts where soldiers stood watch, then turned to Wei.

"I need twenty men," Fang said. "For a raid tonight. Qing supply depot, two li north. Intelligence says it's lightly guarded."

Wei's stomach tightened. "I have twenty-three men currently recovering. Most are not ready for—"

"I need twenty." Fang's voice was flat, neutral. Not a request.

"Shishuai, their wounds are not fully healed. Some still have infections. If they march, if they fight—"

"The Heavenly King requires this raid." Fang met Wei's eyes. "The depot has food. Medicine. We need it."

Wei understood what was not being said: the decision had already been made above Fang's head, passed down through the chain of command from some King or commissioner who had never touched a wound or watched gangrene spread. Fang was merely the instrument of transmission.

"They will die," Wei said quietly.

"Then they die in service to God." Fang's expression did not change. "Release them. By sunset."

Wei could have refused. Could have argued that his medical judgment should override tactical necessity, that sending wounded men to fight was murder dressed as duty. But he had learned, over twelve years, that the system did not care about individual wisdom. Refusing would accomplish nothing except his removal from command. Someone else would release the men. The raid would proceed. And Wei would lose the small authority that allowed him to save anyone at all.

He was a cog in a machine. The machine did not stop for moral objections.

"Yes, Shishuai," Wei said.

That evening, Wei selected twenty men whose wounds had closed enough to walk. He did not choose the strongest—those he kept back, knowing they might survive the next crisis. He chose the marginal cases: infections that might spread or might resolve, fractures that might hold or might shatter under stress. The ones whose survival was uncertain anyway.

He told himself this was pragmatism. He did not examine it too closely.

The men assembled in the courtyard at dusk. Wei checked their bandages, tightened the ones that had loosened, told them to keep their wounds dry and clean. Instructions that would be impossible to follow in combat. They nodded anyway, their faces set with the grim determination of men who understood they were being spent.

One of them—a young soldier named Ping, no relation to Wei's assistant—gripped Wei's arm as he passed. "Lüshuai, will the Heavenly Father protect us?"

Wei looked at him. Nineteen years old. Spear wound through the shoulder, barely healed. He would not survive close combat.

"Obey your officers," Wei said. "Stay in formation. Keep your wound covered."

It was not an answer. Ping accepted it anyway.

The raid departed at midnight. Wei did not watch them go. He returned to the temple and tried to sleep.

---

They returned at dawn. Two of them.

Wei heard the commotion in the courtyard and rose from his mat, already reaching for his medical bag. By the time he reached the temple entrance, Old Huang had the survivors on the floor, their wounds reopened and bleeding fresh.

"Ambush," one of them gasped. Blood bubbled at the corner of his mouth—lung wound, possibly. "They knew we were coming. They were waiting."

Wei knelt and began working. The man's shoulder wound had torn open completely, the careful stitching ripped apart. Wei packed it with cloth, applied pressure, knew it was futile. Too much blood loss. Too much damage. The man would be dead by midday.

The second survivor was conscious but silent, his face gray with shock. His leg wound had opened and infection was already visible—the flesh hot and red, the smell wrong. Wei cleaned it, knowing he was only prolonging the inevitable.

"Eighteen?" Wei asked.

The conscious man nodded. "Dead. All of them. It was..." He stopped, swallowed. "Like they knew exactly where we'd be."

Wei said nothing. Intelligence failures happened. Spies happened. Betrayal happened. This was war, and war was chaos. There was no pattern to see, only the endless grinding of men into meat.

The first man died an hour later. The second lasted until evening, then succumbed to the infection that had already been spreading before the raid.

Wei burned their bodies that night and updated his count.

*One hundred and three saved. Ninety-seven lost.*

The gap was six. Only six. The ledger was approaching equilibrium, and Wei felt the weight of it like stones piled on his chest. He had saved one hundred and three men in twelve years of war. He had lost ninety-seven. The ratio had held for so long—always more saved than lost, always tipping toward life. Now it teetered on the edge of inversion.

He sat in the temple as the pyre burned outside, the smoke rising into the autumn night. The empty Buddha alcove stared at him from the wall. Wei knelt before it out of habit, folded his hands, tried to pray.

No words came.

He thought of the twenty men he had released to die. Thought of Fang's flat voice: *The Heavenly King requires it.* Thought of the preacher's proclamation: *The demons' bullets cannot touch the faithful.*

The doctrine said one thing. The bodies said another.

Wei remained kneeling, not in prayer but in exhaustion, while outside the pyre collapsed into ash and embers. The count was one hundred three saved, ninety-seven lost, and the gap was closing with a speed that felt like drowning.

Behind him, the temple was silent except for the breathing of the new wounded who had already arrived. Tomorrow there would be more. There were always more.

Wei did not know that the intelligence leak had been no accident, that the raid's timing and route had been exposed by manipulation so subtle it looked like ordinary treachery. Did not know that eighteen deaths were being tallied in a ledger not his own, counted as successes in a war he could not see.

He only knew that he had obeyed, and men had died, and the Heavenly Father's protection had been nowhere in evidence.

He stood, finally, and returned to his work. The ledger would not close itself. The wounded would not heal themselves. And the doctrine, for all its certainty, offered nothing but words while Wei's hands were required to offer blood and bone and the pragmatic mercy of knowing when to stop trying.

The night deepened. The pyre burned low. And in the temple, Wei counted his supplies and calculated how long they would last before the next impossible choice arrived.
