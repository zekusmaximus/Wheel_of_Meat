# Scene 2: The First Fracture

Three months later, the count was seventy-one saved, fifty-eight lost, and the temple floor was a lake of blood.

Wei moved through the chaos with his hands already red to the wrists. Thirty bodies, perhaps more—he had stopped counting when the screaming made numbers meaningless. They came in waves: carried by comrades, dragged by family, crawling on their own. An artillery barrage had caught the West Ward market at midday. Qing guns firing blind over the walls, the shells landing where civilians queued for their rice ration.

The wounded filled the temple floor, spilling out into the courtyard. Wei's two assistants—Old Huang and a teenager named Ping—worked without speaking, their movements sharp and economical. There was no time for gentleness. No time for anything but the calculus.

Wei knelt beside a woman with her leg opened to the bone, assessed the arterial spray—survivable if he could stop it now—and moved to the next. A man missing his left hand at the wrist, the stump already tourniqueted with torn cloth. Delayed. A child with shrapnel embedded in her skull, unconscious, pupils blown. Expectant. He touched her forehead once, gently, and moved on.

*Immediate. Delayed. Expectant.*

The categories were clean. The reality was not.

A man grabbed Wei's ankle as he passed. "Lüshuai, my brother—"

"Let me see him."

The man's brother had a gut wound. Wei saw the gray loops of intestine spilling through torn cloth, saw the way the man's breathing had gone shallow and rapid, saw the beginning of shock in his unfocused eyes. He had seen this wound a hundred times. It always ended the same way.

"Give him water," Wei said. "Stay with him."

"But you can—"

"No." Wei pulled his ankle free, not unkindly. "I can't. Give him water. Let him rest."

He moved on before the man could argue. Behind him, he heard weeping. He did not look back.

The work consumed him. Hands probing wounds, checking pulses, making decisions that would ripple forward into life or death. A spear of wood through a thigh—pulled it out, packed the wound, survivable. A chest crushed by falling debris—nothing to be done. A scalp laid open to the skull—would heal if kept clean. The triage sorted them into piles: those who would live with help, those who would die without immediate intervention, those who would die regardless.

Wei worked on the first group. Old Huang and Ping worked on the second. The third group received water and a place to lie down and nothing else. Resources were finite. Wei had learned long ago that mercy meant choosing who received it.

By the time the sun reached its zenith, Wei's legs were numb from kneeling and his hands shook with exhaustion. He had lost count of the wounded. Fifty? Sixty? The numbers blurred together, united only by their bleeding. He sat back on his heels and let Old Huang press a cup of water into his hands.

"Drink," Huang said. "You're no use dead."

Wei drank. The water tasted of dust and copper—blood in the air, in his mouth, everywhere. Around him, the screaming had diminished to moans and ragged breathing. The worst of the crisis was past. Now came the waiting: for wounds to close or reopen, for infection to take root or be turned back, for the arithmetic to resolve itself into saved or lost.

A voice spoke behind him. Small, uncertain. "Lüshuai?"

Wei turned.

The girl stood in the temple doorway, silhouetted against the bright courtyard. She was perhaps ten years old, thin as famine, with a bloodied cloth wrapped around her left leg. Behind her, the courtyard was empty except for two bodies covered with torn cloth.

Wei knew her face. He had seen it a month ago in this same temple, when he had treated her mother for fever and sent the family to safety outside the walls. A village three li west, beyond the Qing siege lines, where civilians could farm and escape the crowding and disease of the city. He had thought it a mercy.

"Where are your parents?" Wei asked, though he already knew.

The girl looked at the covered bodies. Her face was blank, shock-smoothed. "The demons shelled the village. Mama and Baba..." She swallowed. "Everyone died. We came back."

Wei stood. His knees cracked. He walked to the girl and knelt again, this time to examine her leg. The wound was fresh—shrapnel, small fragment embedded in the calf. Not deep. Survivable. He worked quickly, fingers probing around the metal, feeling for the angle of entry.

"This will hurt," he said.

She nodded.

He pulled the shrapnel free in one smooth motion. The girl gasped but did not cry. Wei packed the wound with paste and bound it tightly. His hands moved through the familiar motions while his mind circled a single thought:

*I sent them to safety. I told them the village was far enough from the walls.*

"Keep it clean," Wei said. "Come back if it smells sweet or the skin goes hot."

The girl nodded again. She looked at the covered bodies. "Can I...?"

"Yes. Take your time."

She limped to her parents and knelt between them. Wei watched for a moment, then turned back to the wounded. There were still three men in the expectant category, still breathing, still waiting for the mercy of water or death. He could do nothing for them but be present.

The man with the gut wound died first. His brother held him until the end, whispering prayers to the Heavenly Father. Wei helped move the body outside. Then the second man—chest crushed, drowned slowly in his own blood. Then the third, who simply stopped breathing between one moment and the next.

By sunset, Wei had counted the cost. Forty-three treated. Seven dead. The rest would live or die based on factors beyond his control: infection, blood loss, the strength of their bodies and the will of God.

He stood in the courtyard and watched Old Huang light the pyre. Disease control required it—bodies could not be left to rot in summer heat. The smoke rose black and thick, carrying the smell of burning flesh that Wei had learned not to think about. The girl sat nearby, silent, watching her parents burn.

Wei's mind performed its accounting. The family: he had saved them from fever last month. He had sent them away to the village. They had died anyway. Did they count as saved? As lost? The arithmetic did not have a category for this.

He tried the numbers anyway. Seventy-one saved, fifty-eight lost. The mother and father—saved once, lost later. The girl—saved twice now, once from fever and once from shrapnel. Did that count as two? Or was a life only counted when it reached its end?

*We can't save them all, Shufen. Only try.*

His mother's voice was no comfort tonight. He had tried. He had sent them to safety. They had died anyway, and now the girl sat watching her parents burn with the same blank expression she had worn when she arrived.

Wei looked at his hands. They were clean now, scrubbed until the herb stains showed dark against pale skin, but he could still feel the blood. Slick between his fingers. Warm when it first spilled. Cooling as men died.

The count was incomplete. The ledger would not close cleanly. But the gap was narrowing—seventy-one to fifty-eight—and for the first time, Wei felt the future pressing down on him like a physical weight. The ratio could not hold. The siege was tightening. The wounded would keep coming. And somewhere in the invisible machinery of war, decisions were being made that he could neither see nor control.

He did not know that the artillery strike had been no accident, that the timing had been adjusted by a hand reaching back through time to ensure maximum casualties in that specific market at that specific hour. Did not know that the village he had sent the family to had been targeted deliberately, the Qing guns directed by intelligence that should not have existed.

He only knew that he had sent them to safety and they had died.

The smoke rose into the evening sky. The girl finally stood, limped back into the temple without a word, and curled up in a corner near the empty Buddha alcove. Wei watched her for a long moment, then turned back to his work. The tools needed cleaning. The floor needed washing. Tomorrow there would be more wounded.

*Seventy-one saved,* he thought. *Fifty-eight lost.*

The gap was closing. He did not know why. He only knew that the arithmetic, once so certain, had begun to feel like a lie he told himself to make the work bearable.

Inside the temple, in the growing dark, the girl slept or pretended to sleep. Wei let her. Outside, the pyre burned down to ash and bone. The smoke dispersed. The city settled into its nightly rhythm: guards on the walls, families in their quarters, the siege grinding forward one day at a time.

Wei knelt in the empty temple and tried to pray. The words would not come. He settled for silence instead, his hands clasped together, his mind counting and recounting numbers that refused to balance.

Behind him, the empty alcove stared back with its hollow absence. The goddess of mercy was gone, and the ledger was closing.
