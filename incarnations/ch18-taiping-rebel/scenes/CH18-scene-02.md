The artillery barrage came without warning.

Wei was in the middle of changing Liu's bandages when the first shell hit the West Wall. The explosion shook the temple floor, knocked dust from the ceiling beams. Liu's eyes went wide; Wei pressed a hand to his shoulder and said, "Lie still."

Three more explosions in rapid succession. Then the screaming started.

Old Huang was already moving toward the door. "Market district," he said. "They've found the range on the civilian quarter."

Wei finished Liu's bandages with quick, efficient movements and grabbed his medical bag. By the time he reached the market street, the wounded were already arriving—carried by family members, dragging themselves along walls, stumbling in shock. The shell had hit a food distribution line. Thirty people, maybe more.

Wei assessed the scene with clinical precision. Triage. The word came automatically, the system his hands knew better than prayer.

He pointed to a clear space near the temple wall. "Bring them there. Old Huang, start sorting. Young Ping—" He looked around. Ping had appeared from somewhere, pale-faced but steady. "Boil water. All of it."

The wounded came. Wei sorted.

A man with shrapnel in his leg—immediate, survivable with treatment. A woman with a chest wound, breathing bubbling—expectant, would die regardless. A child with cuts across her face and arms—delayed, not critical. On and on, the arithmetic brutal and necessary.

Three of the thirty were expectant. Would die no matter what Wei did. He marked them, gave them water, told them the truth: "The wound cannot heal. I can give you comfort, someone to sit with you. I cannot give you recovery."

One of them—a middle-aged man with intestines visible through his torn abdomen—gripped Wei's wrist. "Is it quick?"

"It will not be long," Wei said. Quiet, steady, honest. "You will sleep, and then you will not wake."

The man's face twisted—not with fear, but with something like gratitude. "Don't leave me alone."

Wei looked at the twenty-seven others who needed treatment. Looked at the three expectant cases who would die. The contradiction pressed on him: save those you can, stay with those you cannot. Medicine demanded one answer; mercy demanded another.

He did not force resolution.

"I will stay until you sleep," he said. "Then I must help the others. But you will not be alone when it matters."

He sat with the man for fifteen minutes, holding his hand, listening to his breathing slow. When the man finally lost consciousness, Wei rose and moved to the next patient. The contradiction remained—he had chosen both answers, imperfectly, without pretending either was wrong.

Old Huang was working on the trampled man when Wei reached him. "Broken ribs," Huang said. "I've bound them. Should heal."

Wei nodded and moved to check the next patient—then stopped. Huang was still looking at the trampled man, frowning.

"What?" Wei asked.

"His lips. They're going blue."

Wei turned back. Huang was right—the man's lips had a faint bluish tinge Wei had missed in his initial assessment. He had diagnosed broken ribs and moved on. But Huang had seen what Wei had filtered out.

"The ribs are pressing on the lung," Wei said, understanding immediately. "Lung is collapsing."

He adjusted his treatment—propping the man upright, rebinding the ribs differently to create space, watching the color slowly return to the man's lips as the lung reinflated. The correction came without defensiveness. Huang had seen what Wei had missed; the patient would live because of it.

"Good catch," Wei said.

Huang shrugged. "You taught me to watch the small things."

By evening, eighteen of the thirty wounded had been stabilized. Three were dead—the expectant cases, as predicted. Nine remained uncertain, their survival dependent on factors Wei could not control: infection, internal bleeding, the body's mysterious capacity to heal or fail.

Wei sat on the temple steps as the sun set, washing blood from his hands in a bucket of cold water. His back ached. His eyes burned. The ledger in his pocket felt heavy, waiting to be updated.

Eighteen stabilized. Three dead. Nine uncertain.

*Sixty-six saved. Twenty-six lost. Nine pending.*

The arithmetic was shifting, the ratio tightening. Wei had felt it all day—the sense that he was running a race against something he could not see, that the ledger was approaching some terrible equilibrium.

But the work continued. The work always continued.

Old Huang sat beside him, his own hands still stained with the day's labor. "You stayed with the dying ones," he said. It was not a question.

"They needed someone."

"The living needed you more."

Wei considered this. It was true in one sense—the mathematics of triage said treat the savable first. But it was also false in a way that mathematics could not capture.

"A man dying alone dies worse than a man dying witnessed," Wei said. "I cannot prove this. I cannot quantify it. But I believe it is true."

Huang was silent for a moment. Then: "My father died alone. In the Taiping advance, before I joined. We found his body three days later."

Wei said nothing. Some statements required only silence.

"You're a strange medic, Shufen," Huang said finally. "You count everything, but you also stay with the ones who don't count."

"They count," Wei said. "They just count differently."

The night deepened. In the temple behind them, the wounded slept or moaned or prayed. Tomorrow there would be more artillery, more casualties, more impossible arithmetic. The siege was tightening. Food was scarce. The Qing guns had found their range.

And the pattern Wei had not yet noticed was beginning to take shape—the patients he saved dying in subsequent weeks, the coincidences that were not coincidences, the invisible hand tilting the ledger toward loss.

But that was later.

For now, Wei dried his hands, returned to the temple, and began his evening rounds. Liu was sleeping peacefully, his fever still down. The trampled man was breathing easier, his color restored. The nine uncertain cases were stable for the moment.

Wei updated his count: *Sixty-six saved. Twenty-six lost.*

The ratio held. Barely.

He did not pray. Did not hope. Only worked, one patient at a time, holding the contradictions without forcing resolution, accepting the limits of what medicine could do while still doing everything medicine allowed.

It was not enough to save everyone. It had never been enough.

But it was what he had. And he would give it until there was nothing left to give.
