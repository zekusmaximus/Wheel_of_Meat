# Scene 6: The King is Dead

On the first day of the sixth month, the Heavenly King ascended. Or so they said.

The runners came at dawn, breathless, their faces carefully composed in expressions of reverent grief. Wei heard them in the courtyard before he saw them, their voices carrying the formal cadence of official proclamation:

*"The Heavenly King Hong Xiuquan has ascended to sit at the right hand of the Heavenly Father. He has left his earthly body to reign in paradise. Let all the faithful rejoice, for he dwells now in eternal glory."*

Wei stood at the temple entrance, his hands still wet from washing the night's bandages. He listened to the words and felt nothing.

Around him, the city reacted in fragments. Some wept—true believers who had followed Hong from Guangxi, who still thought the Kingdom was God's will manifest. Some rioted—men who had watched their families starve while Hong issued decrees about manna and divine protection. Most were silent, too tired or hungry to spare energy for grief or rage.

Wei dried his hands on a rag and went back inside.

Old Huang was already treating the morning's wounded—three men with minor injuries, a woman with an infected leg. He looked up when Wei entered, his weathered face unreadable.

"You heard?"

"I heard."

"What do you think?"

Wei knelt beside a soldier whose shoulder wound had reopened during night watch. He examined the stitching—clean, holding—and rewrapped the bandage. His hands moved through familiar motions while his mind circled a single thought.

"I think he ate manna like the rest of us," Wei said quietly. "And I think it killed him."

Huang said nothing. There was nothing to say. They both knew the whispers: Hong had gone mad in his final weeks, raving about angels and demons, refusing all food except the sweet dew he claimed sustained him. The official story—ascension to heaven—was theater. The reality was a man dying of starvation and delusion in a palace while his kingdom collapsed around him.

Wei finished with the soldier and moved to the next patient. The woman with the infected leg. He unwrapped the bandage and saw the flesh hot and red, the smell wrong. Gangrene. She had perhaps a week.

He cleaned the wound anyway. Applied what little salve remained. Told her to keep it dry and come back in three days.

She would not live three days. Wei knew this. Did it anyway.

The Heavenly King was dead. The theological keystone was gone. And the structure, Wei thought, had already been hollow for years.

By midday, the city had fractured into chaos.

The riot started at the Holy Treasury. A crowd of civilians—skeletal, moving with the jerky urgency of starvation—had stormed the gates demanding food. The treasury was empty. It had been empty for months. But hunger does not accept inventory reports. The crowd surged forward, was met by guards, and the confrontation dissolved into violence.

Wei heard the commotion from the temple—shouts, the crack of wood breaking, a scream that cut off abruptly—but he did not go to investigate. The riot was not his concern. His concern was the temple floor, where three new wounded had arrived.

A man trampled in the crush. Broken ribs, possibly internal bleeding. Wei packed the ribs with bandages and told him to breathe shallowly.

A woman stabbed in the shoulder during a fight over a sack of grain. The grain sack was empty. She had been stabbed over nothing. Wei cleaned the wound, stitched it closed, tried not to think about the futility.

A boy, perhaps twelve, with his arm opened by shrapnel from... something. Wei did not ask. He extracted the metal, packed the wound, bandaged it tight.

The work continued. The city was collapsing, and Wei knelt in the temple applying poultices and counting nothing.

Old Huang worked beside him without speaking. Young Ping had disappeared—fled, perhaps, or caught in the riot. It did not matter. The wounded kept coming.

By sunset, the riot had burned itself out. The Holy Treasury stood looted and empty, which was the same as it had been before, except now the gates were broken and two people were dead. Wei treated the survivors and watched the smoke rise from fires set in the chaos.

The Heavenly King was dead. The Kingdom was dying. And Wei felt the weight of it settle on him like stones piled on his chest.

That night, Wei sat in the empty temple and did not move.

He had sent the last wounded away—told them to rest, to come back if the wounds worsened, knowing most would not come back because most would be dead. Old Huang had left to check on his own family. The temple was silent except for the distant sound of weeping somewhere in the city, too far to identify, too constant to ignore.

Wei sat in the empty Buddha alcove where the goddess of mercy had once resided and stared at nothing.

The thought that had been growing for months—hidden, denied, circling like a vulture—finally landed:

*Everyone I help dies.*

Twelve from fifteen. The girl's parents. Chen and the second squad. Elder Zhou. The raid victims. The dysentery cases. On and on. Every person he had saved, every wound he had cleaned and bandaged and counted as victory, had died anyway. Not eventually—quickly. Within weeks or months. Targeted, as if his touch marked them for death.

The pattern was impossible. The pattern was undeniable.

Wei had tried to dismiss it. Confirmation bias. War's ordinary chaos. Bad luck compounded by siege conditions. But the arithmetic would not lie: the ratio had inverted. More lost than saved. The ledger he had kept for twelve years had closed against him.

And now Hong was dead. The Kingdom was dead. And Wei sat in an empty temple and thought: *I am the common factor.*

The conclusion was inescapable. The curse was real.

And if the curse was real, then the only mercy he could offer was to stop.

Wei stood. Walked to his medical bag. Looked at the instruments inside—needles, thread, grinding stone, the last pouches of herbs. His hands, which had touched thousands of wounds, which had saved forty-eight and lost one hundred thirty-three, hung useless at his sides.

He closed the bag. Set it aside. Went back to the alcove and sat down.

Tomorrow, wounded would come. He would tell them to see Old Huang. Or the other medics in the East Ward. Or no one. It did not matter. What mattered was that Wei would not touch them. Would not mark them for death.

He sat in the darkness and waited for the decision to feel like relief.

It felt like drowning.

The child came on the third day.

Wei had been sitting for fifty hours. He had not eaten except for half a bowl of manna that Old Huang had forced into his hands. He had not slept. Three wounded had come to the temple in that time. Wei had sent them away. Told them he could not help. Watched them leave, confused and bleeding, and felt nothing.

Old Huang had argued. Had demanded explanations. Wei had given none. Huang had finally left in disgust, muttering about shame and duty. Wei had remained in the alcove, staring at the stone floor, waiting for the curse to lift now that he had stopped feeding it.

The child entered at dawn.

Wei heard him before he saw him—small footsteps, uneven, dragging slightly. Then breathing, shallow and quick. Then silence.

Wei looked up.

The boy stood in the doorway, silhouetted against the pale morning light. Perhaps seven years old. Barefoot, filthy, his tunic torn and stained dark with blood. His left arm hung at his side, bleeding from a deep gash across the forearm. Shrapnel, probably. Or glass from a broken window. The wound was fresh—still flowing, not yet clotted.

The boy stared at Wei. Wei stared back.

Neither spoke.

The moment stretched. The boy swayed slightly, blood dripping to the stone floor in slow, rhythmic drops. Wei sat motionless in the alcove, his medical bag three paces away, his hands empty.

*If I help him,* Wei thought, *he will die.*

The pattern was certain. The curse was proven. Every person Wei touched was marked. The boy was bleeding now, but that wound was survivable. What would kill him was Wei's intervention—the invisible machinery of death that followed Wei's patients like a shadow.

*Let him go,* Wei thought. *Let him find someone else. Anyone else.*

The boy took a step forward. His face was pale, shock-smoothed, but his eyes were fixed on Wei with an animal certainty: *You are the medic. You help.*

Wei looked at the wound. Saw the blood. Saw the depth of the cut—not arterial, but deep enough to need stitching. Saw the boy's shallow breathing, the beginning of shock.

*If I help him, he will die. The walls will break. The city will fall. He will die in the massacre or the famine or the disease. Helping him now only delays it.*

The thought was clean, logical, irrefutable.

And underneath it, quieter, something else:

*But he's bleeding now.*

Wei stood.

His legs were stiff from sitting. He walked to his medical bag, knelt, opened it. The instruments were still there, waiting. Needle and thread. Clean cloth. A small jar of honey-garlic paste.

The boy watched, silent.

Wei gestured to the floor. "Sit."

The boy sat.

Wei knelt beside him and examined the wound. Deep. Ragged edges. Would scar badly even with stitching. He cleaned it with boiled water from the bucket Old Huang had left, working quickly, his hands moving through motions so familiar they required no thought.

The boy gasped but did not cry. Wei packed the wound with paste, threaded the needle, began stitching.

*It doesn't matter if I'm cursed,* Wei thought. *He needs help.*

The realization was not dramatic. Not a revelation. Just a fact, simple and irreducible: the wound was real. The bleeding was immediate. The boy needed stitches, and Wei knew how to give them.

What happened after—whether the boy lived or died, whether the curse followed or the walls fell or the Kingdom collapsed—was not in Wei's control. Had never been in his control. The ledger had been a fiction from the beginning, a story he told himself to make the work bearable.

But the work itself was not fiction. The wound was real. The stitching was real. The boy's breathing, shallow and quick, was real.

Wei tied off the last stitch and bandaged the arm.

"Keep it clean," he said. "Come back in three days if it smells sweet or the skin goes hot."

The boy nodded. Stood. Looked at Wei with something that might have been gratitude or might have been simple exhaustion.

He left without speaking.

Wei watched him go. Watched him walk through the temple gate into the morning light, one arm cradled against his chest, his bare feet silent on the stone.

*When the walls break,* Wei thought, *he'll die anyway. But not from this wound. Not today.*

He turned back to the temple. The floor needed washing—blood had pooled where the boy had sat. His tools needed cleaning. There would be more wounded. There were always more.

Wei picked up his bag and went back to work.

Outside, the siege continued. The Qing guns fired. The walls held. And in the empty palace, the Heavenly King's body was being prepared for burial in a coffin lined with yellow silk, his ascension to heaven already fading into rumor and myth.

Wei did not pray for him. Did not count him as saved or lost. Did not add him to any ledger.

He only cleaned his tools and waited for the next wounded to arrive.

The curse, if it had ever been real, no longer mattered. The boy's wound had been real. Wei had stitched it. That was enough.

It was all there had ever been.
