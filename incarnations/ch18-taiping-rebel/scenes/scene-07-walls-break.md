# Scene 7: The Walls Break

Forty-six days later, the walls broke at dawn.

Wei woke to the sound—not the familiar percussion of artillery, but something deeper. A bass note that traveled through stone and earth, a pressure wave that made his chest cavity resonate. Then the roar. Then the screaming.

He knew immediately: this was the end.

Wei sat up in the empty temple where he had slept since Old Huang had died three weeks prior. His medical bag sat beside him, its leather strap worn smooth by twelve years of carrying. He reached for it without thinking—automatic, the way a soldier reaches for a weapon—and moved toward the door.

Outside, the sky was wrong. Where the West Wall should have been, there was dust. A massive cloud rising, backlit by the dawn, blotting out the horizon. Through the haze Wei could see the breach: a gap perhaps forty paces wide where stone and earth had simply ceased to exist.

Gunfire crackled from the gap. Screaming followed—high, constant, overlapping. The Xiang Army was flooding through.

Wei had minutes, not hours.

He turned back to the temple.

Forty wounded lay on the floor where he had placed them over the past weeks. Most could not walk. Some could not sit. Two were unconscious, fever-bright and delirious. Around them huddled perhaps two hundred civilians—families who had sought shelter in the temple when the shelling intensified, children pressed against their mothers, old men staring at nothing.

Fifteen soldiers stood guard at the perimeter. Young men, mostly. Exhausted. Armed with spears and matchlocks that might fire once before jamming.

Wei looked at them all and did the arithmetic.

Forty wounded: cannot evacuate. Will die here.

Two hundred civilians: perhaps half mobile enough to run. The rest too weak, too young, too old.

Fifteen soldiers: could fight through the chaos or escort civilians. Not both.

Escape routes: West Gate, possibly open but likely surrounded. Or the river—which meant drowning or being shot in the water.

The math was clean. Most would die. Organizing an evacuation might save twenty, maybe thirty. The rest were already dead; they just didn't know it yet.

Wei closed his eyes. Breathed. Opened them.

"Captain Zhou," he called to the oldest soldier. The man looked up—fifty, scarred, holding a spear like it was part of his arm. "We're evacuating."

Zhou stared at him. "Lüshuai, the wounded—"

"Cannot move," Wei finished. "I know. But the mobile civilians can. Take your men. Lead them to the West Gate. Fight through if you can. Run if you can't."

Zhou looked at the civilians. Looked at the wounded. Looked back at Wei.

"Come with us," Zhou said quietly.

Wei shook his head. "My place is here."

He gestured to the forty wounded on the floor. Some were watching this exchange, their eyes tracking between Wei and the soldiers. Others stared at the ceiling, already past fear into something hollow.

"They're dead anyway," Zhou said. Not cruel. Just true.

"Yes," Wei agreed. "But I'm not leaving them."

Zhou held his gaze for a long moment. Then nodded. He turned to the other soldiers, began barking orders. "Mobile civilians to the center! Children first! Anyone who can walk, move now!"

The temple erupted into motion. Mothers grabbed children. Old men helped old women to their feet. The soldiers formed a loose perimeter around the group—perhaps ninety people in total, Wei counted. More than he'd hoped. Fewer than he'd wanted.

Wei moved among them, pointing, directing. "Stay together. Don't run ahead. If the gate is blocked, try the river. Don't stop for the wounded in the street."

A young woman—girl, really, perhaps sixteen—clutched his arm. "Lüshuai, what about you?"

"I'll follow," Wei lied.

She didn't believe him. He saw it in her eyes. But she let go anyway, turned, joined the group.

Captain Zhou assembled them at the temple entrance. Looked back at Wei one last time.

Wei nodded.

Zhou led them out into the smoke and chaos.

---

Wei followed at a distance.

Not to escape. He had no intention of leaving the temple's wounded unattended at the end. But he could at least see them to the gate. Could at least witness what happened.

The streets were apocalyptic. Smoke hung thick, turning the morning light orange and sick. Bodies lay in the gutters—civilians cut down while fleeing, soldiers killed at their posts. The gunfire was constant now, echoing from the West Wall where Qing forces were pouring into the city.

Wei walked behind the group, watching. They moved quickly, staying together as he'd instructed. Captain Zhou led from the front, his spear raised, shouting orders Wei couldn't hear over the chaos.

They passed a burning building. A child crying over a body. A group of soldiers running the opposite direction, their faces blank with terror.

Wei saw a woman in the crowd ahead—her profile, the way she carried herself—and something tightened in his chest.

*Mei?*

His sister. Or someone who looked like his sister. He hadn't seen her in thirteen years—not since the Taiping segregation laws separated men and women into different districts. She would be older now. Different. But the shape of her was familiar, or he thought it was, or he wanted it to be.

"Mei!" he called.

She didn't turn. Too far ahead, or the name was wrong, or she had forgotten him.

The group reached the West Gate plaza. Wei stopped at the edge, fifty paces back, watching from the shadow of a collapsed wall.

The gate was open. Beyond it: fields, smoke, the distant river. Escape was possible. Zhou was leading them through—

And then the cavalry appeared.

Qing horsemen, perhaps thirty strong, emerging from the smoke like they had been waiting. Like they had known exactly when and where the refugees would appear.

Wei watched as the formation wheeled into position. Watched as the order was given. Watched as the lances dropped and the horses charged.

The civilians scattered. Screamed. Ran in every direction.

It made no difference.

The cavalry cut through them like scissors through silk. Methodical. Efficient. Wei saw Captain Zhou go down with a lance through his chest. Saw the young woman who had clutched his arm trampled beneath hooves. Saw the woman who might have been his sister—or wasn't, he would never know—cut down from behind, her body crumpling into the mud.

In less than a minute, it was over.

Wei stood at the edge of the plaza and watched the bodies settle. Ninety people. Now zero. The evacuation he had organized, the people he had sent to safety, all dead.

He had saved no one.

The cavalry wheeled again, searching for more targets. Wei stepped back into the shadow before they saw him. Turned. Walked back the way he had come.

The temple was two streets away. The wounded were still there, waiting. He had promised he would not leave them.

Wei walked through the smoke and the screaming and the bodies and felt nothing.

The trying had mattered. The outcome had not.

---

Inside the temple, the forty wounded waited in silence.

They had heard the evacuation. Heard the group leave. Heard the screaming from the plaza, distant but unmistakable. Now they lay on the stone floor and listened to the gunfire getting closer.

Wei entered. Closed the door behind him. It would not hold—the Qing would break through in minutes—but it gave the illusion of shelter.

He knelt beside the nearest wounded man. Checked his pulse. Still strong. Still alive for now.

"Lüshuai," a voice said. Wei looked up. The boy—seventeen, maybe younger, wounded in the leg during the riot weeks ago. His face was pale, his breathing shallow. "Will it hurt?"

Wei looked at him. Thought about Jean, about honesty. Thought about compassion. Chose both.

"No," he lied gently. "It will be quick."

The boy's face relaxed slightly. Not reassured, but comforted by the kindness.

Wei moved among the wounded, checking each one. Some were unconscious. Some watched him with wide, terrified eyes. Some prayed—quiet Taiping prayers, invoking the Heavenly Father and the Heavenly King, theology that had already collapsed but still offered the comfort of familiar words.

Wei did not pray.

He knelt beside the boy again and took his hand. The boy's fingers were cold, trembling. Wei held them steady.

Outside, the screaming was getting closer. Boots on stone. Orders shouted in the Xiang Army dialect. The Qing was clearing the streets, building by building.

Wei stayed.

Not because God commanded it. Not because the Kingdom required it. Not because he believed it would save anyone.

He stayed because the boy's hand was cold, and holding it was warm. Because the wounded were terrified, and presence mattered. Because this was what he did.

Outcome-independent. Purified.

The footsteps reached the temple door. Wei heard voices outside—soldiers confirming the building, reporting back to their commander. The door rattled. Held for a moment.

Then splintered.

The boy's hand tightened in his. Wei squeezed back.

"It's all right," Wei whispered.

The door broke open. Sunlight flooded in, dusty and red with smoke. Silhouettes filled the doorway—soldiers, armed with spears and dao swords.

Wei looked up at them. Held the boy's hand.

And waited.
