Wei stood.

Not to fight. Not to flee. Just to stand between the soldiers and the wounded for as long as he could.

His hands were empty. No weapon. No medical bag. Just his body, thin and exhausted, a barrier that would accomplish nothing.

The boy called out: "Lüshuai—"

"It's all right," Wei said.

The sergeant stepped forward. Raised his spear.

Wei raised his hands. Not surrender. Not supplication. Just: *I am not a threat.*

The gesture bought him ten seconds.

That was all.

The sergeant's face was professionally blank. He had done this before. Would do it again. In a siege city where quarter was not given, mercy was a luxury neither side could afford.

"I'm sorry," the sergeant said.

Wei believed him.

The spear punched through Wei's chest.

Fast. Clean. The sergeant had been trained well. The blade entered just below the sternum, angled upward, found the heart. Wei felt the pressure—a terrible, invasive wrongness—and then the pain.

Sharp. Bright. Consuming.

He fell backward. The spear withdrew. Wei landed on the stone floor, his head striking the ground hard enough to blur his vision.

Above him, the temple ceiling. Wooden beams, smoke-stained and ancient. Dusty sunlight filtering through the gaps where artillery had damaged the roof.

The screaming started.

The soldiers moved through the temple methodically, killing the wounded where they lay. Wei heard it but could not turn his head to see. Could only stare at the ceiling and listen.

Spears striking flesh. Wet, final sounds. Men crying out, then falling silent.

The boy's voice: "No, please—"

Cut off.

Wei tried to breathe. His lungs would not fill. The air came wet, bubbling. He tasted copper. Blood in his mouth, in his throat.

His vision narrowed. Tunnel vision, darkening at the edges.

The smell of incense. Faint, underneath the blood and smoke. Old temple smell, lingering from before the goddess was smashed and the holy icons were destroyed. His mother's temple had smelled like this. Sandalwood and ash.

The stone was cold beneath his back. His blood was warm, spreading in a pool around him.

The screaming stopped. One by one, the voices cut off. Until the temple was silent except for the soldiers' boots on stone and Wei's own breathing—wet, failing, slowing.

He could not feel his legs. Could not feel his hands.

His vision darkened further. A tunnel of light, narrowing.

And in that tunnel, a thought. Clear and certain, untouched by pain or fear:

*I saved no one.*

*The walls fell. The kingdom fell. Every hand I held went cold.*

*But the holding was not nothing.*

*The trying is never nothing.*

*I will try again.*

The light narrowed to a point.

And went out.

Wei Shufen died on the stone floor of a temple that had once been consecrated to Guanyin, the goddess of mercy.

His body lay among forty others—soldiers, civilians, the wounded he had refused to abandon. Blood pooled around him, darkening the stone. His eyes were open, staring at the ceiling. One hand was still reaching toward where the boy had been, frozen mid-gesture.

Outside, the massacre continued. The Qing forces swept through Tianjing street by street, building by building. No quarter was given. No prisoners were taken. By nightfall, the city would be a graveyard.

But that was later.

For now, Wei's body lay in the dusty sunlight. The ledger he had kept for twelve years—forty-eight saved, twenty-three lost, then more, then less, then abandoned—was closed.

The numbers no longer mattered.

They had never mattered.

What mattered was the trying. The hands held. The wounds cleaned. The presence offered in the final moments.

Outcome-independent.

Purified.

The eighth perfection, achieved through futility.

The Xiang Army sergeant paused at the temple door on his way out. Looked back at the bodies. Saw the medic's body, his hand still reaching.

He did not pray. Did not speak. Just looked.

And moved on.

The war continued. The Kingdom of Heavenly Peace fell. History recorded the Taiping Rebellion as one of the deadliest conflicts in human history—twenty million dead, cities destroyed, dynasties shaken.

Wei Shufen was not recorded. His name appeared in no histories. The ledger he kept was lost in the fires. The patients he saved—and the ones he lost—were forgotten.

But the trying was not nothing.

And somewhere, in a pattern neither Wei nor the soldiers nor the historians would ever see, the seed of that trying took root.

*I will try again.*
