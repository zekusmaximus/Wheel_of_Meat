# Scene 1: The Arithmetic

Wei Shufen knelt in the light and counted the dying.

Seven men lay on the stone floor of what had once been a temple to Guanyin. The goddess was gone—her alcove empty, the plaster smashed to make lime for the walls—but her mercy had seeped into the stones. The morning sun cut through smoke and dust, illuminating nothing sacred, only the arithmetic of triage.

Wei's hands moved without thought. Herb-stained fingers pressed a poultice of yarrow and comfrey against a shoulder wound, checking for the heat of infection beneath crusted blood. The man beneath him—Chen, a spearman from the second platoon—had taken a Qing musket ball in the night's skirmish. The ball had passed through cleanly. Lucky. Chen would live.

Wei moved to the next man. Then the next. His assessment was silent, clinical, and absolute.

*Four will live if I have the supplies. Two might live if I make the right choices. One will die no matter what I do.*

The last man had a gut wound. Wei could see the gray-green of exposed intestine through the torn tunic, could smell the septic sweetness already blooming. Three days, perhaps four. He gave the man water—forbidden, it would hasten the end—and moved on. Some mercy required disobedience.

The "might live" cases were the burden. They consumed resources that could save three certain survivors. But Wei had learned, over twelve years of war, that certainty was a poor physician. He treated them anyway. His mother had taught him that in the hills of Guangxi, before the Heavenly Kingdom, before God descended to reclaim China from the demons.

*We can't save them all, Shufen. Only try.*

Her voice in his memory was steady, practical. She had been a Hakka herbalist, a woman who walked barefoot through mountain villages with a bag of remedies and no illusions. Cholera had taken her in '54, here in Tianjing, in the third year of God's reign. She had given Wei her knowledge before she died: which roots stopped bleeding, which poultices drew infection, which wounds were mortal no matter how much you wanted them not to be.

He finished his assessment and sat back on his heels. The temple floor was cold beneath him despite the spring warmth outside. Behind him, through the empty Buddha alcove, he could see the West Wall where his men stood watch. The siege had not yet strangled the city—food was rationed but sufficient, water still flowed from the wells—but the Qing had been tightening their grip for months. The skirmishes came every few days now. Probes. Testing.

Wei stood and reached for his medical bag. Scavenged Qing leather, worn soft by use, heavy with the weight of what remained: needles, silk thread, a grinding stone, pouches of herbs that grew thinner each month. He had learned to make do. Boiled cloth for bandages when silk ran out. Ash to pack wounds when salves were gone. The body had simple needs. Clean the wound. Stop the bleeding. Let it heal or let it kill quickly.

He knelt beside the worst of the "might live" cases—a young soldier named Zhao with shrapnel buried deep in his shoulder. The metal had to come out or the wound would rot from the inside.

"This will hurt," Wei said. His voice was soft, matter-of-fact. "Do you want something to bite?"

Zhao shook his head. He was perhaps nineteen, his face still unlined beneath the grime. "Will I keep the arm, Lüshuai?"

"If the metal comes out clean."

"Then do it."

Wei had no opium. The Heavenly King had banned it, rightly, as demon poison. Alcohol was forbidden for the same reason. Wei had only his hands and the certainty that infection killed slower than blood loss but just as thoroughly.

He worked quickly. Fingers probing the wound, feeling for the foreign shape embedded in meat. Zhao's breath came in short gasps but he did not scream. Good. Screaming tensed the muscles, made the work harder. Wei found the shrapnel—a jagged piece of iron, Qing canister shot—and gripped it between thumb and forefinger.

"Now," he said, and pulled.

Zhao screamed then. The shrapnel came free with a wet sound and a gout of dark blood. Wei dropped the metal into a bowl and pressed a wad of boiled cloth against the wound, holding pressure while Zhao's screams dissolved into ragged breathing. The bleeding slowed. Stopped. Wei packed the wound with a paste of honey and crushed garlic—what he had left—and bound it tight.

"Keep it clean," Wei said. "Come back in three days. If it smells sweet, come back sooner."

Zhao nodded, too spent to speak. Wei helped him to his feet and watched him stagger toward the door, one arm cradled against his chest. He would live. Probably. If the wound stayed clean. If infection didn't take root in the microscopic fragments Wei's fingers had missed. If, if, if.

Wei moved through the rest of the wounded with the same methodical care. A spear cut along the ribs—shallow, would heal on its own. A musket graze across the forearm—cleaned and bandaged. A broken hand from a fall during the retreat—splinted with strips of bamboo. By the time he finished, the sun had climbed higher, burning off the morning haze. The man with the gut wound had died. Wei closed his eyes and added him to the count.

*Forty-seven saved. Twenty-three lost.*

The numbers lived in Wei's mind like a second heartbeat, constant and inescapable. He had started counting in 1853, when the Heavenly Kingdom first took Tianjing and the wounded had flooded in by the hundreds. Twelve years of names and faces, most forgotten, all tallied. It was compulsive, he knew. A need to track, to measure, to prove his hands could do more good than harm. His mother would have called it pride dressed as duty. But she was dead and the count continued.

Someone cleared their throat behind him. Wei turned to see Chen, the spearman with the shoulder wound, standing at the temple entrance. He had been one of Wei's patients a month ago—a sword cut across the thigh that had wanted to go septic but hadn't. Now he stood whole, ready to return to the wall.

"Lüshuai," Chen said. "Wanted to thank you. For last month."

Wei nodded. "The wound healed well?"

"Clean as new skin." Chen grinned, gap-toothed and young. "Shishuai says I'm back on the duty roster tomorrow. West Wall, night watch."

"Good. Keep the shoulder dry for another week."

Chen saluted—the Taiping fist-over-heart—and left. Wei watched him go, watched him walk through the temple gate into the sunlit street where soldiers drilled and civilians carried water from the wells and the Heavenly Kingdom continued its slow work of remaking the world in God's image. Chen's red tunic, faded to rust-brown like all of them, disappeared into the crowd.

Wei felt the small, quiet satisfaction of work completed. Chen would live. Would fight. Would serve the Heavenly Father's purpose. The arithmetic balanced in Wei's favor: forty-eight saved, twenty-three lost.

He did not know that Chen's unit would be ambushed the next night during a raid on the Qing siege works. Did not know that a cannonball would take him in the chest, killing him so quickly he would not suffer. Did not know that in the grand accounting, the ledger was already turning against him.

Wei only knew what his hands could do: clean wounds, set bones, give water to the dying. The rest was God's will.

He turned back to the temple. The floor needed washing—blood had pooled in the cracks between stones—and his tools needed cleaning before the next wounded arrived. There was always a next. The walls held, but the Qing pressed closer each week, and the siege had years left to run.

At sunset, Wei stood in the temple doorway and looked west toward the wall. Soldiers moved along the parapet, shadows against the orange sky. Smoke rose from cooking fires throughout the ward. Somewhere a child laughed, the sound strange and precious in a city at war. Wei's hands were clean now, scrubbed with harsh soap until the herb stains showed dark against pale skin. They trembled slightly—exhaustion, not fear—and he clasped them together to still them.

*Forty-eight saved,* he thought. *Twenty-three lost.*

Behind him, the empty alcove where Guanyin had once sat stared back with its hollow absence. The goddess of mercy was gone, but the work remained. Wei would kneel again tomorrow when the wounded came. He would count them, treat them, save the ones he could. The ledger would grow.

He did not know that the numbers would invert within two years. Did not know that the ratio of saved to lost would collapse, then reverse, until the arithmetic itself became unbearable. Did not know that someone watched from a place outside time, arranging coincidences with the patience of someone who had already lost everything and was now losing time itself.

Wei only knew that Chen was healed and walking and alive, and that was enough for today.

He went back inside to prepare for tomorrow's wounded.
