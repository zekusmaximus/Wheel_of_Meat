Wei heard the whispers three days later.

He was in the West Ward, checking on a family he had treated for dysentery the previous week. The mother had recovered; the two children were still weak but improving. Wei left them with instructions to boil their drinking water and walked back toward the temple through the narrow streets.

Two soldiers stood near a well, filling leather bags. Wei recognized them from the wall garrison but did not know their names. He would have passed without speaking, but one of them saw him coming and went silent mid-sentence. The other turned, saw Wei, and his expression tightened.

Wei nodded in greeting and kept walking. But he heard the resumed conversation behind him, low and urgent:

"—told you. Don't let the lüshuai treat you."

"That's superstition."

"Is it? Liu, Chen, the whole second squad—dead within a month of leaving his temple."

"Coincidence. War kills people."

"Not like this. Everyone he touches dies. My cousin, the one with the broken arm? Healed perfect, walked out smiling. Dead two weeks later. Cannonball took him in the chest."

"You're saying Wei cursed him?"

A pause. Then: "I'm saying I'd rather die of my wound than risk his temple."

Wei kept walking. His pace did not change. His expression did not shift. But inside, something cold and sharp settled in his gut.

He had heard whispers before—soldiers were superstitious, always looking for omens and curses—but this was different. This was specific. This was his name attached to a pattern he had seen himself but dismissed as impossible.

*Everyone he touches dies.*

By evening, Wei had heard variations of it three more times. A civilian woman who turned away when he offered to check her child's cough. A soldier who asked for Old Huang instead when Wei approached his bedside. Another conversation, half-heard in a food distribution line: *"The long-haired lüshuai is cursed. Best to avoid him."*

The reputation was spreading. And with it, a horrifying implication: if people believed he was cursed, they would avoid treatment. And avoiding treatment would kill them just as surely as any curse.

Wei returned to the temple and tried to focus on work. But the whispers followed him, and the list in his tunic felt like a stone.

She came to him at dusk.

Wei was washing tools in a bucket of boiled water when he saw her standing in the temple entrance. The girl from the market—the one whose family he had sent to the village, the one who had watched her parents burn. She was thinner now, skeletal, her arms like sticks and her belly distended with the wrong kind of fullness. Starvation. The siege had tightened in the past six months. Food rations had been cut again and again. The girl had been surviving on scraps.

Wei dried his hands and stood. "You're hungry."

She nodded. She did not speak. Her eyes were huge in her shrunken face.

Wei went to his personal supply—a small bag of rice he had saved from his own rations—and scooped a handful into a bowl. He added water from the bucket, stirred it into a thin gruel, and handed it to her.

She ate without looking at him. Fast, hunched over the bowl, her hands trembling. Like an animal certain the food would be taken away. When the bowl was empty, she finally met his eyes.

"You sent us away," she said. "Everyone died."

It was not an accusation. Just a fact. A statement of cause and effect.

"I know," Wei said.

"They said it was bad luck. That the demons found the village by chance. But everyone died. The whole village. Just like..." She stopped, swallowed. "Just like everyone you save dies."

Wei's chest tightened. "Who told you that?"

"Everyone. People say if you touch them, they die later. That you're cursed. That the Heavenly Father has turned His face from you."

Wei knelt so he was at her level. He checked her pulse—weak, thready—and examined her eyes and gums. Severe malnutrition. Likely parasites. She would die within a month if she did not get consistent food.

"I'm not cursed," Wei said, though he was no longer sure he believed it.

The girl said nothing. She had stopped listening. She was looking past him at the empty Buddha alcove, her expression blank.

Wei gave her another half-bowl of rice gruel. Told her to come back every evening for more. Watched her leave, a skeletal wraith disappearing into the dusk.

Then he sat alone in the temple and pulled out the list.

He stared at the fifteen names. Twelve dead. Three survived or vanished. He thought of the girl's parents, who he had not written down but who belonged on the list anyway. Thought of the whispers: *Everyone he touches dies.*

The pattern was real. He could feel it now, could see the shape of it even if he could not understand the mechanism. Something was wrong. Something beyond war's normal chaos. Something targeting his patients specifically.

Wei took the list outside and burned it.

He watched the charcoal names smudge and curl as the paper caught fire. Watched the smoke rise into the evening air, carrying the evidence away. The list was gone, but the pattern remained. The knowledge remained. And the count—the terrible, inexorable count—remained most of all.

*One hundred thirty-three saved. One hundred twenty-eight lost.*

Five. He had five left before the ledger inverted, before he had killed more than he had saved. Five lives separating him from a truth he could not accept.

Wei let the paper burn to ash. Ground the ash under his heel. Went back inside to prepare for tomorrow's wounded.

Behind him, the city settled into its nightly rhythm: guards on the walls, families in their quarters, the siege grinding forward one day at a time. Somewhere in the darkness, the girl walked alone through empty streets, carrying the half-bowl of rice like a fragile treasure. And in the temple, Wei knelt before the empty alcove and tried once more to pray.

No words came. Only numbers.

*One hundred thirty-three saved. One hundred twenty-eight lost.*

The pattern was visible now. The whispers were spreading. And Wei had no explanation except the one he refused to speak aloud:

Perhaps they were right. Perhaps he was cursed.

And if he was cursed, what did that mean for everyone still breathing who had passed through his hands?

The question had no answer. Wei rose, extinguished the lamp, and lay down on his mat in the darkness. Tomorrow would bring more wounded. The count would continue. And the gap—that terrible, narrowing gap—would close further still.

He did not sleep that night. He only counted.
