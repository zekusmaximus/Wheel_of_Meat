The line stretched for blocks.

Wei stood to the side and watched as the treasury official—a thin man in a yellow sash, his face gaunt with the same starvation he was supposed to prevent—distributed the day's rations. Rice for a few. Manna for most. The arithmetic was brutal and visible.

Twenty-five families under Wei's care. He was responsible for their food distribution as Sim a, the lowest rung of the administrative ladder. He had arrived early to collect the allotment: two small bags of rice, one large basket of manna.

The rice would feed perhaps five families adequately. The rest would get weeds.

Wei made the choice the same way he made every choice now: with clinical precision and no illusions.

The children got rice. The elderly got manna. The adults got whatever remained, divided by need and likelihood of survival. A woman nursing an infant: rice. A man already sick with dysentery: manna, because rice would not save him anyway. A family of four, all healthy: half rice, half manna, stretching both as far as they would go.

The families accepted their portions without protest. They had learned not to argue with scarcity. Wei handed out the rations with his face carefully neutral, but inside he felt the weight of every decision, every life calibrated against insufficient resources.

A child looked into her bowl of manna and started crying. Her mother shushed her quickly, too tired for gentleness. The child swallowed her tears and ate.

Wei watched and thought: *This is what the Heavenly Kingdom has become. Children eating weeds while we call it providence.*

By evening, fifty-three people in Wei's ward had developed dysentery.

---

The outbreak started fast and spread faster.

Wei had expected it—contaminated water, nutritionally void food, bodies already weakened by months of deprivation—but the scale still shocked him. By the second day, half the ward was sick. By the third, he had run out of clean cloth for bandages and was using ash to pack wounds because he had nothing else.

The temple floor became a field hospital for a different kind of casualty. Not combat wounds but the slower violence of starvation and disease. People lay in rows, too weak to move, their bowels emptying in liquid streams that stank of rot and blood. Wei and Old Huang and young Ping worked without rest, boiling water, cleaning bodies, trying to keep patients hydrated while their intestines tore themselves apart.

They had no medicine. The Holy Treasury had nothing left. Wei boiled rags and used them to cool foreheads. He made patients drink water until they vomited, then made them drink more. He held them while they convulsed and whispered reassurances he did not believe.

And they died anyway.

An old man. A young mother. A child who had been eating manna for less than a week. The causes were identical: dehydration, electrolyte collapse, organ failure. The bodies piled up faster than Wei could burn them.

On the fourth day, Elder Zhou called Wei to his mat.

Zhou was one of the original believers, a man who had joined the Taiping in the earliest days and had never wavered. Wei had treated him for a minor wound months ago—a cut that had healed cleanly, counted in the ledger as saved. Now Zhou lay dying of dysentery, his body a skeleton draped in loose skin, his breathing shallow and wet.

"Lüshuai," Zhou whispered. "Why does the Heavenly Father allow this?"

Wei knelt beside him. He had no answer that would comfort. No theological explanation that made sense of children dying from eating what their king called manna.

"I don't know," Wei said.

"Perhaps..." Zhou's voice was barely audible. "Perhaps we have sinned. Perhaps the manna is our test. To see if we trust Him even in suffering."

Wei looked at the old man's face—gaunt, faithful, dying because he had trusted a proclamation that called weeds food—and felt something break inside him.

"This is not a test," Wei said quietly. "This is not God."

Zhou's eyes widened. "Lüshuai—"

"This is a man lying to himself while his people starve. The manna is not heaven's provision. It's grass. It's killing you. And calling it divine will not change that."

Silence. Zhou stared at him, too weak to argue, too faithful to accept.

Wei stood. "I'm sorry. I should not have—"

"No." Zhou's hand gripped Wei's wrist with surprising strength. "You spoke truth. I... I needed to hear it."

He died that night. Wei added him to the count and did not pray.

By the end of the first week, Wei had stopped tracking the ledger.

The numbers had become meaningless. He did not know who counted as saved anymore—those who survived the manna only to face next week's starvation? Those he kept alive through dysentery so they could die of something else? The categories of saved and lost had collapsed into a single truth: everyone was dying. Wei was only choosing the speed.

He sat in the temple at midnight, the floor finally empty of living patients, and looked at his hands. They were shaking. Not from exhaustion, though he had not slept in four days. From the knowledge that everything he had counted, everything he had tracked and measured and used to justify his work, was a fiction.

The ledger was a lie. The manna was a lie. The Heavenly Kingdom's promise of protection and provision was a lie.

But the work remained.

Wei could have fled. Officers had been deserting for months, slipping through the siege lines to surrender to the Qing or disappearing into the countryside. The city was a tomb. Staying was choosing to die slowly alongside everyone else.

He stayed anyway.

Not because of God. Not because of doctrine. Not because he believed the Heavenly Father would reward his faithfulness or protect his patients. He stayed because the people in his ward needed someone who knew how to boil water and clean wounds and tell them honestly when death was coming.

Function without faith. Duty without hope. The work stripped of everything except the work itself.

Wei stood and walked through the temple. Tomorrow there would be more dysentery. More deaths. More bodies to burn. The manna would keep coming because there was nothing else. The Heavenly King would keep calling it providence because admitting otherwise would shatter what remained of his authority.

And Wei would keep working because stopping would not save anyone.

Outside, the city was silent except for the occasional cough or cry. The siege had progressed beyond desperation into something like resignation. People moved slowly, conserving energy. Speech was minimal. The nightly hymns had stopped weeks ago—no one had the strength to sing.

Wei returned to his mat and lay down. He did not pray. Did not count. Did not think about saved or lost or the ledger that had once given his work meaning.

He thought instead about the girl who came every evening for rice. About Old Huang, still working despite his own hunger. About the child who cried when given manna and ate it anyway because her mother told her to.

These were the truths that remained when theology collapsed. Not salvation. Not divine protection. Just the immediate, fragile fact of bodies that still breathed and might breathe tomorrow if someone helped them.

*We can't save them all, Shufen. Only try.*

His mother's voice had been right all along. Not because trying led to saving. But because trying was what you did when there was nothing else.

Wei closed his eyes. His hands still shook. In the darkness, he could hear someone vomiting in the courtyard—another patient succumbing to the manna's poison. He should get up. Should check on them. Should boil more water.

He would. In a moment. First he needed to rest. Just for a moment.

But sleep would not come. Only the knowledge that tomorrow would be the same as today, and the day after that, and the day after that, until either the siege ended or everyone inside the walls was dead.

Wei lay in the dark and accepted it.

The ledger was closed. The doctrine was ash. And what remained was only the question: If not salvation, then what?

The answer, Wei thought, was simpler than he had believed. Not salvation. Just presence. Just hands that kept working when belief had nothing left to offer.

It was not enough to change anything. But it was what he had.

And so he would give it.
