Wei Shufen counted his supplies at dawn.

Three pouches of yarrow, nearly exhausted. One jar of honey-garlic paste, the last of the batch. Clean cloth enough for perhaps fifteen bandages, assuming he cut them thin. The arithmetic was always the same: not enough. Never enough.

Old Huang arrived as the light crept through the temple windows. "South Ward station has extra willow bark," he said. "I told them we'd share the yarrow."

Wei nodded. This was how they survived—the medical network stretching across the besieged city like a web of fragile cooperation. He had learned this slowly, through losses that taught him a medic who hoarded supplies was a medic who would eventually watch patients die for want of what he refused to share. Information and resources flowed between the ward stations: patterns of infection, artillery angles, which herbs still worked and which had spoiled. No one survived the siege alone.

"The shoulder case from yesterday," Wei said. "How is he?"

Huang shook his head. "Fever rose in the night. Infection is spreading."

Wei gathered his bag and walked to the patient's mat. The man—a soldier named Liu, twenty-three years old, wounded in the last wall skirmish—lay with his eyes closed, his breathing shallow. The shoulder wound was hot to the touch, the flesh around the stitches red and swollen.

"The infection might respond to honey-garlic," Wei said. "Or it might not. I cannot say for certain."

Liu opened his eyes. "Will I lose the arm?"

Wei examined the wound again. The redness had not yet spread past the shoulder joint. The fever was high but not critical. He had seen wounds like this go either way—sometimes the body rallied, sometimes the infection won. The symptoms refused to resolve into diagnosis.

"I don't know," Wei said, and as the words left his mouth something tightened in his shoulder—a phantom ache in a place that had never been wounded, a flash of frustration rising in his chest without source or target. He breathed through it. The feeling passed, leaving only the honest uncertainty that was all he could offer. "The infection may spread or it may retreat. I will treat it as if it will retreat. That is the honest position."

Liu's face showed something like relief. "Thank you for not lying."

Wei cleaned the wound, packed it with fresh paste, changed the bandages. His hands moved through motions so familiar they required no thought. When he finished, he sat back on his heels and looked at Liu—not at the wound, but at the man.

"You have family?" Wei asked.

"A mother in Changsha. A younger brother." Liu's voice was weak but steady. "Haven't seen them in four years."

"Tell me about them."

It was not a medical question. The answer would not affect treatment. But Wei had learned that some wounds required medicine while others required witness. Liu talked for twenty minutes—about his mother's cooking, his brother's ambition to become a scholar, the house with the peach tree in the courtyard. Wei listened without calculating, without counting, simply present. When Liu's eyes finally closed in exhausted sleep, Wei rose quietly and returned to his supply inventory.

Old Huang watched him from across the temple floor. "You spend too much time on hopeless cases."

"Perhaps," Wei said. "But he is not a case. He is Liu, and his mother is waiting in Changsha."

Later that morning, the Shishuai's aide arrived with a message: Colonel Fang wished to recognize Wei's work with an extra rice ration, officer's privilege for his service to the West Ward.

Wei let the offer pass.

Not from pride. Not from performance of humility he hoped others would notice. Simply from recognition that he was not hungrier than his patients, and the rice would be better distributed through the temple kitchen where it could feed three instead of one. The aide left confused, having expected gratitude. Wei did not explain. Some decisions did not require witness or justification.

By midday, Liu's fever had broken. The infection was retreating.

Wei added him to the count: *Forty-eight saved. Twenty-three lost.*

The ratio was holding, still tipping toward life. Wei did not trust it—the siege would grind on, the supplies would dwindle, the arithmetic would eventually close against him. But for now, the ledger remained in the black, and the work continued.

That afternoon, a new patient arrived: a civilian woman with a cough that had persisted for weeks. Her symptoms were ambiguous—fever, fatigue, blood in the sputum. Could be consumption. Could be lung infection. Could be something Wei had never seen before.

"I cannot tell you what this is," Wei said, examining her. "The symptoms suggest several possibilities, none certain."

"But can you treat it?"

Wei considered. Without diagnosis, treatment was guesswork. But guesswork based on experience was still better than nothing. He had learned that a medic who demanded certainty before acting would watch patients die while gathering evidence.

"I will treat it as lung infection," he said. "If the treatment works, we will know. If it doesn't, we will try something else. Medicine is not certainty. Medicine is informed trying."

She nodded. Accepted the herbs he gave her. Left with instructions to return in three days.

Wei watched her go and felt the familiar weight of uncertainty settle on his shoulders. Most of his diagnoses were guesses—educated guesses, but guesses nonetheless. The body did not always declare its ailments clearly. Sometimes evidence refused to resolve. Sometimes "I don't know" was the only honest answer.

He had made peace with this. The trying mattered even when the knowing was incomplete.

Evening came. The pyre smoke from the cremation ground drifted over the temple walls, carrying the smell of burning flesh and incense. Wei updated his ledger, checked on Liu one more time, and prepared for the night's wounded.

The siege was in its third year. Food was running low. The Qing artillery had found their range. And somewhere outside the walls, an army of two hundred thousand waited for the city to starve.

But inside the temple, the work continued. Wei counted his supplies, coordinated with the other ward stations, and waited for the next impossible choice.

The ledger read forty-eight saved, twenty-three lost.

Tomorrow, the ratio might change. Tonight, Wei would do what he could with what he had, and call that enough.
