Wei Shufen counted his supplies at dawn.

Three pouches of yarrow, nearly exhausted. One jar of honey-garlic paste, the last of the batch. Clean cloth enough for perhaps fifteen bandages, assuming he cut them thin. The arithmetic was always the same: not enough. Never enough.

Old Huang arrived as the light crept through the temple windows. "South Ward station has extra willow bark," he said. "I told them we'd share the yarrow."

Wei nodded. This was how they survived—the medical network stretching across the besieged city like a web of fragile cooperation. He had learned this slowly, through losses that taught him a medic who hoarded supplies was a medic who would eventually watch patients die for want of what he refused to share. Information and resources flowed between the ward stations: patterns of infection, artillery angles, which herbs still worked and which had spoiled. No one survived the siege alone.

"The shoulder case from yesterday," Wei said. "How is he?"

Huang shook his head. "Fever rose in the night. Infection is spreading."

Wei gathered his bag and walked to the patient's mat. The man—a soldier named Liu, twenty-three years old, wounded in the last wall skirmish—lay with his eyes closed, his breathing shallow. The shoulder wound was hot to the touch, the flesh around the stitches red and swollen.

"The infection might respond to honey-garlic," Wei said. "Or it might not. I cannot say for certain."

Liu opened his eyes. "Will I lose the arm?"

Wei examined the wound again. The redness had not yet spread past the shoulder joint. The fever was high but not critical. He had seen wounds like this go either way—sometimes the body rallied, sometimes the infection won. The symptoms refused to resolve into diagnosis.

"I don't know," Wei said, and as the words left his mouth something tightened in his shoulder—a phantom ache in a place that had never been wounded, a flash of frustration rising in his chest without source or target. He breathed through it. The feeling passed, leaving only the honest uncertainty that was all he could offer. "The infection may spread or it may retreat. I will treat it as if it will retreat. That is the honest position."

Liu's face showed something like relief. "Thank you for not lying."

Wei cleaned the wound, packed it with fresh paste, changed the bandages. His hands moved through motions so familiar they required no thought. When he finished, he sat back on his heels and looked at Liu—not at the wound, but at the man.

"You have family?" Wei asked.

"A mother in Changsha. A younger brother." Liu's voice was weak but steady. "Haven't seen them in four years."

"Tell me about them."

It was not a medical question. The answer would not affect treatment. But Wei had learned that some wounds required medicine while others required witness. Liu talked for twenty minutes—about his mother's cooking, his brother's ambition to become a scholar, the house with the peach tree in the courtyard. Wei listened without calculating, without counting, simply present. When Liu's eyes finally closed in exhausted sleep, Wei rose quietly and returned to his supply inventory.

Old Huang watched him from across the temple floor. "You spend too much time on hopeless cases."

"Perhaps," Wei said. "But he is not a case. He is Liu, and his mother is waiting in Changsha."

Later that morning, the Shishuai's aide arrived with a message: Colonel Fang wished to recognize Wei's work with an extra rice ration, officer's privilege for his service to the West Ward.

Wei let the offer pass.

Not from pride. Not from performance of humility he hoped others would notice. Simply from recognition that he was not hungrier than his patients, and the rice would be better distributed through the temple kitchen where it could feed three instead of one. The aide left confused, having expected gratitude. Wei did not explain. Some decisions did not require witness or justification.

By midday, Liu's fever had broken. The infection was retreating.

Wei added him to the count: *Forty-eight saved. Twenty-three lost.*

The ratio was holding, still tipping toward life. Wei did not trust it—the siege would grind on, the supplies would dwindle, the arithmetic would eventually close against him. But for now, the ledger remained in the black, and the work continued.

That afternoon, a new patient arrived: a civilian woman with a cough that had persisted for weeks. Her symptoms were ambiguous—fever, fatigue, blood in the sputum. Could be consumption. Could be lung infection. Could be something Wei had never seen before.

"I cannot tell you what this is," Wei said, examining her. "The symptoms suggest several possibilities, none certain."

"But can you treat it?"

Wei considered. Without diagnosis, treatment was guesswork. But guesswork based on experience was still better than nothing. He had learned that a medic who demanded certainty before acting would watch patients die while gathering evidence.

"I will treat it as lung infection," he said. "If the treatment works, we will know. If it doesn't, we will try something else. Medicine is not certainty. Medicine is informed trying."

She nodded. Accepted the herbs he gave her. Left with instructions to return in three days.

Wei watched her go and felt the familiar weight of uncertainty settle on his shoulders. Most of his diagnoses were guesses—educated guesses, but guesses nonetheless. The body did not always declare its ailments clearly. Sometimes evidence refused to resolve. Sometimes "I don't know" was the only honest answer.

He had made peace with this. The trying mattered even when the knowing was incomplete.

Evening came. The pyre smoke from the cremation ground drifted over the temple walls, carrying the smell of burning flesh and incense. Wei updated his ledger, checked on Liu one more time, and prepared for the night's wounded.

The siege was in its third year. Food was running low. The Qing artillery had found their range. And somewhere outside the walls, an army of two hundred thousand waited for the city to starve.

But inside the temple, the work continued. Wei counted his supplies, coordinated with the other ward stations, and waited for the next impossible choice.

The ledger read forty-eight saved, twenty-three lost.

Tomorrow, the ratio might change. Tonight, Wei would do what he could with what he had, and call that enough.

---

The artillery barrage came without warning.

Wei was in the middle of changing Liu's bandages when the first shell hit the West Wall. The explosion shook the temple floor, knocked dust from the ceiling beams. Liu's eyes went wide; Wei pressed a hand to his shoulder and said, "Lie still."

Three more explosions in rapid succession. Then the screaming started.

Old Huang was already moving toward the door. "Market district," he said. "They've found the range on the civilian quarter."

Wei finished Liu's bandages with quick, efficient movements and grabbed his medical bag. By the time he reached the market street, the wounded were already arriving—carried by family members, dragging themselves along walls, stumbling in shock. The shell had hit a food distribution line. Thirty people, maybe more.

Wei assessed the scene with clinical precision. Triage. The word came automatically, the system his hands knew better than prayer.

He pointed to a clear space near the temple wall. "Bring them there. Old Huang, start sorting. Young Ping—" He looked around. Ping had appeared from somewhere, pale-faced but steady. "Boil water. All of it."

The wounded came. Wei sorted.

A man with shrapnel in his leg—immediate, survivable with treatment. A woman with a chest wound, breathing bubbling—expectant, would die regardless. A child with cuts across her face and arms—delayed, not critical. On and on, the arithmetic brutal and necessary.

Three of the thirty were expectant. Would die no matter what Wei did. He marked them, gave them water, told them the truth: "The wound cannot heal. I can give you comfort, someone to sit with you. I cannot give you recovery."

One of them—a middle-aged man with intestines visible through his torn abdomen—gripped Wei's wrist. "Is it quick?"

"It will not be long," Wei said. Quiet, steady, honest. "You will sleep, and then you will not wake."

The man's face twisted—not with fear, but with something like gratitude. "Don't leave me alone."

Wei looked at the twenty-seven others who needed treatment. Looked at the three expectant cases who would die. The contradiction pressed on him: save those you can, stay with those you cannot. Medicine demanded one answer; mercy demanded another.

He did not force resolution.

"I will stay until you sleep," he said. "Then I must help the others. But you will not be alone when it matters."

He sat with the man for fifteen minutes, holding his hand, listening to his breathing slow. When the man finally lost consciousness, Wei rose and moved to the next patient. The contradiction remained—he had chosen both answers, imperfectly, without pretending either was wrong.

Old Huang was working on the trampled man when Wei reached him. "Broken ribs," Huang said. "I've bound them. Should heal."

Wei nodded and moved to check the next patient—then stopped. Huang was still looking at the trampled man, frowning.

"What?" Wei asked.

"His lips. They're going blue."

Wei turned back. Huang was right—the man's lips had a faint bluish tinge Wei had missed in his initial assessment. He had diagnosed broken ribs and moved on. But Huang had seen what Wei had filtered out.

"The ribs are pressing on the lung," Wei said, understanding immediately. "Lung is collapsing."

He adjusted his treatment—propping the man upright, rebinding the ribs differently to create space, watching the color slowly return to the man's lips as the lung reinflated. The correction came without defensiveness. Huang had seen what Wei had missed; the patient would live because of it.

"Good catch," Wei said.

Huang shrugged. "You taught me to watch the small things."

By evening, eighteen of the thirty wounded had been stabilized. Three were dead—the expectant cases, as predicted. Nine remained uncertain, their survival dependent on factors Wei could not control: infection, internal bleeding, the body's mysterious capacity to heal or fail.

Wei sat on the temple steps as the sun set, washing blood from his hands in a bucket of cold water. His back ached. His eyes burned. The ledger in his pocket felt heavy, waiting to be updated.

Eighteen stabilized. Three dead. Nine uncertain.

*Sixty-six saved. Twenty-six lost. Nine pending.*

The arithmetic was shifting, the ratio tightening. Wei had felt it all day—the sense that he was running a race against something he could not see, that the ledger was approaching some terrible equilibrium.

But the work continued. The work always continued.

Old Huang sat beside him, his own hands still stained with the day's labor. "You stayed with the dying ones," he said. It was not a question.

"They needed someone."

"The living needed you more."

Wei considered this. It was true in one sense—the mathematics of triage said treat the savable first. But it was also false in a way that mathematics could not capture.

"A man dying alone dies worse than a man dying witnessed," Wei said. "I cannot prove this. I cannot quantify it. But I believe it is true."

Huang was silent for a moment. Then: "My father died alone. In the Taiping advance, before I joined. We found his body three days later."

Wei said nothing. Some statements required only silence.

"You're a strange medic, Shufen," Huang said finally. "You count everything, but you also stay with the ones who don't count."

"They count," Wei said. "They just count differently."

The night deepened. In the temple behind them, the wounded slept or moaned or prayed. Tomorrow there would be more artillery, more casualties, more impossible arithmetic. The siege was tightening. Food was scarce. The Qing guns had found their range.

And the pattern Wei had not yet noticed was beginning to take shape—the patients he saved dying in subsequent weeks, the coincidences that were not coincidences, the invisible hand tilting the ledger toward loss.

But that was later.

For now, Wei dried his hands, returned to the temple, and began his evening rounds. Liu was sleeping peacefully, his fever still down. The trampled man was breathing easier, his color restored. The nine uncertain cases were stable for the moment.

Wei updated his count: *Sixty-six saved. Twenty-six lost.*

The ratio held. Barely.

He did not pray. Did not hope. Only worked, one patient at a time, holding the contradictions without forcing resolution, accepting the limits of what medicine could do while still doing everything medicine allowed.

It was not enough to save everyone. It had never been enough.

But it was what he had. And he would give it until there was nothing left to give.

---

They returned at dawn. Two of them.

Wei heard the commotion in the courtyard and rose from his mat, already reaching for his medical bag. By the time he reached the temple entrance, Old Huang had the survivors on the floor, their wounds reopened and bleeding fresh.

"Ambush," one of them gasped. Blood bubbled at the corner of his mouth—lung wound, possibly. "They knew we were coming. They were waiting."

Wei knelt and began working. The man's shoulder wound had torn open completely, the careful stitching ripped apart. Wei packed it with cloth, applied pressure, knew it was futile. Too much blood loss. Too much damage. The man would be dead by midday.

The second survivor was conscious but silent, his face gray with shock. His leg wound had opened and infection was already visible—the flesh hot and red, the smell wrong. Wei cleaned it, knowing he was only prolonging the inevitable.

"Eighteen?" Wei asked.

The conscious man nodded. "Dead. All of them. It was..." He stopped, swallowed. "Like they knew exactly where we'd be."

Wei said nothing. Intelligence failures happened. Spies happened. Betrayal happened. This was war, and war was chaos. There was no pattern to see, only the endless grinding of men into meat.

The first man died an hour later. The second lasted until evening, then succumbed to the infection that had already been spreading before the raid.

Wei burned their bodies that night and updated his count.

*One hundred and three saved. Ninety-seven lost.*

The gap was six. Only six. The ledger was approaching equilibrium, and Wei felt the weight of it like stones piled on his chest. He had saved one hundred and three men in twelve years of war. He had lost ninety-seven. The ratio had held for so long—always more saved than lost, always tipping toward life. Now it teetered on the edge of inversion.

He sat in the temple as the pyre burned outside, the smoke rising into the autumn night. The empty Buddha alcove stared at him from the wall. Wei knelt before it out of habit, folded his hands, tried to pray.

No words came.

He thought of the twenty men he had released to die. Thought of Fang's flat voice: *The Heavenly King requires it.* Thought of the preacher's proclamation: *The demons' bullets cannot touch the faithful.*

The doctrine said one thing. The bodies said another.

He could have let this become hatred—for the Qing who had ambushed them, for the Heavenly King whose doctrine had failed, for the God who had promised protection and delivered slaughter. Wei felt the possibility of bitterness like heat near a fire, present and available. He let it pass through him without taking hold. The hatred would not bring back the eighteen. The rage would not close the ledger in his favor. He registered the facts cleanly: the doctrine had promised, the protection had not come, and the work continued regardless. Clean observation. Not acceptance, but endurance without poison.

Wei remained kneeling, not in prayer but in exhaustion, while outside the pyre collapsed into ash and embers. The count was one hundred three saved, ninety-seven lost, and the gap was closing with a speed that felt like drowning.

Behind him, the temple was silent except for the breathing of the new wounded who had already arrived. Tomorrow there would be more. There were always more.

Wei did not know that the intelligence leak had been no accident, that the raid's timing and route had been exposed by manipulation so subtle it looked like ordinary treachery. Did not know that eighteen deaths were being tallied in a ledger not his own, counted as successes in a war he could not see.

He only knew that he had obeyed, and men had died, and the Heavenly Father's protection had been nowhere in evidence.

He stood, finally, and returned to his work. The ledger would not close itself. The wounded would not heal themselves. And the doctrine, for all its certainty, offered nothing but words while Wei's hands were required to offer blood and bone and the pragmatic mercy of knowing when to stop trying.

The night deepened. The pyre burned low. And in the temple, Wei counted his supplies and calculated how long they would last before the next impossible choice arrived.

---

Wei heard the whispers three days later.

He was in the West Ward, checking on a family he had treated for dysentery the previous week. The mother had recovered; the two children were still weak but improving. Wei left them with instructions to boil their drinking water and walked back toward the temple through the narrow streets.

Two soldiers stood near a well, filling leather bags. Wei recognized them from the wall garrison but did not know their names. He would have passed without speaking, but one of them saw him coming and went silent mid-sentence. The other turned, saw Wei, and his expression tightened.

Wei nodded in greeting and kept walking. But he heard the resumed conversation behind him, low and urgent:

"—told you. Don't let the lüshuai treat you."

"That's superstition."

"Is it? Liu, Chen, the whole second squad—dead within a month of leaving his temple."

"Coincidence. War kills people."

"Not like this. Everyone he touches dies. My cousin, the one with the broken arm? Healed perfect, walked out smiling. Dead two weeks later. Cannonball took him in the chest."

"You're saying Wei cursed him?"

A pause. Then: "I'm saying I'd rather die of my wound than risk his temple."

Wei kept walking. His pace did not change. His expression did not shift. But inside, something cold and sharp settled in his gut.

He had heard whispers before—soldiers were superstitious, always looking for omens and curses—but this was different. This was specific. This was his name attached to a pattern he had seen himself but dismissed as impossible.

*Everyone he touches dies.*

By evening, Wei had heard variations of it three more times. A civilian woman who turned away when he offered to check her child's cough. A soldier who asked for Old Huang instead when Wei approached his bedside. Another conversation, half-heard in a food distribution line: *"The long-haired lüshuai is cursed. Best to avoid him."*

The reputation was spreading. And with it, a horrifying implication: if people believed he was cursed, they would avoid treatment. And avoiding treatment would kill them just as surely as any curse.

Wei returned to the temple and tried to focus on work. But the whispers followed him, and the list in his tunic felt like a stone.

---

She came to him at dusk.

Wei was washing tools in a bucket of boiled water when he saw her standing in the temple entrance. The girl from the market—the one whose family he had sent to the village, the one who had watched her parents burn. She was thinner now, skeletal, her arms like sticks and her belly distended with the wrong kind of fullness. Starvation. The siege had tightened in the past six months. Food rations had been cut again and again. The girl had been surviving on scraps.

Wei dried his hands and stood. "You're hungry."

She nodded. She did not speak. Her eyes were huge in her shrunken face.

Wei went to his personal supply—a small bag of rice he had saved from his own rations—and scooped a handful into a bowl. He added water from the bucket, stirred it into a thin gruel, and handed it to her.

She ate without looking at him. Fast, hunched over the bowl, her hands trembling. Like an animal certain the food would be taken away. When the bowl was empty, she finally met his eyes.

"You sent us away," she said. "Everyone died."

It was not an accusation. Just a fact. A statement of cause and effect.

"I know," Wei said.

"They said it was bad luck. That the demons found the village by chance. But everyone died. The whole village. Just like..." She stopped, swallowed. "Just like everyone you save dies."

Wei's chest tightened. "Who told you that?"

"Everyone. People say if you touch them, they die later. That you're cursed. That the Heavenly Father has turned His face from you."

Wei knelt so he was at her level. He checked her pulse—weak, thready—and examined her eyes and gums. Severe malnutrition. Likely parasites. She would die within a month if she did not get consistent food.

"I'm not cursed," Wei said, though he was no longer sure he believed it.

The girl said nothing. She had stopped listening. She was looking past him at the empty Buddha alcove, her expression blank.

Wei gave her another half-bowl of rice gruel. Told her to come back every evening for more. Watched her leave, a skeletal wraith disappearing into the dusk.

Then he sat alone in the temple and pulled out the list.

He stared at the fifteen names. Twelve dead. Three survived or vanished. He thought of the girl's parents, who he had not written down but who belonged on the list anyway. Thought of the whispers: *Everyone he touches dies.*

The pattern was real. He could feel it now, could see the shape of it even if he could not understand the mechanism. Something was wrong. Something beyond war's normal chaos. Something targeting his patients specifically.

Wei's hands clenched involuntarily. Twelve of fifteen dead—the pattern certain, the cause unknown. Why? The question demanded an answer that did not exist. His shoulder seized suddenly, a sharp ache in muscle that had never been wounded, and fury rose in his chest at the absence of explanation. Evidence without mechanism. Pattern without cause. His jaw tightened against words he could not speak: *I don't know why this is happening.* The fury passed as quickly as it came, leaving only a residue of frustration that had no target. Wei unclenched his hands. The answer would not come through anger.

Wei took the list outside and burned it.

He watched the charcoal names smudge and curl as the paper caught fire. Watched the smoke rise into the evening air, carrying the evidence away. The list was gone, but the pattern remained. The knowledge remained. And the count—the terrible, inexorable count—remained most of all.

*One hundred thirty-three saved. One hundred twenty-eight lost.*

Five. He had five left before the ledger inverted, before he had killed more than he had saved. Five lives separating him from a truth he could not accept.

Wei let the paper burn to ash. Ground the ash under his heel. Went back inside to prepare for tomorrow's wounded.

Behind him, the city settled into its nightly rhythm: guards on the walls, families in their quarters, the siege grinding forward one day at a time. Somewhere in the darkness, the girl walked alone through empty streets, carrying the half-bowl of rice like a fragile treasure. And in the temple, Wei knelt before the empty alcove and tried once more to pray.

No words came. Only numbers.

*One hundred thirty-three saved. One hundred twenty-eight lost.*

The pattern was visible now. The whispers were spreading. And Wei had no explanation except the one he refused to speak aloud:

Perhaps they were right. Perhaps he was cursed.

Wei sat with this possibility. Did not flee from it into denial or comfortable explanation. Did not manufacture certainty where none existed. The pattern might be coincidence stretched by grief. Might be curse, if such things were real. Might be something he lacked the categories to comprehend. He could face the uncertainty squarely, without pretending the evidence said what it did not say. Some truths could not be escaped by refusing to look at them.

And if he was cursed, what did that mean for everyone still breathing who had passed through his hands?

The question had no answer. Wei rose, extinguished the lamp, and lay down on his mat in the darkness. Tomorrow would bring more wounded. The count would continue. And the gap—that terrible, narrowing gap—would close further still.

He did not sleep that night. He only counted.

---

The line stretched for blocks.

Wei stood to the side and watched as the treasury official—a thin man in a yellow sash, his face gaunt with the same starvation he was supposed to prevent—distributed the day's rations. Rice for a few. Manna for most. The arithmetic was brutal and visible.

Twenty-five families under Wei's care. He was responsible for their food distribution as Sim a, the lowest rung of the administrative ladder. He had arrived early to collect the allotment: two small bags of rice, one large basket of manna.

The rice would feed perhaps five families adequately. The rest would get weeds.

Wei made the choice the same way he made every choice now: with clinical precision and no illusions.

The children got rice. The elderly got manna. The adults got whatever remained, divided by need and likelihood of survival. A woman nursing an infant: rice. A man already sick with dysentery: manna, because rice would not save him anyway. A family of four, all healthy: half rice, half manna, stretching both as far as they would go.

The families accepted their portions without protest. They had learned not to argue with scarcity. Wei handed out the rations with his face carefully neutral, but inside he felt the weight of every decision, every life calibrated against insufficient resources.

A child looked into her bowl of manna and started crying. Her mother shushed her quickly, too tired for gentleness. The child swallowed her tears and ate.

Wei watched and thought: *This is what the Heavenly Kingdom has become. Children eating weeds while we call it providence.*

By evening, fifty-three people in Wei's ward had developed dysentery.

---

The outbreak started fast and spread faster.

Wei had expected it—contaminated water, nutritionally void food, bodies already weakened by months of deprivation—but the scale still shocked him. By the second day, half the ward was sick. By the third, he had run out of clean cloth for bandages and was using ash to pack wounds because he had nothing else.

The temple floor became a field hospital for a different kind of casualty. Not combat wounds but the slower violence of starvation and disease. People lay in rows, too weak to move, their bowels emptying in liquid streams that stank of rot and blood. Wei and Old Huang and young Ping worked without rest, boiling water, cleaning bodies, trying to keep patients hydrated while their intestines tore themselves apart.

They had no medicine. The Holy Treasury had nothing left. Wei boiled rags and used them to cool foreheads. He made patients drink water until they vomited, then made them drink more. He held them while they convulsed and whispered reassurances he did not believe.

And they died anyway.

An old man. A young mother. A child who had been eating manna for less than a week. The causes were identical: dehydration, electrolyte collapse, organ failure. The bodies piled up faster than Wei could burn them.

On the fourth day, Elder Zhou called Wei to his mat.

Zhou was one of the original believers, a man who had joined the Taiping in the earliest days and had never wavered. Wei had treated him for a minor wound months ago—a cut that had healed cleanly, counted in the ledger as saved. Now Zhou lay dying of dysentery, his body a skeleton draped in loose skin, his breathing shallow and wet.

"Lüshuai," Zhou whispered. "Why does the Heavenly Father allow this?"

Wei knelt beside him. He had no answer that would comfort. No theological explanation that made sense of children dying from eating what their king called manna.

"I don't know," Wei said.

"Perhaps..." Zhou's voice was barely audible. "Perhaps we have sinned. Perhaps the manna is our test. To see if we trust Him even in suffering."

Wei looked at the old man's face—gaunt, faithful, dying because he had trusted a proclamation that called weeds food—and felt something break inside him.

"This is not a test," Wei said quietly. "This is not God."

Zhou's eyes widened. "Lüshuai—"

"This is a man lying to himself while his people starve. The manna is not heaven's provision. It's grass. It's killing you. And calling it divine will not change that."

Silence. Zhou stared at him, too weak to argue, too faithful to accept.

Wei stood. "I'm sorry. I should not have—"

"No." Zhou's hand gripped Wei's wrist with surprising strength. "You spoke truth. I... I needed to hear it."

He died that night. Wei added him to the count and did not pray.

---

By the end of the first week, Wei had stopped tracking the ledger.

The numbers had become meaningless. He did not know who counted as saved anymore—those who survived the manna only to face next week's starvation? Those he kept alive through dysentery so they could die of something else? The categories of saved and lost had collapsed into a single truth: everyone was dying. Wei was only choosing the speed.

He sat in the temple at midnight, the floor finally empty of living patients, and looked at his hands. They were shaking. Not from exhaustion, though he had not slept in four days. From the knowledge that everything he had counted, everything he had tracked and measured and used to justify his work, was a fiction.

The ledger was a lie. The manna was a lie. The Heavenly Kingdom's promise of protection and provision was a lie.

But the work remained.

Wei could have fled. Officers had been deserting for months, slipping through the siege lines to surrender to the Qing or disappearing into the countryside. The city was a tomb. Staying was choosing to die slowly alongside everyone else.

He stayed anyway.

Not because of God. Not because of doctrine. Not because he believed the Heavenly Father would reward his faithfulness or protect his patients. He stayed because the people in his ward needed someone who knew how to boil water and clean wounds and tell them honestly when death was coming.

Function without faith. Duty without hope. The work stripped of everything except the work itself.

Wei stood and walked through the temple. Tomorrow there would be more dysentery. More deaths. More bodies to burn. The manna would keep coming because there was nothing else. The Heavenly King would keep calling it providence because admitting otherwise would shatter what remained of his authority.

And Wei would keep working because stopping would not save anyone.

Outside, the city was silent except for the occasional cough or cry. The siege had progressed beyond desperation into something like resignation. People moved slowly, conserving energy. Speech was minimal. The nightly hymns had stopped weeks ago—no one had the strength to sing.

Wei returned to his mat and lay down. He did not pray. Did not count. Did not think about saved or lost or the ledger that had once given his work meaning.

He thought instead about the girl who came every evening for rice. About Old Huang, still working despite his own hunger. About the child who cried when given manna and ate it anyway because her mother told her to.

These were the truths that remained when theology collapsed. Not salvation. Not divine protection. Just the immediate, fragile fact of bodies that still breathed and might breathe tomorrow if someone helped them.

*We can't save them all, Shufen. Only try.*

His mother's voice had been right all along. Not because trying led to saving. But because trying was what you did when there was nothing else.

Wei closed his eyes. His hands still shook. In the darkness, he could hear someone vomiting in the courtyard—another patient succumbing to the manna's poison. He should get up. Should check on them. Should boil more water.

He would. In a moment. First he needed to rest. Just for a moment.

But sleep would not come. Only the knowledge that tomorrow would be the same as today, and the day after that, and the day after that, until either the siege ended or everyone inside the walls was dead.

Wei lay in the dark and accepted it.

The ledger was closed. The doctrine was ash. And what remained was only the question: If not salvation, then what?

The answer, Wei thought, was simpler than he had believed. Not salvation. Just presence. Just hands that kept working when belief had nothing left to offer.

It was not enough to change anything. But it was what he had.

And so he would give it.

---

By midday, the city had fractured into chaos.

The riot started at the Holy Treasury. A crowd of civilians—skeletal, moving with the jerky urgency of starvation—had stormed the gates demanding food. The treasury was empty. It had been empty for months. But hunger does not accept inventory reports. The crowd surged forward, was met by guards, and the confrontation dissolved into violence.

Wei heard the commotion from the temple—shouts, the crack of wood breaking, a scream that cut off abruptly—but he did not go to investigate. The riot was not his concern. His concern was the temple floor, where three new wounded had arrived.

A man trampled in the crush. Broken ribs, possibly internal bleeding. Wei packed the ribs with bandages and told him to breathe shallowly.

A woman stabbed in the shoulder during a fight over a sack of grain. The grain sack was empty. She had been stabbed over nothing. Wei cleaned the wound, stitched it closed, tried not to think about the futility.

A boy, perhaps twelve, with his arm opened by shrapnel from... something. Wei did not ask. He extracted the metal, packed the wound, bandaged it tight.

The work continued. The city was collapsing, and Wei knelt in the temple applying poultices and counting nothing.

Old Huang worked beside him without speaking. Young Ping had disappeared—fled, perhaps, or caught in the riot. It did not matter. The wounded kept coming.

By sunset, the riot had burned itself out. The Holy Treasury stood looted and empty, which was the same as it had been before, except now the gates were broken and two people were dead. Wei treated the survivors and watched the smoke rise from fires set in the chaos.

The Heavenly King was dead. The Kingdom was dying. And Wei felt the weight of it settle on him like stones piled on his chest.

---

That night, Wei sat in the empty temple and did not move.

He had sent the last wounded away—told them to rest, to come back if the wounds worsened, knowing most would not come back because most would be dead. Old Huang had left to check on his own family. The temple was silent except for the distant sound of weeping somewhere in the city, too far to identify, too constant to ignore.

Wei sat in the empty Buddha alcove where the goddess of mercy had once resided and stared at nothing.

The thought that had been growing for months—hidden, denied, circling like a vulture—finally landed:

*Everyone I help dies.*

Twelve from fifteen. The girl's parents. Chen and the second squad. Elder Zhou. The raid victims. The dysentery cases. On and on. Every person he had saved, every wound he had cleaned and bandaged and counted as victory, had died anyway. Not eventually—quickly. Within weeks or months. Targeted, as if his touch marked them for death.

The pattern was impossible. The pattern was undeniable.

Wei had tried to dismiss it. Confirmation bias. War's ordinary chaos. Bad luck compounded by siege conditions. But the arithmetic would not lie: the ratio had inverted. More lost than saved. The ledger he had kept for twelve years had closed against him.

And now Hong was dead. The Kingdom was dead. And Wei sat in an empty temple and thought: *I am the common factor.*

The conclusion was inescapable. The curse was real.

And if the curse was real, then the only mercy he could offer was to stop.

Wei stood. Walked to his medical bag. Looked at the instruments inside—needles, thread, grinding stone, the last pouches of herbs. His hands, which had touched thousands of wounds, which had saved forty-eight and lost one hundred thirty-three, hung useless at his sides.

He closed the bag. Set it aside. Went back to the alcove and sat down.

Tomorrow, wounded would come. He would tell them to see Old Huang. Or the other medics in the East Ward. Or no one. It did not matter. What mattered was that Wei would not touch them. Would not mark them for death.

He sat in the darkness and waited for the decision to feel like relief.

It felt like drowning.

---

The child came on the third day.

Wei had been sitting for fifty hours. He had not eaten except for half a bowl of manna that Old Huang had forced into his hands. He had not slept. Three wounded had come to the temple in that time. Wei had sent them away. Told them he could not help. Watched them leave, confused and bleeding, and felt nothing.

Old Huang had argued. Had demanded explanations. Wei had given none. Huang had finally left in disgust, muttering about shame and duty. Wei had remained in the alcove, staring at the stone floor, waiting for the curse to lift now that he had stopped feeding it.

The child entered at dawn.

Wei heard him before he saw him—small footsteps, uneven, dragging slightly. Then breathing, shallow and quick. Then silence.

Wei looked up.

The boy stood in the doorway, silhouetted against the pale morning light. Perhaps seven years old. Barefoot, filthy, his tunic torn and stained dark with blood. His left arm hung at his side, bleeding from a deep gash across the forearm. Shrapnel, probably. Or glass from a broken window. The wound was fresh—still flowing, not yet clotted.

The boy stared at Wei. Wei stared back.

Neither spoke.

The moment stretched. The boy swayed slightly, blood dripping to the stone floor in slow, rhythmic drops. Wei sat motionless in the alcove, his medical bag three paces away, his hands empty.

*If I help him,* Wei thought, *he will die.*

The pattern was certain. The curse was proven. Every person Wei touched was marked. The boy was bleeding now, but that wound was survivable. What would kill him was Wei's intervention—the invisible machinery of death that followed Wei's patients like a shadow.

*Let him go,* Wei thought. *Let him find someone else. Anyone else.*

The boy took a step forward. His face was pale, shock-smoothed, but his eyes were fixed on Wei with an animal certainty: *You are the medic. You help.*

Wei looked at the wound. Saw the blood. Saw the depth of the cut—not arterial, but deep enough to need stitching. Saw the boy's shallow breathing, the beginning of shock.

*If I help him, he will die. The walls will break. The city will fall. He will die in the massacre or the famine or the disease. Helping him now only delays it.*

The thought was clean, logical, irrefutable.

And underneath it, quieter, something else:

*But he's bleeding now.*

Wei stood.

His legs were stiff from sitting. He walked to his medical bag, knelt, opened it. The instruments were still there, waiting. Needle and thread. Clean cloth. A small jar of honey-garlic paste.

The boy watched, silent.

Wei gestured to the floor. "Sit."

The boy sat.

Wei knelt beside him and examined the wound. Deep. Ragged edges. Would scar badly even with stitching. He cleaned it with boiled water from the bucket Old Huang had left, working quickly, his hands moving through motions so familiar they required no thought.

The boy gasped but did not cry. Wei packed the wound with paste, threaded the needle, began stitching.

*It doesn't matter if I'm cursed,* Wei thought. *He needs help.*

The realization was not dramatic. Not a revelation. Just a fact, simple and irreducible: the wound was real. The bleeding was immediate. The boy needed stitches, and Wei knew how to give them.

What happened after—whether the boy lived or died, whether the curse followed or the walls fell or the Kingdom collapsed—was not in Wei's control. Had never been in his control. The ledger had been a fiction from the beginning, a story he told himself to make the work bearable.

But the work itself was not fiction. The wound was real. The stitching was real. The boy's breathing, shallow and quick, was real.

Wei tied off the last stitch and bandaged the arm.

"Keep it clean," he said. "Come back in three days if it smells sweet or the skin goes hot."

The boy nodded. Stood. Looked at Wei with something that might have been gratitude or might have been simple exhaustion.

He left without speaking.

Wei watched him go. Watched him walk through the temple gate into the morning light, one arm cradled against his chest, his bare feet silent on the stone.

*When the walls break,* Wei thought, *he'll die anyway. But not from this wound. Not today.*

He turned back to the temple. The floor needed washing—blood had pooled where the boy had sat. His tools needed cleaning. There would be more wounded. There were always more.

Wei picked up his bag and went back to work.

Outside, the siege continued. The Qing guns fired. The walls held. And in the empty palace, the Heavenly King's body was being prepared for burial in a coffin lined with yellow silk, his ascension to heaven already fading into rumor and myth.

Wei did not pray for him. Did not count him as saved or lost. Did not add him to any ledger.

He only cleaned his tools and waited for the next wounded to arrive.

The curse, if it had ever been real, no longer mattered. The boy's wound had been real. Wei had stitched it. That was enough.

It was all there had ever been.

---

Wei followed at a distance.

Not to escape. He had no intention of leaving the temple's wounded unattended at the end. But he could at least see them to the gate. Could at least witness what happened.

The streets were apocalyptic. Smoke hung thick, turning the morning light orange and sick. Bodies lay in the gutters—civilians cut down while fleeing, soldiers killed at their posts. The gunfire was constant now, echoing from the West Wall where Qing forces were pouring into the city.

Wei walked behind the group, watching. They moved quickly, staying together as he'd instructed. Captain Zhou led from the front, his spear raised, shouting orders Wei couldn't hear over the chaos.

They passed a burning building. A child crying over a body. A group of soldiers running the opposite direction, their faces blank with terror.

Wei saw a woman in the crowd ahead—her profile, the way she carried herself—and something tightened in his chest.

*Mei?*

His sister. Or someone who looked like his sister. He hadn't seen her in thirteen years—not since the Taiping segregation laws separated men and women into different districts. She would be older now. Different. But the shape of her was familiar, or he thought it was, or he wanted it to be.

"Mei!" he called.

She didn't turn. Too far ahead, or the name was wrong, or she had forgotten him.

The group reached the West Gate plaza. Wei stopped at the edge, fifty paces back, watching from the shadow of a collapsed wall.

The gate was open. Beyond it: fields, smoke, the distant river. Escape was possible. Zhou was leading them through—

And then the cavalry appeared.

Qing horsemen, perhaps thirty strong, emerging from the smoke like they had been waiting. Like they had known exactly when and where the refugees would appear.

Wei watched as the formation wheeled into position. Watched as the order was given. Watched as the lances dropped and the horses charged.

The civilians scattered. Screamed. Ran in every direction.

It made no difference.

The cavalry cut through them like scissors through silk. Methodical. Efficient. Wei saw Captain Zhou go down with a lance through his chest. Saw the young woman who had clutched his arm trampled beneath hooves. Saw the woman who might have been his sister—or wasn't, he would never know—cut down from behind, her body crumpling into the mud.

In less than a minute, it was over.

Wei stood at the edge of the plaza and watched the bodies settle. Ninety people. Now zero. The evacuation he had organized, the people he had sent to safety, all dead.

He had saved no one.

The cavalry wheeled again, searching for more targets. Wei stepped back into the shadow before they saw him. Turned. Walked back the way he had come.

The temple was two streets away. The wounded were still there, waiting. He had promised he would not leave them.

Wei walked through the smoke and the screaming and the bodies and felt nothing.

The trying had mattered. The outcome had not.

---

Inside the temple, the forty wounded waited in silence.

They had heard the evacuation. Heard the group leave. Heard the screaming from the plaza, distant but unmistakable. Now they lay on the stone floor and listened to the gunfire getting closer.

Wei entered. Closed the door behind him. It would not hold—the Qing would break through in minutes—but it gave the illusion of shelter.

He knelt beside the nearest wounded man. Checked his pulse. Still strong. Still alive for now.

"Lüshuai," a voice said. Wei looked up. The boy—seventeen, maybe younger, wounded in the leg during the riot weeks ago. His face was pale, his breathing shallow. "Will it hurt?"

Wei looked at him. Thought about Jean, about honesty. Thought about compassion. Chose both.

"No," he lied gently. "It will be quick."

The boy's face relaxed slightly. Not reassured, but comforted by the kindness.

Wei moved among the wounded, checking each one. Some were unconscious. Some watched him with wide, terrified eyes. Some prayed—quiet Taiping prayers, invoking the Heavenly Father and the Heavenly King, theology that had already collapsed but still offered the comfort of familiar words.

Wei did not pray.

He knelt beside the boy again and took his hand. The boy's fingers were cold, trembling. Wei held them steady.

Outside, the screaming was getting closer. Boots on stone. Orders shouted in the Xiang Army dialect. The Qing was clearing the streets, building by building.

Wei stayed.

Not because God commanded it. Not because the Kingdom required it. Not because he believed it would save anyone.

He stayed because the boy's hand was cold, and holding it was warm. Because the wounded were terrified, and presence mattered. Because this was what he did.

Outcome-independent. Purified.

The footsteps reached the temple door. Wei heard voices outside—soldiers confirming the building, reporting back to their commander. The door rattled. Held for a moment.

Then splintered.

The boy's hand tightened in his. Wei squeezed back.

"It's all right," Wei whispered.

The door broke open. Sunlight flooded in, dusty and red with smoke. Silhouettes filled the doorway—soldiers, armed with spears and dao swords.

Wei looked up at them. Held the boy's hand.

And waited.

---

Wei stood.

Not to fight. Not to flee. Just to stand between the soldiers and the wounded for as long as he could.

His hands were empty. No weapon. No medical bag. Just his body, thin and exhausted, a barrier that would accomplish nothing.

The boy called out: "Lüshuai—"

"It's all right," Wei said.

The sergeant stepped forward. Raised his spear.

Wei raised his hands. Not surrender. Not supplication. Just: *I am not a threat.*

The gesture bought him ten seconds.

That was all.

The sergeant's face was professionally blank. He had done this before. Would do it again. In a siege city where quarter was not given, mercy was a luxury neither side could afford.

"I'm sorry," the sergeant said.

Wei believed him.

The spear punched through Wei's chest.

Fast. Clean. The sergeant had been trained well. The blade entered just below the sternum, angled upward, found the heart. Wei felt the pressure—a terrible, invasive wrongness—and then the pain.

Sharp. Bright. Consuming.

He fell backward. The spear withdrew. Wei landed on the stone floor, his head striking the ground hard enough to blur his vision.

Above him, the temple ceiling. Wooden beams, smoke-stained and ancient. Dusty sunlight filtering through the gaps where artillery had damaged the roof.

The screaming started.

The soldiers moved through the temple methodically, killing the wounded where they lay. Wei heard it but could not turn his head to see. Could only stare at the ceiling and listen.

Spears striking flesh. Wet, final sounds. Men crying out, then falling silent.

The boy's voice: "No, please—"

Cut off.

Wei tried to breathe. His lungs would not fill. The air came wet, bubbling. He tasted copper. Blood in his mouth, in his throat.

His vision narrowed. Tunnel vision, darkening at the edges.

The smell of incense. Faint, underneath the blood and smoke. Old temple smell, lingering from before the goddess was smashed and the holy icons were destroyed. His mother's temple had smelled like this. Sandalwood and ash.

The stone was cold beneath his back. His blood was warm, spreading in a pool around him.

The screaming stopped. One by one, the voices cut off. Until the temple was silent except for the soldiers' boots on stone and Wei's own breathing—wet, failing, slowing.

He could not feel his legs. Could not feel his hands.

His vision darkened further. A tunnel of light, narrowing.

And in that tunnel, a thought. Clear and certain, untouched by pain or fear:

*I saved no one.*

*The walls fell. The kingdom fell. Every hand I held went cold.*

*But the holding was not nothing.*

*The trying is never nothing.*

*I will try again.*

The light narrowed to a point.

And went out.

---

Wei Shufen died on the stone floor of a temple that had once been consecrated to Guanyin, the goddess of mercy.

His body lay among forty others—soldiers, civilians, the wounded he had refused to abandon. Blood pooled around him, darkening the stone. His eyes were open, staring at the ceiling. One hand was still reaching toward where the boy had been, frozen mid-gesture.

Outside, the massacre continued. The Qing forces swept through Tianjing street by street, building by building. No quarter was given. No prisoners were taken. By nightfall, the city would be a graveyard.

But that was later.

For now, Wei's body lay in the dusty sunlight. The ledger he had kept for twelve years—forty-eight saved, twenty-three lost, then more, then less, then abandoned—was closed.

The numbers no longer mattered.

They had never mattered.

What mattered was the trying. The hands held. The wounds cleaned. The presence offered in the final moments.

Outcome-independent.

Purified.

The eighth perfection, achieved through futility.

The Xiang Army sergeant paused at the temple door on his way out. Looked back at the bodies. Saw the medic's body, his hand still reaching.

He did not pray. Did not speak. Just looked.

And moved on.

The war continued. The Kingdom of Heavenly Peace fell. History recorded the Taiping Rebellion as one of the deadliest conflicts in human history—twenty million dead, cities destroyed, dynasties shaken.

Wei Shufen was not recorded. His name appeared in no histories. The ledger he kept was lost in the fires. The patients he saved—and the ones he lost—were forgotten.

But the trying was not nothing.

And somewhere, in a pattern neither Wei nor the soldiers nor the historians would ever see, the seed of that trying took root.

*I will try again.*
