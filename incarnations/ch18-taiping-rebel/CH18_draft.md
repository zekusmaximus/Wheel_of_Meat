# Scene 1: The Arithmetic

Wei Shufen knelt in the light and counted the dying.

Seven men lay on the stone floor of what had once been a temple to Guanyin. The goddess was gone—her alcove empty, the plaster smashed to make lime for the walls—but her mercy had seeped into the stones. The morning sun cut through smoke and dust, illuminating nothing sacred, only the arithmetic of triage.

Wei's hands moved without thought. Herb-stained fingers pressed a poultice of yarrow and comfrey against a shoulder wound, checking for the heat of infection beneath crusted blood. The man beneath him—Chen, a spearman from the second platoon—had taken a Qing musket ball in the night's skirmish. The ball had passed through cleanly. Lucky. Chen would live.

Wei moved to the next man. Then the next. His assessment was silent, clinical, and absolute.

*Four will live if I have the supplies. Two might live if I make the right choices. One will die no matter what I do.*

The last man had a gut wound. Wei could see the gray-green of exposed intestine through the torn tunic, could smell the septic sweetness already blooming. Three days, perhaps four. He gave the man water—forbidden, it would hasten the end—and moved on. Some mercy required disobedience.

The "might live" cases were the burden. They consumed resources that could save three certain survivors. But Wei had learned, over twelve years of war, that certainty was a poor physician. He treated them anyway. His mother had taught him that in the hills of Guangxi, before the Heavenly Kingdom, before God descended to reclaim China from the demons.

*We can't save them all, Shufen. Only try.*

Her voice in his memory was steady, practical. She had been a Hakka herbalist, a woman who walked barefoot through mountain villages with a bag of remedies and no illusions. Cholera had taken her in '54, here in Tianjing, in the third year of God's reign. She had given Wei her knowledge before she died: which roots stopped bleeding, which poultices drew infection, which wounds were mortal no matter how much you wanted them not to be.

He finished his assessment and sat back on his heels. The temple floor was cold beneath him despite the spring warmth outside. Behind him, through the empty Buddha alcove, he could see the West Wall where his men stood watch. The siege had not yet strangled the city—food was rationed but sufficient, water still flowed from the wells—but the Qing had been tightening their grip for months. The skirmishes came every few days now. Probes. Testing.

Wei stood and reached for his medical bag. Scavenged Qing leather, worn soft by use, heavy with the weight of what remained: needles, silk thread, a grinding stone, pouches of herbs that grew thinner each month. He had learned to make do. Boiled cloth for bandages when silk ran out. Ash to pack wounds when salves were gone. The body had simple needs. Clean the wound. Stop the bleeding. Let it heal or let it kill quickly.

He knelt beside the worst of the "might live" cases—a young soldier named Zhao with shrapnel buried deep in his shoulder. The metal had to come out or the wound would rot from the inside.

"This will hurt," Wei said. His voice was soft, matter-of-fact. "Do you want something to bite?"

Zhao shook his head. He was perhaps nineteen, his face still unlined beneath the grime. "Will I keep the arm, Lüshuai?"

"If the metal comes out clean."

"Then do it."

Wei had no opium. The Heavenly King had banned it, rightly, as demon poison. Alcohol was forbidden for the same reason. Wei had only his hands and the certainty that infection killed slower than blood loss but just as thoroughly.

He worked quickly. Fingers probing the wound, feeling for the foreign shape embedded in meat. Zhao's breath came in short gasps but he did not scream. Good. Screaming tensed the muscles, made the work harder. Wei found the shrapnel—a jagged piece of iron, Qing canister shot—and gripped it between thumb and forefinger.

"Now," he said, and pulled.

Zhao screamed then. The shrapnel came free with a wet sound and a gout of dark blood. Wei dropped the metal into a bowl and pressed a wad of boiled cloth against the wound, holding pressure while Zhao's screams dissolved into ragged breathing. The bleeding slowed. Stopped. Wei packed the wound with a paste of honey and crushed garlic—what he had left—and bound it tight.

"Keep it clean," Wei said. "Come back in three days. If it smells sweet, come back sooner."

Zhao nodded, too spent to speak. Wei helped him to his feet and watched him stagger toward the door, one arm cradled against his chest. He would live. Probably. If the wound stayed clean. If infection didn't take root in the microscopic fragments Wei's fingers had missed. If, if, if.

Wei moved through the rest of the wounded with the same methodical care. A spear cut along the ribs—shallow, would heal on its own. A musket graze across the forearm—cleaned and bandaged. A broken hand from a fall during the retreat—splinted with strips of bamboo. By the time he finished, the sun had climbed higher, burning off the morning haze. The man with the gut wound had died. Wei closed his eyes and added him to the count.

*Forty-seven saved. Twenty-three lost.*

The numbers lived in Wei's mind like a second heartbeat, constant and inescapable. He had started counting in 1853, when the Heavenly Kingdom first took Tianjing and the wounded had flooded in by the hundreds. Twelve years of names and faces, most forgotten, all tallied. It was compulsive, he knew. A need to track, to measure, to prove his hands could do more good than harm. His mother would have called it pride dressed as duty. But she was dead and the count continued.

Someone cleared their throat behind him. Wei turned to see Chen, the spearman with the shoulder wound, standing at the temple entrance. He had been one of Wei's patients a month ago—a sword cut across the thigh that had wanted to go septic but hadn't. Now he stood whole, ready to return to the wall.

"Lüshuai," Chen said. "Wanted to thank you. For last month."

Wei nodded. "The wound healed well?"

"Clean as new skin." Chen grinned, gap-toothed and young. "Shishuai says I'm back on the duty roster tomorrow. West Wall, night watch."

"Good. Keep the shoulder dry for another week."

Chen saluted—the Taiping fist-over-heart—and left. Wei watched him go, watched him walk through the temple gate into the sunlit street where soldiers drilled and civilians carried water from the wells and the Heavenly Kingdom continued its slow work of remaking the world in God's image. Chen's red tunic, faded to rust-brown like all of them, disappeared into the crowd.

Wei felt the small, quiet satisfaction of work completed. Chen would live. Would fight. Would serve the Heavenly Father's purpose. The arithmetic balanced in Wei's favor: forty-eight saved, twenty-three lost.

He did not know that Chen's unit would be ambushed the next night during a raid on the Qing siege works. Did not know that a cannonball would take him in the chest, killing him so quickly he would not suffer. Did not know that in the grand accounting, the ledger was already turning against him.

Wei only knew what his hands could do: clean wounds, set bones, give water to the dying. The rest was God's will.

He turned back to the temple. The floor needed washing—blood had pooled in the cracks between stones—and his tools needed cleaning before the next wounded arrived. There was always a next. The walls held, but the Qing pressed closer each week, and the siege had years left to run.

At sunset, Wei stood in the temple doorway and looked west toward the wall. Soldiers moved along the parapet, shadows against the orange sky. Smoke rose from cooking fires throughout the ward. Somewhere a child laughed, the sound strange and precious in a city at war. Wei's hands were clean now, scrubbed with harsh soap until the herb stains showed dark against pale skin. They trembled slightly—exhaustion, not fear—and he clasped them together to still them.

*Forty-eight saved,* he thought. *Twenty-three lost.*

Behind him, the empty alcove where Guanyin had once sat stared back with its hollow absence. The goddess of mercy was gone, but the work remained. Wei would kneel again tomorrow when the wounded came. He would count them, treat them, save the ones he could. The ledger would grow.

He did not know that the numbers would invert within two years. Did not know that the ratio of saved to lost would collapse, then reverse, until the arithmetic itself became unbearable. Did not know that someone watched from a place outside time, arranging coincidences with the patience of someone who had already lost everything and was now losing time itself.

Wei only knew that Chen was healed and walking and alive, and that was enough for today.

He went back inside to prepare for tomorrow's wounded.

# Scene 2: The First Fracture

Three months later, the count was seventy-one saved, fifty-eight lost, and the temple floor was a lake of blood.

Wei moved through the chaos with his hands already red to the wrists. Thirty bodies, perhaps more—he had stopped counting when the screaming made numbers meaningless. They came in waves: carried by comrades, dragged by family, crawling on their own. An artillery barrage had caught the West Ward market at midday. Qing guns firing blind over the walls, the shells landing where civilians queued for their rice ration.

The wounded filled the temple floor, spilling out into the courtyard. Wei's two assistants—Old Huang and a teenager named Ping—worked without speaking, their movements sharp and economical. There was no time for gentleness. No time for anything but the calculus.

Wei knelt beside a woman with her leg opened to the bone, assessed the arterial spray—survivable if he could stop it now—and moved to the next. A man missing his left hand at the wrist, the stump already tourniqueted with torn cloth. Delayed. A child with shrapnel embedded in her skull, unconscious, pupils blown. Expectant. He touched her forehead once, gently, and moved on.

*Immediate. Delayed. Expectant.*

The categories were clean. The reality was not.

A man grabbed Wei's ankle as he passed. "Lüshuai, my brother—"

"Let me see him."

The man's brother had a gut wound. Wei saw the gray loops of intestine spilling through torn cloth, saw the way the man's breathing had gone shallow and rapid, saw the beginning of shock in his unfocused eyes. He had seen this wound a hundred times. It always ended the same way.

"Give him water," Wei said. "Stay with him."

"But you can—"

"No." Wei pulled his ankle free, not unkindly. "I can't. Give him water. Let him rest."

He moved on before the man could argue. Behind him, he heard weeping. He did not look back.

The work consumed him. Hands probing wounds, checking pulses, making decisions that would ripple forward into life or death. A spear of wood through a thigh—pulled it out, packed the wound, survivable. A chest crushed by falling debris—nothing to be done. A scalp laid open to the skull—would heal if kept clean. The triage sorted them into piles: those who would live with help, those who would die without immediate intervention, those who would die regardless.

Wei worked on the first group. Old Huang and Ping worked on the second. The third group received water and a place to lie down and nothing else. Resources were finite. Wei had learned long ago that mercy meant choosing who received it.

By the time the sun reached its zenith, Wei's legs were numb from kneeling and his hands shook with exhaustion. He had lost count of the wounded. Fifty? Sixty? The numbers blurred together, united only by their bleeding. He sat back on his heels and let Old Huang press a cup of water into his hands.

"Drink," Huang said. "You're no use dead."

Wei drank. The water tasted of dust and copper—blood in the air, in his mouth, everywhere. Around him, the screaming had diminished to moans and ragged breathing. The worst of the crisis was past. Now came the waiting: for wounds to close or reopen, for infection to take root or be turned back, for the arithmetic to resolve itself into saved or lost.

A voice spoke behind him. Small, uncertain. "Lüshuai?"

Wei turned.

The girl stood in the temple doorway, silhouetted against the bright courtyard. She was perhaps ten years old, thin as famine, with a bloodied cloth wrapped around her left leg. Behind her, the courtyard was empty except for two bodies covered with torn cloth.

Wei knew her face. He had seen it a month ago in this same temple, when he had treated her mother for fever and sent the family to safety outside the walls. A village three li west, beyond the Qing siege lines, where civilians could farm and escape the crowding and disease of the city. He had thought it a mercy.

"Where are your parents?" Wei asked, though he already knew.

The girl looked at the covered bodies. Her face was blank, shock-smoothed. "The demons shelled the village. Mama and Baba..." She swallowed. "Everyone died. We came back."

Wei stood. His knees cracked. He walked to the girl and knelt again, this time to examine her leg. The wound was fresh—shrapnel, small fragment embedded in the calf. Not deep. Survivable. He worked quickly, fingers probing around the metal, feeling for the angle of entry.

"This will hurt," he said.

She nodded.

He pulled the shrapnel free in one smooth motion. The girl gasped but did not cry. Wei packed the wound with paste and bound it tightly. His hands moved through the familiar motions while his mind circled a single thought:

*I sent them to safety. I told them the village was far enough from the walls.*

"Keep it clean," Wei said. "Come back if it smells sweet or the skin goes hot."

The girl nodded again. She looked at the covered bodies. "Can I...?"

"Yes. Take your time."

She limped to her parents and knelt between them. Wei watched for a moment, then turned back to the wounded. There were still three men in the expectant category, still breathing, still waiting for the mercy of water or death. He could do nothing for them but be present.

The man with the gut wound died first. His brother held him until the end, whispering prayers to the Heavenly Father. Wei helped move the body outside. Then the second man—chest crushed, drowned slowly in his own blood. Then the third, who simply stopped breathing between one moment and the next.

By sunset, Wei had counted the cost. Forty-three treated. Seven dead. The rest would live or die based on factors beyond his control: infection, blood loss, the strength of their bodies and the will of God.

He stood in the courtyard and watched Old Huang light the pyre. Disease control required it—bodies could not be left to rot in summer heat. The smoke rose black and thick, carrying the smell of burning flesh that Wei had learned not to think about. The girl sat nearby, silent, watching her parents burn.

Wei's mind performed its accounting. The family: he had saved them from fever last month. He had sent them away to the village. They had died anyway. Did they count as saved? As lost? The arithmetic did not have a category for this.

He tried the numbers anyway. Seventy-one saved, fifty-eight lost. The mother and father—saved once, lost later. The girl—saved twice now, once from fever and once from shrapnel. Did that count as two? Or was a life only counted when it reached its end?

*We can't save them all, Shufen. Only try.*

His mother's voice was no comfort tonight. He had tried. He had sent them to safety. They had died anyway, and now the girl sat watching her parents burn with the same blank expression she had worn when she arrived.

Wei looked at his hands. They were clean now, scrubbed until the herb stains showed dark against pale skin, but he could still feel the blood. Slick between his fingers. Warm when it first spilled. Cooling as men died.

The count was incomplete. The ledger would not close cleanly. But the gap was narrowing—seventy-one to fifty-eight—and for the first time, Wei felt the future pressing down on him like a physical weight. The ratio could not hold. The siege was tightening. The wounded would keep coming. And somewhere in the invisible machinery of war, decisions were being made that he could neither see nor control.

He did not know that the artillery strike had been no accident, that the timing had been adjusted by a hand reaching back through time to ensure maximum casualties in that specific market at that specific hour. Did not know that the village he had sent the family to had been targeted deliberately, the Qing guns directed by intelligence that should not have existed.

He only knew that he had sent them to safety and they had died.

The smoke rose into the evening sky. The girl finally stood, limped back into the temple without a word, and curled up in a corner near the empty Buddha alcove. Wei watched her for a long moment, then turned back to his work. The tools needed cleaning. The floor needed washing. Tomorrow there would be more wounded.

*Seventy-one saved,* he thought. *Fifty-eight lost.*

The gap was closing. He did not know why. He only knew that the arithmetic, once so certain, had begun to feel like a lie he told himself to make the work bearable.

Inside the temple, in the growing dark, the girl slept or pretended to sleep. Wei let her. Outside, the pyre burned down to ash and bone. The smoke dispersed. The city settled into its nightly rhythm: guards on the walls, families in their quarters, the siege grinding forward one day at a time.

Wei knelt in the empty temple and tried to pray. The words would not come. He settled for silence instead, his hands clasped together, his mind counting and recounting numbers that refused to balance.

Behind him, the empty alcove stared back with its hollow absence. The goddess of mercy was gone, and the ledger was closing.

# Scene 3: The Doctrine

The preacher's voice echoed through the repurposed Confucian hall, fierce and certain, proclaiming truths that Wei could no longer see.

"The Heavenly Father shields the righteous!" The man paced across the platform where Confucius had once been honored, his red tunic bright against the faded yellow banners that proclaimed the glory of God's kingdom. "The demons' bullets cannot touch the faithful! Their cannon cannot breach our walls while we stand in His grace!"

Wei sat among the officers, hands folded in his lap, and counted the dying men in the congregation.

Three rows ahead: the soldier with gangrene creeping up his arm, the flesh already blackening despite the poultices. He had perhaps a week. Two rows to the left: the man coughing blood into a rag, the wet rattle of tuberculosis unmistakable. A month, maybe less. Behind Wei, close enough to hear his labored breathing: a soldier whose belly wound had seemed to heal, then reopened, the infection now spreading through tissue no medicine could reach.

All of them sat upright, listening, singing when the hymns came, their faces lifted toward the promise of divine protection while their bodies rotted from within.

Wei felt the gap between doctrine and reality like a physical thing, a chasm opening in his chest. He did not doubt God—the Heavenly Father was real, Christ was real, the Kingdom was real. But the promise of invulnerability rang hollow when he spent his days elbow-deep in wounds that should not have happened to the faithful.

"The demons fear us!" the preacher continued. "They cower before the might of the Lord! We are invincible in His love!"

The congregation murmured agreement. Wei said nothing.

The hymn began without warning, hundreds of voices rising in ragged unity. Wei stood with the others and sang, his voice low, the words familiar but emptied of meaning:

*The Lord protects His children,*
*No blade can pierce His shield,*
*The demons flee before us,*
*Their armies broken, they yield—*

Wei's eyes drifted to the empty altar where Confucius's tablet had once stood. The Taiping had smashed it years ago, along with every Buddhist statue and Daoist shrine they could find. Idolatry, they said. Demon worship. Only the Heavenly Father deserved reverence.

The irony was not lost on Wei: they had destroyed one set of certainties to build another, and both seemed equally unable to stop men from bleeding.

The service ended. The congregation dispersed. Wei remained seated as the hall emptied, watching the sick men shuffle toward the doors, some leaning on comrades, others walking with the careful slowness of those trying not to jar infected wounds. None of them would survive the winter. Wei knew this with the certainty of experience. The Heavenly Father's shield had not stopped the bullets that wounded them, and it would not stop the infections that would kill them.

"Lüshuai Wei."

Wei turned. Shishuai Fang stood in the aisle, his colonel's insignia—a yellow cloth badge sewn to his tunic—faded to the color of old mustard. Fang was forty, lean as jerky, his face weathered by twelve years of war. A competent officer. A believer, but not a fanatic. The kind of man who could give terrible orders without cruelty, simply because the hierarchy demanded it.

"Shishuai," Wei said, standing.

"Walk with me."

They left the hall and walked through the West Ward's narrow streets. The autumn air was cool, carrying the smell of cook fires and sewage and the ever-present dust. Civilians moved past them with the dull efficiency of people who had learned to conserve energy—no wasted motion, no unnecessary speech. The siege was tightening. Food rations had been cut twice in the past month.

Fang did not speak until they reached the defensive earthworks at the base of the West Wall. He stopped, looked up at the ramparts where soldiers stood watch, then turned to Wei.

"I need twenty men," Fang said. "For a raid tonight. Qing supply depot, two li north. Intelligence says it's lightly guarded."

Wei's stomach tightened. "I have twenty-three men currently recovering. Most are not ready for—"

"I need twenty." Fang's voice was flat, neutral. Not a request.

"Shishuai, their wounds are not fully healed. Some still have infections. If they march, if they fight—"

"The Heavenly King requires this raid." Fang met Wei's eyes. "The depot has food. Medicine. We need it."

Wei understood what was not being said: the decision had already been made above Fang's head, passed down through the chain of command from some King or commissioner who had never touched a wound or watched gangrene spread. Fang was merely the instrument of transmission.

"They will die," Wei said quietly.

"Then they die in service to God." Fang's expression did not change. "Release them. By sunset."

Wei could have refused. Could have argued that his medical judgment should override tactical necessity, that sending wounded men to fight was murder dressed as duty. But he had learned, over twelve years, that the system did not care about individual wisdom. Refusing would accomplish nothing except his removal from command. Someone else would release the men. The raid would proceed. And Wei would lose the small authority that allowed him to save anyone at all.

He was a cog in a machine. The machine did not stop for moral objections.

"Yes, Shishuai," Wei said.

That evening, Wei selected twenty men whose wounds had closed enough to walk. He did not choose the strongest—those he kept back, knowing they might survive the next crisis. He chose the marginal cases: infections that might spread or might resolve, fractures that might hold or might shatter under stress. The ones whose survival was uncertain anyway.

He told himself this was pragmatism. He did not examine it too closely.

The men assembled in the courtyard at dusk. Wei checked their bandages, tightened the ones that had loosened, told them to keep their wounds dry and clean. Instructions that would be impossible to follow in combat. They nodded anyway, their faces set with the grim determination of men who understood they were being spent.

One of them—a young soldier named Ping, no relation to Wei's assistant—gripped Wei's arm as he passed. "Lüshuai, will the Heavenly Father protect us?"

Wei looked at him. Nineteen years old. Spear wound through the shoulder, barely healed. He would not survive close combat.

"Obey your officers," Wei said. "Stay in formation. Keep your wound covered."

It was not an answer. Ping accepted it anyway.

The raid departed at midnight. Wei did not watch them go. He returned to the temple and tried to sleep.

---

They returned at dawn. Two of them.

Wei heard the commotion in the courtyard and rose from his mat, already reaching for his medical bag. By the time he reached the temple entrance, Old Huang had the survivors on the floor, their wounds reopened and bleeding fresh.

"Ambush," one of them gasped. Blood bubbled at the corner of his mouth—lung wound, possibly. "They knew we were coming. They were waiting."

Wei knelt and began working. The man's shoulder wound had torn open completely, the careful stitching ripped apart. Wei packed it with cloth, applied pressure, knew it was futile. Too much blood loss. Too much damage. The man would be dead by midday.

The second survivor was conscious but silent, his face gray with shock. His leg wound had opened and infection was already visible—the flesh hot and red, the smell wrong. Wei cleaned it, knowing he was only prolonging the inevitable.

"Eighteen?" Wei asked.

The conscious man nodded. "Dead. All of them. It was..." He stopped, swallowed. "Like they knew exactly where we'd be."

Wei said nothing. Intelligence failures happened. Spies happened. Betrayal happened. This was war, and war was chaos. There was no pattern to see, only the endless grinding of men into meat.

The first man died an hour later. The second lasted until evening, then succumbed to the infection that had already been spreading before the raid.

Wei burned their bodies that night and updated his count.

*One hundred and three saved. Ninety-seven lost.*

The gap was six. Only six. The ledger was approaching equilibrium, and Wei felt the weight of it like stones piled on his chest. He had saved one hundred and three men in twelve years of war. He had lost ninety-seven. The ratio had held for so long—always more saved than lost, always tipping toward life. Now it teetered on the edge of inversion.

He sat in the temple as the pyre burned outside, the smoke rising into the autumn night. The empty Buddha alcove stared at him from the wall. Wei knelt before it out of habit, folded his hands, tried to pray.

No words came.

He thought of the twenty men he had released to die. Thought of Fang's flat voice: *The Heavenly King requires it.* Thought of the preacher's proclamation: *The demons' bullets cannot touch the faithful.*

The doctrine said one thing. The bodies said another.

Wei remained kneeling, not in prayer but in exhaustion, while outside the pyre collapsed into ash and embers. The count was one hundred three saved, ninety-seven lost, and the gap was closing with a speed that felt like drowning.

Behind him, the temple was silent except for the breathing of the new wounded who had already arrived. Tomorrow there would be more. There were always more.

Wei did not know that the intelligence leak had been no accident, that the raid's timing and route had been exposed by manipulation so subtle it looked like ordinary treachery. Did not know that eighteen deaths were being tallied in a ledger not his own, counted as successes in a war he could not see.

He only knew that he had obeyed, and men had died, and the Heavenly Father's protection had been nowhere in evidence.

He stood, finally, and returned to his work. The ledger would not close itself. The wounded would not heal themselves. And the doctrine, for all its certainty, offered nothing but words while Wei's hands were required to offer blood and bone and the pragmatic mercy of knowing when to stop trying.

The night deepened. The pyre burned low. And in the temple, Wei counted his supplies and calculated how long they would last before the next impossible choice arrived.

**Word count: 1,728**
# Scene 4: The Pattern

Wei made lists now.

He sat at a makeshift desk—a plank balanced across two stones in the corner of the temple—with a stub of charcoal and a scrap of paper scavenged from the Holy Treasury's dwindling supplies. The list contained fifteen names. Fifteen men and women he had personally saved and tracked over the past year. He had chosen them deliberately: patients whose survival had been certain, whose wounds had healed cleanly, who had walked out of his temple whole and alive.

The obsession had started small. A mental note here, a question there. *Whatever happened to Chen? To the woman with the fever? To the soldier whose hand I saved?* But the mental notes had accumulated into a catalog, and the catalog had demanded accounting. So now Wei kept a physical list, and he was checking it methodically, one name at a time.

The arithmetic was impossible.

He had asked after each of the fifteen. Some he found himself—walked through the West Ward to their assigned quarters, spoke to their families, saw the evidence with his own eyes. Others he traced through inquiry, asking officers and administrators and fellow medics until he learned their fates.

Fifteen names. Twelve dead.

Wei stared at the list in the morning light. His charcoal had smudged where his fingers gripped the paper too tightly.

Chen: killed in night raid (the one Fang had ordered).
Liu: died two days after leaving the temple, supposedly from a stray bullet during wall duty.
The woman with fever: succumbed to different illness a month after recovery.
The man whose leg he'd saved: executed for desertion (charges unclear).
The soldier with the shoulder wound: killed when his barracks collapsed during shelling.

On and on. Twelve dead from fifteen tracked. The causes varied—combat, disease, accident, execution—but the result was uniform. Dead. All dead. Within weeks or months of their supposed salvation.

The three survivors: one was Old Huang himself, still working beside Wei. One was a civilian woman who had left the city entirely, fled during a brief opening in the siege lines. The third was a soldier transferred to the East Wall, out of Wei's sight and therefore uncountable.

Twelve from fifteen. Eighty percent mortality among patients he had personally verified as saved.

The mathematics made no sense. Soldiers died—that was war. Civilians died—that was siege. But the rate should have been closer to general attrition: perhaps forty percent over a year, fifty at most. Not eighty. Not concentrated so specifically among those Wei had touched and tracked.

He folded the paper and tucked it into his tunic. The numbers would not change by staring at them.

"You're tracking ghosts, Shufen."

Wei looked up. Old Huang stood in the temple entrance, arms crossed, his weathered face unreadable. He had been watching, then. Wei did not know for how long.

"Not ghosts," Wei said. "People I saved."

"Were they saved?" Huang walked into the temple, his footsteps slow on the stone floor. "Or just delayed?"

"What's the difference?"

"None, maybe." Huang sat on one of the benches, grunting as his knees bent. "We're all dying on installment here. You choose who pays first, that's all. But you're acting like there's something more. Like you can change the total."

Wei said nothing. The list in his tunic felt heavy, accusatory.

"How many have you tracked?" Huang asked.

"Fifteen. Twelve are dead."

Huang was silent for a moment. Then: "You think you're cursed?"

The word hung in the air between them. Wei had not spoken it aloud, had barely allowed himself to think it, but now that Huang had named it, the thought coiled tight in his chest.

"I think the numbers are wrong," Wei said carefully.

"The numbers are always wrong." Huang leaned back against the wall. "You know how many patients I've had in twelve years? Hundreds. Thousands, maybe. How many are still alive? I don't know. I don't count. Because the counting doesn't change the work. You clean the wound. You set the bone. They live or they don't. Tracking them afterward is just torturing yourself."

"But if there's a pattern—"

"There's always a pattern if you look hard enough." Huang's voice was gentle but firm. "Confirmation bias, my teacher called it. You notice the deaths because you're looking for them. You forget the survivors because they don't fit the story you're telling yourself."

Wei wanted to argue, but the logic was sound. He had no systematic data. He had not tracked every patient equally. The fifteen were a selected sample, chosen because he remembered them clearly, which meant they were likely outliers to begin with. The methodology was flawed.

But the feeling remained: something was wrong. Something beyond normal attrition. Something targeting the people he saved.

"Maybe," Wei said finally. "Maybe you're right."

Huang studied him for a long moment, then stood. "Burn the list, Shufen. It's not helping you. And the wounded need you clear-headed."

He left. Wei sat alone in the temple, the list still tucked against his chest, and wondered if Old Huang was right or if he had simply learned not to ask questions that had no good answers.

---

Wei heard the whispers three days later.

He was in the West Ward, checking on a family he had treated for dysentery the previous week. The mother had recovered; the two children were still weak but improving. Wei left them with instructions to boil their drinking water and walked back toward the temple through the narrow streets.

Two soldiers stood near a well, filling leather bags. Wei recognized them from the wall garrison but did not know their names. He would have passed without speaking, but one of them saw him coming and went silent mid-sentence. The other turned, saw Wei, and his expression tightened.

Wei nodded in greeting and kept walking. But he heard the resumed conversation behind him, low and urgent:

"—told you. Don't let the lüshuai treat you."

"That's superstition."

"Is it? Liu, Chen, the whole second squad—dead within a month of leaving his temple."

"Coincidence. War kills people."

"Not like this. Everyone he touches dies. My cousin, the one with the broken arm? Healed perfect, walked out smiling. Dead two weeks later. Cannonball took him in the chest."

"You're saying Wei cursed him?"

A pause. Then: "I'm saying I'd rather die of my wound than risk his temple."

Wei kept walking. His pace did not change. His expression did not shift. But inside, something cold and sharp settled in his gut.

He had heard whispers before—soldiers were superstitious, always looking for omens and curses—but this was different. This was specific. This was his name attached to a pattern he had seen himself but dismissed as impossible.

*Everyone he touches dies.*

By evening, Wei had heard variations of it three more times. A civilian woman who turned away when he offered to check her child's cough. A soldier who asked for Old Huang instead when Wei approached his bedside. Another conversation, half-heard in a food distribution line: *"The long-haired lüshuai is cursed. Best to avoid him."*

The reputation was spreading. And with it, a horrifying implication: if people believed he was cursed, they would avoid treatment. And avoiding treatment would kill them just as surely as any curse.

Wei returned to the temple and tried to focus on work. But the whispers followed him, and the list in his tunic felt like a stone.

---

She came to him at dusk.

Wei was washing tools in a bucket of boiled water when he saw her standing in the temple entrance. The girl from the market—the one whose family he had sent to the village, the one who had watched her parents burn. She was thinner now, skeletal, her arms like sticks and her belly distended with the wrong kind of fullness. Starvation. The siege had tightened in the past six months. Food rations had been cut again and again. The girl had been surviving on scraps.

Wei dried his hands and stood. "You're hungry."

She nodded. She did not speak. Her eyes were huge in her shrunken face.

Wei went to his personal supply—a small bag of rice he had saved from his own rations—and scooped a handful into a bowl. He added water from the bucket, stirred it into a thin gruel, and handed it to her.

She ate without looking at him. Fast, hunched over the bowl, her hands trembling. Like an animal certain the food would be taken away. When the bowl was empty, she finally met his eyes.

"You sent us away," she said. "Everyone died."

It was not an accusation. Just a fact. A statement of cause and effect.

"I know," Wei said.

"They said it was bad luck. That the demons found the village by chance. But everyone died. The whole village. Just like..." She stopped, swallowed. "Just like everyone you save dies."

Wei's chest tightened. "Who told you that?"

"Everyone. People say if you touch them, they die later. That you're cursed. That the Heavenly Father has turned His face from you."

Wei knelt so he was at her level. He checked her pulse—weak, thready—and examined her eyes and gums. Severe malnutrition. Likely parasites. She would die within a month if she did not get consistent food.

"I'm not cursed," Wei said, though he was no longer sure he believed it.

The girl said nothing. She had stopped listening. She was looking past him at the empty Buddha alcove, her expression blank.

Wei gave her another half-bowl of rice gruel. Told her to come back every evening for more. Watched her leave, a skeletal wraith disappearing into the dusk.

Then he sat alone in the temple and pulled out the list.

He stared at the fifteen names. Twelve dead. Three survived or vanished. He thought of the girl's parents, who he had not written down but who belonged on the list anyway. Thought of the whispers: *Everyone he touches dies.*

The pattern was real. He could feel it now, could see the shape of it even if he could not understand the mechanism. Something was wrong. Something beyond war's normal chaos. Something targeting his patients specifically.

Wei took the list outside and burned it.

He watched the charcoal names smudge and curl as the paper caught fire. Watched the smoke rise into the evening air, carrying the evidence away. The list was gone, but the pattern remained. The knowledge remained. And the count—the terrible, inexorable count—remained most of all.

*One hundred thirty-three saved. One hundred twenty-eight lost.*

Five. He had five left before the ledger inverted, before he had killed more than he had saved. Five lives separating him from a truth he could not accept.

Wei let the paper burn to ash. Ground the ash under his heel. Went back inside to prepare for tomorrow's wounded.

Behind him, the city settled into its nightly rhythm: guards on the walls, families in their quarters, the siege grinding forward one day at a time. Somewhere in the darkness, the girl walked alone through empty streets, carrying the half-bowl of rice like a fragile treasure. And in the temple, Wei knelt before the empty alcove and tried once more to pray.

No words came. Only numbers.

*One hundred thirty-three saved. One hundred twenty-eight lost.*

The pattern was visible now. The whispers were spreading. And Wei had no explanation except the one he refused to speak aloud:

Perhaps they were right. Perhaps he was cursed.

And if he was cursed, what did that mean for everyone still breathing who had passed through his hands?

The question had no answer. Wei rose, extinguished the lamp, and lay down on his mat in the darkness. Tomorrow would bring more wounded. The count would continue. And the gap—that terrible, narrowing gap—would close further still.

He did not sleep that night. He only counted.

# Scene 5: The Manna

The bowl sat in Wei's hands, and inside it was the end of faith.

Weeds. That was the truth of it, stripped of theology and proclamation. Grass clippings from the palace gardens, roots that might have been edible in spring but had been dug up in desperation, leaves from plants Wei did not recognize and would not feed to livestock. All of it wilted, browning, mixed with water into a green-tinged slurry that smelled of rot and earth.

The decree had arrived three days ago, carried by runners through the city with the urgent formality of divine revelation:

*"The Heavenly Father provides manna, as He did for the Israelites in the wilderness. Eat the sweet dew from the palace gardens, which is the food of heaven. God will sustain the faithful. Trust in His provision."*

Sweet dew. Manna. The food of heaven.

Wei stared at the bowl and saw weeds.

Around him, in the temple courtyard, civilians choked it down. They had no choice. The rice rations had been cut to nearly nothing—a handful per family per week, supplemented now with this. Some added water to make it easier to swallow. Others ate it dry, gagging on the fibrous mass. Children cried and refused until their parents forced it into their mouths. The elderly ate in silence, their faces expressionless, beyond complaint.

Wei had not eaten yet. He held the bowl and tried to reconcile the decree with the evidence.

*This is not God's provision,* he thought. *This is a man lying to himself while his people starve.*

The thought was sharp, clean, final. Not doubt—dismissal. Wei had questioned doctrine before, had felt the gap between promise and reality widen over the months. But this was different. This was the moment the gap became unbridgeable, the moment when continuing to believe required a willful blindness Wei could no longer summon.

Hong Xiuquan was not speaking for God. He was speaking from madness or desperation or both, and calling it divine will.

Wei lifted the bowl to his lips and forced himself to taste it.

Bitter. Earthy. Wrong in a way that had nothing to do with flavor and everything to do with the body's instinctive rejection of what should not be consumed. He swallowed anyway, felt the slimy mass slide down his throat, and set the bowl aside.

The manna would not sustain them. It would sicken them. And some of them would die.

He stood and walked toward the Holy Treasury distribution point.

---

The line stretched for blocks.

Wei stood to the side and watched as the treasury official—a thin man in a yellow sash, his face gaunt with the same starvation he was supposed to prevent—distributed the day's rations. Rice for a few. Manna for most. The arithmetic was brutal and visible.

Twenty-five families under Wei's care. He was responsible for their food distribution as Sim a, the lowest rung of the administrative ladder. He had arrived early to collect the allotment: two small bags of rice, one large basket of manna.

The rice would feed perhaps five families adequately. The rest would get weeds.

Wei made the choice the same way he made every choice now: with clinical precision and no illusions.

The children got rice. The elderly got manna. The adults got whatever remained, divided by need and likelihood of survival. A woman nursing an infant: rice. A man already sick with dysentery: manna, because rice would not save him anyway. A family of four, all healthy: half rice, half manna, stretching both as far as they would go.

The families accepted their portions without protest. They had learned not to argue with scarcity. Wei handed out the rations with his face carefully neutral, but inside he felt the weight of every decision, every life calibrated against insufficient resources.

A child looked into her bowl of manna and started crying. Her mother shushed her quickly, too tired for gentleness. The child swallowed her tears and ate.

Wei watched and thought: *This is what the Heavenly Kingdom has become. Children eating weeds while we call it providence.*

By evening, fifty-three people in Wei's ward had developed dysentery.

---

The outbreak started fast and spread faster.

Wei had expected it—contaminated water, nutritionally void food, bodies already weakened by months of deprivation—but the scale still shocked him. By the second day, half the ward was sick. By the third, he had run out of clean cloth for bandages and was using ash to pack wounds because he had nothing else.

The temple floor became a field hospital for a different kind of casualty. Not combat wounds but the slower violence of starvation and disease. People lay in rows, too weak to move, their bowels emptying in liquid streams that stank of rot and blood. Wei and Old Huang and young Ping worked without rest, boiling water, cleaning bodies, trying to keep patients hydrated while their intestines tore themselves apart.

They had no medicine. The Holy Treasury had nothing left. Wei boiled rags and used them to cool foreheads. He made patients drink water until they vomited, then made them drink more. He held them while they convulsed and whispered reassurances he did not believe.

And they died anyway.

An old man. A young mother. A child who had been eating manna for less than a week. The causes were identical: dehydration, electrolyte collapse, organ failure. The bodies piled up faster than Wei could burn them.

On the fourth day, Elder Zhou called Wei to his mat.

Zhou was one of the original believers, a man who had joined the Taiping in the earliest days and had never wavered. Wei had treated him for a minor wound months ago—a cut that had healed cleanly, counted in the ledger as saved. Now Zhou lay dying of dysentery, his body a skeleton draped in loose skin, his breathing shallow and wet.

"Lüshuai," Zhou whispered. "Why does the Heavenly Father allow this?"

Wei knelt beside him. He had no answer that would comfort. No theological explanation that made sense of children dying from eating what their king called manna.

"I don't know," Wei said.

"Perhaps..." Zhou's voice was barely audible. "Perhaps we have sinned. Perhaps the manna is our test. To see if we trust Him even in suffering."

Wei looked at the old man's face—gaunt, faithful, dying because he had trusted a proclamation that called weeds food—and felt something break inside him.

"This is not a test," Wei said quietly. "This is not God."

Zhou's eyes widened. "Lüshuai—"

"This is a man lying to himself while his people starve. The manna is not heaven's provision. It's grass. It's killing you. And calling it divine will not change that."

Silence. Zhou stared at him, too weak to argue, too faithful to accept.

Wei stood. "I'm sorry. I should not have—"

"No." Zhou's hand gripped Wei's wrist with surprising strength. "You spoke truth. I... I needed to hear it."

He died that night. Wei added him to the count and did not pray.

---

By the end of the first week, Wei had stopped tracking the ledger.

The numbers had become meaningless. He did not know who counted as saved anymore—those who survived the manna only to face next week's starvation? Those he kept alive through dysentery so they could die of something else? The categories of saved and lost had collapsed into a single truth: everyone was dying. Wei was only choosing the speed.

He sat in the temple at midnight, the floor finally empty of living patients, and looked at his hands. They were shaking. Not from exhaustion, though he had not slept in four days. From the knowledge that everything he had counted, everything he had tracked and measured and used to justify his work, was a fiction.

The ledger was a lie. The manna was a lie. The Heavenly Kingdom's promise of protection and provision was a lie.

But the work remained.

Wei could have fled. Officers had been deserting for months, slipping through the siege lines to surrender to the Qing or disappearing into the countryside. The city was a tomb. Staying was choosing to die slowly alongside everyone else.

He stayed anyway.

Not because of God. Not because of doctrine. Not because he believed the Heavenly Father would reward his faithfulness or protect his patients. He stayed because the people in his ward needed someone who knew how to boil water and clean wounds and tell them honestly when death was coming.

Function without faith. Duty without hope. The work stripped of everything except the work itself.

Wei stood and walked through the temple. Tomorrow there would be more dysentery. More deaths. More bodies to burn. The manna would keep coming because there was nothing else. The Heavenly King would keep calling it providence because admitting otherwise would shatter what remained of his authority.

And Wei would keep working because stopping would not save anyone.

Outside, the city was silent except for the occasional cough or cry. The siege had progressed beyond desperation into something like resignation. People moved slowly, conserving energy. Speech was minimal. The nightly hymns had stopped weeks ago—no one had the strength to sing.

Wei returned to his mat and lay down. He did not pray. Did not count. Did not think about saved or lost or the ledger that had once given his work meaning.

He thought instead about the girl who came every evening for rice. About Old Huang, still working despite his own hunger. About the child who cried when given manna and ate it anyway because her mother told her to.

These were the truths that remained when theology collapsed. Not salvation. Not divine protection. Just the immediate, fragile fact of bodies that still breathed and might breathe tomorrow if someone helped them.

*We can't save them all, Shufen. Only try.*

His mother's voice had been right all along. Not because trying led to saving. But because trying was what you did when there was nothing else.

Wei closed his eyes. His hands still shook. In the darkness, he could hear someone vomiting in the courtyard—another patient succumbing to the manna's poison. He should get up. Should check on them. Should boil more water.

He would. In a moment. First he needed to rest. Just for a moment.

But sleep would not come. Only the knowledge that tomorrow would be the same as today, and the day after that, and the day after that, until either the siege ended or everyone inside the walls was dead.

Wei lay in the dark and accepted it.

The ledger was closed. The doctrine was ash. And what remained was only the question: If not salvation, then what?

The answer, Wei thought, was simpler than he had believed. Not salvation. Just presence. Just hands that kept working when belief had nothing left to offer.

It was not enough to change anything. But it was what he had.

And so he would give it.

# Scene 6: The King is Dead

On the first day of the sixth month, the Heavenly King ascended. Or so they said.

The runners came at dawn, breathless, their faces carefully composed in expressions of reverent grief. Wei heard them in the courtyard before he saw them, their voices carrying the formal cadence of official proclamation:

*"The Heavenly King Hong Xiuquan has ascended to sit at the right hand of the Heavenly Father. He has left his earthly body to reign in paradise. Let all the faithful rejoice, for he dwells now in eternal glory."*

Wei stood at the temple entrance, his hands still wet from washing the night's bandages. He listened to the words and felt nothing.

Around him, the city reacted in fragments. Some wept—true believers who had followed Hong from Guangxi, who still thought the Kingdom was God's will manifest. Some rioted—men who had watched their families starve while Hong issued decrees about manna and divine protection. Most were silent, too tired or hungry to spare energy for grief or rage.

Wei dried his hands on a rag and went back inside.

Old Huang was already treating the morning's wounded—three men with minor injuries, a woman with an infected leg. He looked up when Wei entered, his weathered face unreadable.

"You heard?"

"I heard."

"What do you think?"

Wei knelt beside a soldier whose shoulder wound had reopened during night watch. He examined the stitching—clean, holding—and rewrapped the bandage. His hands moved through familiar motions while his mind circled a single thought.

"I think he ate manna like the rest of us," Wei said quietly. "And I think it killed him."

Huang said nothing. There was nothing to say. They both knew the whispers: Hong had gone mad in his final weeks, raving about angels and demons, refusing all food except the sweet dew he claimed sustained him. The official story—ascension to heaven—was theater. The reality was a man dying of starvation and delusion in a palace while his kingdom collapsed around him.

Wei finished with the soldier and moved to the next patient. The woman with the infected leg. He unwrapped the bandage and saw the flesh hot and red, the smell wrong. Gangrene. She had perhaps a week.

He cleaned the wound anyway. Applied what little salve remained. Told her to keep it dry and come back in three days.

She would not live three days. Wei knew this. Did it anyway.

The Heavenly King was dead. The theological keystone was gone. And the structure, Wei thought, had already been hollow for years.

---

By midday, the city had fractured into chaos.

The riot started at the Holy Treasury. A crowd of civilians—skeletal, moving with the jerky urgency of starvation—had stormed the gates demanding food. The treasury was empty. It had been empty for months. But hunger does not accept inventory reports. The crowd surged forward, was met by guards, and the confrontation dissolved into violence.

Wei heard the commotion from the temple—shouts, the crack of wood breaking, a scream that cut off abruptly—but he did not go to investigate. The riot was not his concern. His concern was the temple floor, where three new wounded had arrived.

A man trampled in the crush. Broken ribs, possibly internal bleeding. Wei packed the ribs with bandages and told him to breathe shallowly.

A woman stabbed in the shoulder during a fight over a sack of grain. The grain sack was empty. She had been stabbed over nothing. Wei cleaned the wound, stitched it closed, tried not to think about the futility.

A boy, perhaps twelve, with his arm opened by shrapnel from... something. Wei did not ask. He extracted the metal, packed the wound, bandaged it tight.

The work continued. The city was collapsing, and Wei knelt in the temple applying poultices and counting nothing.

Old Huang worked beside him without speaking. Young Ping had disappeared—fled, perhaps, or caught in the riot. It did not matter. The wounded kept coming.

By sunset, the riot had burned itself out. The Holy Treasury stood looted and empty, which was the same as it had been before, except now the gates were broken and two people were dead. Wei treated the survivors and watched the smoke rise from fires set in the chaos.

The Heavenly King was dead. The Kingdom was dying. And Wei felt the weight of it settle on him like stones piled on his chest.

---

That night, Wei sat in the empty temple and did not move.

He had sent the last wounded away—told them to rest, to come back if the wounds worsened, knowing most would not come back because most would be dead. Old Huang had left to check on his own family. The temple was silent except for the distant sound of weeping somewhere in the city, too far to identify, too constant to ignore.

Wei sat in the empty Buddha alcove where the goddess of mercy had once resided and stared at nothing.

The thought that had been growing for months—hidden, denied, circling like a vulture—finally landed:

*Everyone I help dies.*

Twelve from fifteen. The girl's parents. Chen and the second squad. Elder Zhou. The raid victims. The dysentery cases. On and on. Every person he had saved, every wound he had cleaned and bandaged and counted as victory, had died anyway. Not eventually—quickly. Within weeks or months. Targeted, as if his touch marked them for death.

The pattern was impossible. The pattern was undeniable.

Wei had tried to dismiss it. Confirmation bias. War's ordinary chaos. Bad luck compounded by siege conditions. But the arithmetic would not lie: the ratio had inverted. More lost than saved. The ledger he had kept for twelve years had closed against him.

And now Hong was dead. The Kingdom was dead. And Wei sat in an empty temple and thought: *I am the common factor.*

The conclusion was inescapable. The curse was real.

And if the curse was real, then the only mercy he could offer was to stop.

Wei stood. Walked to his medical bag. Looked at the instruments inside—needles, thread, grinding stone, the last pouches of herbs. His hands, which had touched thousands of wounds, which had saved forty-eight and lost one hundred thirty-three, hung useless at his sides.

He closed the bag. Set it aside. Went back to the alcove and sat down.

Tomorrow, wounded would come. He would tell them to see Old Huang. Or the other medics in the East Ward. Or no one. It did not matter. What mattered was that Wei would not touch them. Would not mark them for death.

He sat in the darkness and waited for the decision to feel like relief.

It felt like drowning.

---

The child came on the third day.

Wei had been sitting for fifty hours. He had not eaten except for half a bowl of manna that Old Huang had forced into his hands. He had not slept. Three wounded had come to the temple in that time. Wei had sent them away. Told them he could not help. Watched them leave, confused and bleeding, and felt nothing.

Old Huang had argued. Had demanded explanations. Wei had given none. Huang had finally left in disgust, muttering about shame and duty. Wei had remained in the alcove, staring at the stone floor, waiting for the curse to lift now that he had stopped feeding it.

The child entered at dawn.

Wei heard him before he saw him—small footsteps, uneven, dragging slightly. Then breathing, shallow and quick. Then silence.

Wei looked up.

The boy stood in the doorway, silhouetted against the pale morning light. Perhaps seven years old. Barefoot, filthy, his tunic torn and stained dark with blood. His left arm hung at his side, bleeding from a deep gash across the forearm. Shrapnel, probably. Or glass from a broken window. The wound was fresh—still flowing, not yet clotted.

The boy stared at Wei. Wei stared back.

Neither spoke.

The moment stretched. The boy swayed slightly, blood dripping to the stone floor in slow, rhythmic drops. Wei sat motionless in the alcove, his medical bag three paces away, his hands empty.

*If I help him,* Wei thought, *he will die.*

The pattern was certain. The curse was proven. Every person Wei touched was marked. The boy was bleeding now, but that wound was survivable. What would kill him was Wei's intervention—the invisible machinery of death that followed Wei's patients like a shadow.

*Let him go,* Wei thought. *Let him find someone else. Anyone else.*

The boy took a step forward. His face was pale, shock-smoothed, but his eyes were fixed on Wei with an animal certainty: *You are the medic. You help.*

Wei looked at the wound. Saw the blood. Saw the depth of the cut—not arterial, but deep enough to need stitching. Saw the boy's shallow breathing, the beginning of shock.

*If I help him, he will die. The walls will break. The city will fall. He will die in the massacre or the famine or the disease. Helping him now only delays it.*

The thought was clean, logical, irrefutable.

And underneath it, quieter, something else:

*But he's bleeding now.*

Wei stood.

His legs were stiff from sitting. He walked to his medical bag, knelt, opened it. The instruments were still there, waiting. Needle and thread. Clean cloth. A small jar of honey-garlic paste.

The boy watched, silent.

Wei gestured to the floor. "Sit."

The boy sat.

Wei knelt beside him and examined the wound. Deep. Ragged edges. Would scar badly even with stitching. He cleaned it with boiled water from the bucket Old Huang had left, working quickly, his hands moving through motions so familiar they required no thought.

The boy gasped but did not cry. Wei packed the wound with paste, threaded the needle, began stitching.

*It doesn't matter if I'm cursed,* Wei thought. *He needs help.*

The realization was not dramatic. Not a revelation. Just a fact, simple and irreducible: the wound was real. The bleeding was immediate. The boy needed stitches, and Wei knew how to give them.

What happened after—whether the boy lived or died, whether the curse followed or the walls fell or the Kingdom collapsed—was not in Wei's control. Had never been in his control. The ledger had been a fiction from the beginning, a story he told himself to make the work bearable.

But the work itself was not fiction. The wound was real. The stitching was real. The boy's breathing, shallow and quick, was real.

Wei tied off the last stitch and bandaged the arm.

"Keep it clean," he said. "Come back in three days if it smells sweet or the skin goes hot."

The boy nodded. Stood. Looked at Wei with something that might have been gratitude or might have been simple exhaustion.

He left without speaking.

Wei watched him go. Watched him walk through the temple gate into the morning light, one arm cradled against his chest, his bare feet silent on the stone.

*When the walls break,* Wei thought, *he'll die anyway. But not from this wound. Not today.*

He turned back to the temple. The floor needed washing—blood had pooled where the boy had sat. His tools needed cleaning. There would be more wounded. There were always more.

Wei picked up his bag and went back to work.

Outside, the siege continued. The Qing guns fired. The walls held. And in the empty palace, the Heavenly King's body was being prepared for burial in a coffin lined with yellow silk, his ascension to heaven already fading into rumor and myth.

Wei did not pray for him. Did not count him as saved or lost. Did not add him to any ledger.

He only cleaned his tools and waited for the next wounded to arrive.

The curse, if it had ever been real, no longer mattered. The boy's wound had been real. Wei had stitched it. That was enough.

It was all there had ever been.

# Scene 7: The Walls Break

Forty-six days later, the walls broke at dawn.

Wei woke to the sound—not the familiar percussion of artillery, but something deeper. A bass note that traveled through stone and earth, a pressure wave that made his chest cavity resonate. Then the roar. Then the screaming.

He knew immediately: this was the end.

Wei sat up in the empty temple where he had slept since Old Huang had died three weeks prior. His medical bag sat beside him, its leather strap worn smooth by twelve years of carrying. He reached for it without thinking—automatic, the way a soldier reaches for a weapon—and moved toward the door.

Outside, the sky was wrong. Where the West Wall should have been, there was dust. A massive cloud rising, backlit by the dawn, blotting out the horizon. Through the haze Wei could see the breach: a gap perhaps forty paces wide where stone and earth had simply ceased to exist.

Gunfire crackled from the gap. Screaming followed—high, constant, overlapping. The Xiang Army was flooding through.

Wei had minutes, not hours.

He turned back to the temple.

Forty wounded lay on the floor where he had placed them over the past weeks. Most could not walk. Some could not sit. Two were unconscious, fever-bright and delirious. Around them huddled perhaps two hundred civilians—families who had sought shelter in the temple when the shelling intensified, children pressed against their mothers, old men staring at nothing.

Fifteen soldiers stood guard at the perimeter. Young men, mostly. Exhausted. Armed with spears and matchlocks that might fire once before jamming.

Wei looked at them all and did the arithmetic.

Forty wounded: cannot evacuate. Will die here.

Two hundred civilians: perhaps half mobile enough to run. The rest too weak, too young, too old.

Fifteen soldiers: could fight through the chaos or escort civilians. Not both.

Escape routes: West Gate, possibly open but likely surrounded. Or the river—which meant drowning or being shot in the water.

The math was clean. Most would die. Organizing an evacuation might save twenty, maybe thirty. The rest were already dead; they just didn't know it yet.

Wei closed his eyes. Breathed. Opened them.

"Captain Zhou," he called to the oldest soldier. The man looked up—fifty, scarred, holding a spear like it was part of his arm. "We're evacuating."

Zhou stared at him. "Lüshuai, the wounded—"

"Cannot move," Wei finished. "I know. But the mobile civilians can. Take your men. Lead them to the West Gate. Fight through if you can. Run if you can't."

Zhou looked at the civilians. Looked at the wounded. Looked back at Wei.

"Come with us," Zhou said quietly.

Wei shook his head. "My place is here."

He gestured to the forty wounded on the floor. Some were watching this exchange, their eyes tracking between Wei and the soldiers. Others stared at the ceiling, already past fear into something hollow.

"They're dead anyway," Zhou said. Not cruel. Just true.

"Yes," Wei agreed. "But I'm not leaving them."

Zhou held his gaze for a long moment. Then nodded. He turned to the other soldiers, began barking orders. "Mobile civilians to the center! Children first! Anyone who can walk, move now!"

The temple erupted into motion. Mothers grabbed children. Old men helped old women to their feet. The soldiers formed a loose perimeter around the group—perhaps ninety people in total, Wei counted. More than he'd hoped. Fewer than he'd wanted.

Wei moved among them, pointing, directing. "Stay together. Don't run ahead. If the gate is blocked, try the river. Don't stop for the wounded in the street."

A young woman—girl, really, perhaps sixteen—clutched his arm. "Lüshuai, what about you?"

"I'll follow," Wei lied.

She didn't believe him. He saw it in her eyes. But she let go anyway, turned, joined the group.

Captain Zhou assembled them at the temple entrance. Looked back at Wei one last time.

Wei nodded.

Zhou led them out into the smoke and chaos.

---

Wei followed at a distance.

Not to escape. He had no intention of leaving the temple's wounded unattended at the end. But he could at least see them to the gate. Could at least witness what happened.

The streets were apocalyptic. Smoke hung thick, turning the morning light orange and sick. Bodies lay in the gutters—civilians cut down while fleeing, soldiers killed at their posts. The gunfire was constant now, echoing from the West Wall where Qing forces were pouring into the city.

Wei walked behind the group, watching. They moved quickly, staying together as he'd instructed. Captain Zhou led from the front, his spear raised, shouting orders Wei couldn't hear over the chaos.

They passed a burning building. A child crying over a body. A group of soldiers running the opposite direction, their faces blank with terror.

Wei saw a woman in the crowd ahead—her profile, the way she carried herself—and something tightened in his chest.

*Mei?*

His sister. Or someone who looked like his sister. He hadn't seen her in thirteen years—not since the Taiping segregation laws separated men and women into different districts. She would be older now. Different. But the shape of her was familiar, or he thought it was, or he wanted it to be.

"Mei!" he called.

She didn't turn. Too far ahead, or the name was wrong, or she had forgotten him.

The group reached the West Gate plaza. Wei stopped at the edge, fifty paces back, watching from the shadow of a collapsed wall.

The gate was open. Beyond it: fields, smoke, the distant river. Escape was possible. Zhou was leading them through—

And then the cavalry appeared.

Qing horsemen, perhaps thirty strong, emerging from the smoke like they had been waiting. Like they had known exactly when and where the refugees would appear.

Wei watched as the formation wheeled into position. Watched as the order was given. Watched as the lances dropped and the horses charged.

The civilians scattered. Screamed. Ran in every direction.

It made no difference.

The cavalry cut through them like scissors through silk. Methodical. Efficient. Wei saw Captain Zhou go down with a lance through his chest. Saw the young woman who had clutched his arm trampled beneath hooves. Saw the woman who might have been his sister—or wasn't, he would never know—cut down from behind, her body crumpling into the mud.

In less than a minute, it was over.

Wei stood at the edge of the plaza and watched the bodies settle. Ninety people. Now zero. The evacuation he had organized, the people he had sent to safety, all dead.

He had saved no one.

The cavalry wheeled again, searching for more targets. Wei stepped back into the shadow before they saw him. Turned. Walked back the way he had come.

The temple was two streets away. The wounded were still there, waiting. He had promised he would not leave them.

Wei walked through the smoke and the screaming and the bodies and felt nothing.

The trying had mattered. The outcome had not.

---

Inside the temple, the forty wounded waited in silence.

They had heard the evacuation. Heard the group leave. Heard the screaming from the plaza, distant but unmistakable. Now they lay on the stone floor and listened to the gunfire getting closer.

Wei entered. Closed the door behind him. It would not hold—the Qing would break through in minutes—but it gave the illusion of shelter.

He knelt beside the nearest wounded man. Checked his pulse. Still strong. Still alive for now.

"Lüshuai," a voice said. Wei looked up. The boy—seventeen, maybe younger, wounded in the leg during the riot weeks ago. His face was pale, his breathing shallow. "Will it hurt?"

Wei looked at him. Thought about Jean, about honesty. Thought about compassion. Chose both.

"No," he lied gently. "It will be quick."

The boy's face relaxed slightly. Not reassured, but comforted by the kindness.

Wei moved among the wounded, checking each one. Some were unconscious. Some watched him with wide, terrified eyes. Some prayed—quiet Taiping prayers, invoking the Heavenly Father and the Heavenly King, theology that had already collapsed but still offered the comfort of familiar words.

Wei did not pray.

He knelt beside the boy again and took his hand. The boy's fingers were cold, trembling. Wei held them steady.

Outside, the screaming was getting closer. Boots on stone. Orders shouted in the Xiang Army dialect. The Qing was clearing the streets, building by building.

Wei stayed.

Not because God commanded it. Not because the Kingdom required it. Not because he believed it would save anyone.

He stayed because the boy's hand was cold, and holding it was warm. Because the wounded were terrified, and presence mattered. Because this was what he did.

Outcome-independent. Purified.

The footsteps reached the temple door. Wei heard voices outside—soldiers confirming the building, reporting back to their commander. The door rattled. Held for a moment.

Then splintered.

The boy's hand tightened in his. Wei squeezed back.

"It's all right," Wei whispered.

The door broke open. Sunlight flooded in, dusty and red with smoke. Silhouettes filled the doorway—soldiers, armed with spears and dao swords.

Wei looked up at them. Held the boy's hand.

And waited.

# Scene 8: The Ledger Closes

The soldiers stood in the doorway, backlit by smoke and morning light.

Wei knelt on the temple floor, the boy's hand in his, and looked up at them.

For a long moment, no one moved.

The soldiers were young—younger than Wei expected. Xiang Army regulars, not the elite units. Their uniforms were mud-stained, their faces exhausted. They had been fighting for weeks, tunneling under the wall, waiting for the explosion. Now they were here, in a temple full of wounded and one officer in a torn red tunic who was clearly not a threat.

The lead soldier—a sergeant, Wei guessed from the insignia—looked at the scene. Forty wounded men on the floor. One medic kneeling among them. No weapons visible. No resistance.

"Sir," the sergeant said, his voice carefully neutral.

Wei said nothing. Held the boy's hand.

The sergeant looked back toward the street, where an officer was directing other units. Called out: "Temple is clear. Wounded and a medic."

The officer's response carried through the door: "No quarter. Kill them all."

The sergeant's face did not change. He had expected this. Had probably given the same order himself in other buildings.

He looked at Wei. Wei looked back.

"Stand aside," the sergeant said.

Wei did not move.

The boy's hand tightened in his. Trembling. Wei squeezed back, gentle.

Around them, the forty wounded waited. Some had closed their eyes. Some stared at the ceiling. Some watched the soldiers with the blank, hollow gaze of men who had already left their bodies.

One old man—Elder Fang, a believer from the early days—whispered a prayer: "Heavenly Father, receive us into your kingdom. Heavenly King, we come to serve you in paradise..."

Wei did not pray.

He thought instead of his mother.

Guangxi, 1839. Her hands showing him how to grind herbs into paste, how to boil roots for tea, how to read the color of a wound. Her voice, patient and clear: *"We can't save them all, Shufen. Only try."*

He thought of his sister, Mei. Her laugh, bright and quick, before the segregation laws took her away. He wondered if she had survived. Wondered if the woman in the plaza had been her. Would never know.

He thought of his first patient. A farmer, 1851, spear wound to the shoulder. Wei had been twenty-four, newly trained, terrified he would make it worse. The man had lived. Had thanked Wei, gripping his hand the way the boy's hand gripped his now.

He thought of the thousands who came after. The ledger he had kept for twelve years, the names and numbers and ratios. Forty-eight saved, twenty-three lost. Then seventy-one and fifty-eight. Then one hundred thirty-three and one hundred twenty-eight.

The gap closing. Inverting. Meaningless.

And then abandoned.

Because the ledger had never been the point.

The trying was the point.

The sergeant stepped forward, his dao sword drawn.

Wei looked at him and felt a question rise—not his own question, but something older, something that echoed from a life he did not remember:

*What deserves conviction?*

He did not know where the question came from. Did not recognize the voice. But the answer rose immediately, clear and certain:

*This. Them. Now.*

Not God. Not the Kingdom. Not success or victory or the hope that his work would matter in any measurable way.

Just the act itself.

The wounded boy whose hand he held. The forty men on the floor who were about to die. The presence he could offer in their last moments.

That deserved conviction.

Not because it would save them. Not because it would change anything. Not because anyone would remember or care.

Because the trying was never nothing.

Wei held the boy's hand and waited.

The sergeant raised his sword—

And paused.

For just a moment, Wei saw something cross the man's face. Recognition, maybe. Or respect. The acknowledgment that the man kneeling on the floor was not a soldier or an enemy, just a medic doing what medics do.

Then the moment passed.

The sergeant's expression hardened. Orders were orders. He gestured to the other soldiers. "Clear the temple."

The soldiers moved forward.

---

Wei stood.

Not to fight. Not to flee. Just to stand between the soldiers and the wounded for as long as he could.

His hands were empty. No weapon. No medical bag. Just his body, thin and exhausted, a barrier that would accomplish nothing.

The boy called out: "Lüshuai—"

"It's all right," Wei said.

The sergeant stepped forward. Raised his spear.

Wei raised his hands. Not surrender. Not supplication. Just: *I am not a threat.*

The gesture bought him ten seconds.

That was all.

The sergeant's face was professionally blank. He had done this before. Would do it again. In a siege city where quarter was not given, mercy was a luxury neither side could afford.

"I'm sorry," the sergeant said.

Wei believed him.

The spear punched through Wei's chest.

Fast. Clean. The sergeant had been trained well. The blade entered just below the sternum, angled upward, found the heart. Wei felt the pressure—a terrible, invasive wrongness—and then the pain.

Sharp. Bright. Consuming.

He fell backward. The spear withdrew. Wei landed on the stone floor, his head striking the ground hard enough to blur his vision.

Above him, the temple ceiling. Wooden beams, smoke-stained and ancient. Dusty sunlight filtering through the gaps where artillery had damaged the roof.

The screaming started.

The soldiers moved through the temple methodically, killing the wounded where they lay. Wei heard it but could not turn his head to see. Could only stare at the ceiling and listen.

Spears striking flesh. Wet, final sounds. Men crying out, then falling silent.

The boy's voice: "No, please—"

Cut off.

Wei tried to breathe. His lungs would not fill. The air came wet, bubbling. He tasted copper. Blood in his mouth, in his throat.

His vision narrowed. Tunnel vision, darkening at the edges.

The smell of incense. Faint, underneath the blood and smoke. Old temple smell, lingering from before the goddess was smashed and the holy icons were destroyed. His mother's temple had smelled like this. Sandalwood and ash.

The stone was cold beneath his back. His blood was warm, spreading in a pool around him.

The screaming stopped. One by one, the voices cut off. Until the temple was silent except for the soldiers' boots on stone and Wei's own breathing—wet, failing, slowing.

He could not feel his legs. Could not feel his hands.

His vision darkened further. A tunnel of light, narrowing.

And in that tunnel, a thought. Clear and certain, untouched by pain or fear:

*I saved no one.*

*The walls fell. The kingdom fell. Every hand I held went cold.*

*But the holding was not nothing.*

*The trying is never nothing.*

*I will try again.*

The light narrowed to a point.

And went out.

---

Wei Shufen died on the stone floor of a temple that had once been consecrated to Guanyin, the goddess of mercy.

His body lay among forty others—soldiers, civilians, the wounded he had refused to abandon. Blood pooled around him, darkening the stone. His eyes were open, staring at the ceiling. One hand was still reaching toward where the boy had been, frozen mid-gesture.

Outside, the massacre continued. The Qing forces swept through Tianjing street by street, building by building. No quarter was given. No prisoners were taken. By nightfall, the city would be a graveyard.

But that was later.

For now, Wei's body lay in the dusty sunlight. The ledger he had kept for twelve years—forty-eight saved, twenty-three lost, then more, then less, then abandoned—was closed.

The numbers no longer mattered.

They had never mattered.

What mattered was the trying. The hands held. The wounds cleaned. The presence offered in the final moments.

Outcome-independent.

Purified.

The eighth perfection, achieved through futility.

The Xiang Army sergeant paused at the temple door on his way out. Looked back at the bodies. Saw the medic's body, his hand still reaching.

He did not pray. Did not speak. Just looked.

And moved on.

The war continued. The Kingdom of Heavenly Peace fell. History recorded the Taiping Rebellion as one of the deadliest conflicts in human history—twenty million dead, cities destroyed, dynasties shaken.

Wei Shufen was not recorded. His name appeared in no histories. The ledger he kept was lost in the fires. The patients he saved—and the ones he lost—were forgotten.

But the trying was not nothing.

And somewhere, in a pattern neither Wei nor the soldiers nor the historians would ever see, the seed of that trying took root.

*I will try again.*
