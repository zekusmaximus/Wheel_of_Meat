### Gaps Identified
- Scene 3: Taste sense minimal (acceptable - scene focuses on theological collapse)
- Scene 4: Taste indirect (girl eats, not Wei)

### Assessment
**PASS** - All scenes include all five senses. Gaps are minor and justified by scene focus. Sensory palette is period-appropriate (siege conditions: hunger, smoke, blood, bodies, dust).

---

## PASS 2: UNDERMINING CLAUSE AUDIT

### Methodology
Checked for complicating elements, adversative constructions, and paratactic contradictions appropriate to war epic genre.

### Sample Findings

**Effective undermining patterns:**
- "Four will live if I have supplies. Two might live. One will die." (arithmetic undermines hope)
- "Lucky. Chen would live." (brevity undermines significance)
- "The ledger balanced in Wei's favor: forty-eight saved, twenty-three lost." (numbers will invert - dramatic irony)
- "I sent them to safety and they died." (direct contradiction)
- "The Heavenly King was dead. The theological keystone was gone. And the structure, Wei thought, had already been hollow for years." (revelation of prior emptiness)
- "When the walls break, he'll die anyway. But not from this wound. Not today." (futility acknowledged, action justified)

### Method Verification
War epic genre employs:
- Pragmatic contradiction (action vs. outcome)
- Arithmetic undermining (numbers don't hold)
- Theological collapse (doctrine vs. body truth)
- Temporal undermining (will die anyway / but not now)

### Assessment
**PASS** - Undermining present throughout. Method matches war epic genre (expansion rather than clipped noir, aphoristic rather than paratactic). Every significant assertion complicated by second element.

## PASS 3: FORBIDDEN PATTERN SCAN

### Abstract Emotion Words

**Instances Found:** 3

1. **Scene 01, line ~40:** "the very desperate"
   - Context: Describing Lilith from outside POV ("someone watched from a place outside time, arranging coincidences with the patience of the very desperate")
   - Assessment: VIOLATION - Describes Lilith's internal state abstractly
   - **Action Required:** REVISE

2. **Scene 04, line ~180:** "Fast, desperate, like an animal"
   - Context: Girl eating rice ("She ate without looking at him. Fast, desperate, like an animal")
   - Assessment: BORDERLINE - Describes observable behavior, but "desperate" names the emotion
   - **Action Required:** REVISE for clarity

3. **Scene 06, line ~88:** "skeletal, desperate"
   - Context: Crowd at Holy Treasury ("A crowd of civilians—skeletal, desperate—had stormed the gates")
   - Assessment: VIOLATION - Abstract descriptor of crowd's emotional state
   - **Action Required:** REVISE

**Revisions Made:** See Pass 3 Revisions section below.

### Filter Verbs

**Instances Found:** Extensive use of saw, felt, knew, thought, wondered

**Assessment:** Most instances are PURPOSEFUL:
- "knew this with the certainty of experience" - establishes medical expertise
- "saw" used for medical observation and processing
- "felt" used for tactile sensation and physical manifestations
- "thought" used sparingly for Wei's internal arithmetic/reflection

**Justification:** War epic + clinical voice requires some filter verbs to convey:
- Medical observation and diagnosis
- Military calculation and triage
- Wei's ledger-keeping compulsion (numbers live in his mind)
- Distinction between what Wei knows vs. what he cannot know

Filter verb use is restrained, purposeful, and genre-appropriate.

### Buddhist Terminology

**Instances Found:** 1

- **Scene 05:** "Perhaps we have sinned. Perhaps the manna is our test. To see if we trust Him even in suffering."
  - Context: Elder Zhou's dialogue (Taiping Christian theology)
  - Assessment: ACCEPTABLE - Period-appropriate Christian usage, not Buddhist terminology

**All Other Buddhist Terms:** None found

### Other Violations

None identified.

### Assessment
**CONDITIONAL PASS** - Three abstract emotion words require revision. Filter verbs justified. No Buddhist terminology violations.

---

## PASS 3 REVISIONS

### Revision 1: Scene 01, line ~40
**Original:**
"Did not know that someone watched from a place outside time, arranging coincidences with the patience of the very desperate."

**Revised:**
"Did not know that someone watched from a place outside time, arranging coincidences with the patience of someone who had already lost everything and was now losing time itself."

**Rationale:** Removes "desperate" (abstract emotion) and replaces with concrete consequences (loss) and temporal pressure (specific to Lilith's tracking mission).

### Revision 2: Scene 04, line ~180
**Original:**
"She ate without looking at him. Fast, desperate, like an animal."

**Revised:**
"She ate without looking at him. Fast, hunched over the bowl, her hands trembling. Like an animal certain the food would be taken away."

**Rationale:** Replaces "desperate" with observable physical details (hunched, trembling) and simile that names the behavior, not the emotion.

### Revision 3: Scene 06, line ~88
**Original:**
"A crowd of civilians—skeletal, desperate—had stormed the gates demanding food."

**Revised:**
"A crowd of civilians—skeletal, moving with the jerky urgency of starvation—had stormed the gates demanding food."

**Rationale:** Replaces "desperate" with physical descriptor of movement that shows the cause (starvation) and the observable behavior (jerky urgency).

## PASS 4: STRUCTURAL VERIFICATION

### Scene Opening Verification
✓ All 8 scenes open with sensory anchor (environment before interiority):
- Scene 1: "Wei Shufen knelt in the light and counted the dying."
- Scene 2: "The thirtieth wounded arrived at midday."
- Scene 3: "The Sunday service began with hymns."
- Scene 4: "Wei made lists now."
- Scene 5: "A bowl. Wei stares at it."
- Scene 6: "Forty-six days later, the walls broke at dawn."
- Scene 7: "Wei woke to the sound—"
- Scene 8: "Silence. The screaming outside has stopped."

### POV Consistency
✓ All scenes maintain Wei Shufen POV throughout. No head-hopping.

### Dialogue Physical Grounding
✓ All dialogue exchanges include physical grounding:
- Characters move, gesture, work while speaking
- No "floating talking heads"
- Examples: Wei treating wounds during exchanges, Chen gripping his hand, soldiers standing at doors

### Death Scene Requirements (Scene 8)
✓ Extended treatment (1,502 words for death sequence)
✓ Visceral detail (spear through chest, sensory breakdown, blood pooling)
✓ Karmic bridge present:
> "I saved no one. The walls fell. The kingdom fell. Every hand I held went cold.
> But the holding was not nothing.
> The trying is never nothing.
> I will try again."

**Bridge verification:** Seeds Chapter 20 lesson (perseverance through failure, energy/viriya)

### Lilith Power Level
✓ Matches `lilith-arc.json`: "Near-full manifestation"
✓ Intervention: Circumstantial manipulation (cavalry timing, artillery, disease vectors)
✓ Never physically appears (saving manifestation for Manchester in Ch 22)
✓ Pattern invisible to Wei, visible to reader

### Recognition Markers
N/A - User confirmed "no longer needed" per summary context

### Meat/Body Theme
✓ Present throughout all scenes:
- Body as ledger (saved/lost arithmetic)
- Wounds as truth over doctrine
- Starvation (manna vs. body's needs)
- Physical death (visceral, detailed)
- Medicine as hands-on work with flesh

### Genre Conventions (War Epic)
✓ War as system, not villain
✓ Hierarchy as moral corrosion (doctrine vs. reality)
✓ Body as ledger (physical suffering = measure of truth)
✓ Inevitable disillusionment arc (Belief → Function → Fracture → Residual Ethic)
✓ No heroic rescues (evacuation fails)
✓ Death accomplishes nothing strategically

### Assessment
**PASS** - All structural requirements met.

---

## PASS 5: CONTINUITY CHECK

### Character Names
✓ Wei Shufen (魏淑芬) consistent throughout
✓ Supporting characters: Chen, Old Huang, Young Ping, Elder Zhou, Captain Zhou, Elder Fang, Shishuai Fang
✓ All names match `avatar-profile.json` and `period-rules.md`

### Setting Details

✓ Ranks: Lüshuai (captain), Shishuai (major-general) - accurate
✓ Material culture: manna decree, Xiang Army, Holy Treasury, Qing siege tunnels - all historically accurate

### Lilith Consistency
✓ Never physically appears (matches cross-life constraint)
✓ Intervention pattern consistent (invisible, circumstantial)
✓ Power level matches progression (near-full manifestation)

### Prior Scene Alignment
✓ Each scene flows from previous (ledger numbers track correctly)
✓ Character development continuous (disillusionment arc intact)
✓ No contradictions between scenes

### Karmic Bridge
✓ Scene 8 final thought seeds Ch 20 correctly:
  - "I will try again" → perseverance
  - "The trying is never nothing" → outcome-independent energy
  - Failure purified into virtue → viriya (energy) perfection

### Issues Flagged
None.

### Assessment
**PASS** - All continuity verified. No contradictions with documentation or prior scenes.
