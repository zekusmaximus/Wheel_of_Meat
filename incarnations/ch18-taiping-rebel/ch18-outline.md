---

## Scene 1: "The Arithmetic"

**Timeline:** Spring 1862 (morning after a skirmish)
**Location:** West Ward aid station (converted Buddhist temple)
**Word Count:** ~1,400 words
**Function:** Establish Wei's competence, faith, ledger obsession, and plant first seed of pattern

### Opening Image
Wei kneels beside a wounded soldier at dawn. Dust motes in slanted temple light. His hands are herb-stained, moving with practiced precision as he applies a poultice. The smell of medicinal herbs cutting through underlying rot of gangrene.

### Key Beats

**Beat 1: The Triage (300 words)**
- 7 wounded from last night's Qing probe attack on West Wall
- Wei assesses each: 4 will live if he has supplies, 2 might live, 1 will die
- Shows his calculus: brutal, honest, methodical
- The "might live" cases consume most resources
- He makes the call: prioritize the salvageable

**Beat 2: The Ledger Obsession (250 words)**
- Internal: Wei mentally updates his count: "47 saved, 23 lost"
- Since arriving in Tianjing (1853), he's tracked every patient
- This is compulsive helping manifest: must count, must track, must be "the one who saves"
- Brief memory of his mother teaching him herbs (Guangxi, before the rebellion)
- Her voice: "We can't save them all, Shufen. Only try."

**Beat 3: The Faith (300 words)**
- A soldier (Chen) asks Wei: "Will the Heavenly Father protect us?"
- Wei's answer is genuine, not rote: "He protects those who serve Him faithfully"
- Belief is real but not fanatical—Wei questions doctrine quietly
- Shows inherited capacity from Jean: can doubt and still function
- But he believes God rewards his work (contaminated determination)

**Beat 4: The Success (350 words)**
- Wei treats the worst "might live" case: shrapnel in shoulder, infection starting
- Performs impromptu surgery (removal without anesthesia)
- Patient screams, Wei works calmly, removes metal, cauterizes
- Success: patient will live
- Wei feels satisfaction—this is why he does this

**Beat 5: The Return (200 words)**
- A soldier Wei saved last month (Liu) returns to the aid station
- Just checking in, healed wound is holding
- Wei watches him walk out the temple gate, back to duty
- Feels quiet pride: "48 saved, 23 lost"
- **Lilith's touch (invisible):** Liu's unit will be ambushed tomorrow; he will die

### Character Notes
- Wei is competent, methodical, quietly faithful
- Shows compulsive helping: must check every bandage himself
- Voice is clinical, precise: "The wound is clean. Three days of poultice, then light duty."
- Not heroic—administrative, procedural

### Sensory Details
- **Sight:** Dust motes in temple light; faded red tunics; herb-stained hands
- **Smell:** Medicinal herbs, gangrene, incense (old temple smell lingering)
- **Sound:** Screaming during surgery, murmured prayers, distant artillery (background)
- **Touch:** Slick blood, rough bandages, gritty mortar-and-pestle grinding herbs
- **Taste:** Wei chews herbs to test potency (bitter, earthy)

### War Epic Compliance
- **Body as ledger:** Surgery scene shows unfiltered physical reality
- **System as antagonist:** Supplies are rationed; Wei can't save everyone due to scarcity
- **No heroics:** This is administrative medicine, not dramatic rescue

### Closing Image
Wei at the temple doorway at sunset. Watches soldiers drill on the wall. Updates his mental ledger one more time: "48 saved, 23 lost." He doesn't know the numbers are about to invert. Behind him, the temple Buddha's alcove is empty (idol smashed years ago).

### Transition to Scene 2
**Time Jump:** 3 months (Summer 1862)
**Hook:** "Three months later, the count was 71 saved, 58 lost. Too close. Too fast."

---

## Scene 2: "The First Fracture"

**Timeline:** Summer 1862 (three months later)
**Location:** Aid station during mass casualty event
**Word Count:** ~1,500 words
**Function:** Introduce the pattern; show Wei's first loss of someone "saved"; escalate stakes

### Opening Image
Chaos. Wounded flood the aid station—30+ bodies, screaming, blood pooling on temple floor. Wei is already covered in blood, moving patient to patient, making snap triage decisions. Artillery barrage hit a populated section of the West Ward.

### Key Beats

**Beat 1: The Flood (300 words)**
- 30+ wounded arrive in waves
- Wei shifts into pure function: assess, categorize, delegate (though he hates delegating)
- Sort: immediate (will die without intervention), delayed (can wait), expectant (will die regardless)
- Shows his brutal honesty: marks three men as expectant, gives them water (forbidden—hastens death, but it's mercy)

**Beat 2: The Choice (400 words)**
- One man: gut wound, intestines visible
- Wei knows: this is mortal, will die in agony over days
- Options: Leave him (expectant) or waste resources prolonging it
- Wei gives him water, a place to lie down, stays with him briefly
- Man dies within the hour (Wei's small mercy)
- This is Jean's inheritance: honest about what he doesn't know, doesn't lie about prognosis

**Beat 3: The Return (500 words)**
- A family Wei evacuated last month appears in the wounded
- He'd sent them to a "safe" village outside the walls (before siege tightened)
- Parents are dead; only the daughter (age 10?) survived
- Child: shrapnel wound in leg, survivable
- Wei: "But I sent you to safety..."
- Girl, in shock: "The demons shelled the village. Everyone died. We came back."
- Wei operates, saves her leg, but he's shaken

**Beat 4: The Count (300 words)**
- That night, alone in the temple
- Wei recalculates his ledger
- Question he can't answer: Do the dead from the "saved" pool count against him?
- The family—he saved them from a plague outbreak, evacuated them
- They died anyway
- First seed of doubt: "Did I doom them by sending them there?"
- Dismisses it: coincidence, bad luck, the chaos of war

### Character Notes
- Wei is stretched thin, exhausted
- Shows his flaw: tries to personally attend every patient (can't)
- First crack in faith: not in God, but in his own efficacy
- Voice shifts slightly: more clipped, fewer words

### Sensory Details
- **Sight:** Blood pooling on floor, dusty sunlight through smoke, skeletal bodies
- **Smell:** Overwhelming blood, shit (abdominal wounds), smoke
- **Sound:** Screaming (constant), artillery (distant thunder), Wei's calm voice cutting through chaos
- **Touch:** Slick blood, spilled intestines (warm, wet), rough stone floor
- **Taste:** Dust in mouth, metallic (blood in air)

### War Epic Compliance
- **Body as ledger:** Gut wound scene is unflinching
- **System:** Triage as bureaucracy of death; Wei is administrator, not savior
- **Hierarchy:** Wei must obey evacuation orders (which doomed the family)

### Lilith's Intervention
- **Invisible hand:** She adjusted artillery timing
- The "safe" village was shelled because she influenced Qing targeting
- Wei experiences: tragic coincidence
- Reader suspects: too perfectly timed

### Closing Image
Wei burns the corpses outside the temple (disease control). Watches the smoke rise. The girl he saved watches from the temple doorway, silent. Wei thinks: "71 saved, 58 lost. The gap is closing."

### Transition to Scene 3
**Time Jump:** 3 months (Fall 1862)
**Hook:** "By autumn, the Heavenly King's decrees grew stranger, and Wei's ledger grew heavier."

---

## Scene 3: "The Doctrine"

**Timeline:** Fall 1862
**Location:** Sabbath service (morning) → Command meeting (afternoon)
**Word Count:** ~1,300 words
**Function:** Show hierarchy as moral corrosion; theology vs. reality; Wei obeys impossible order

### Opening Image
Crowded Sabbath service. Hundreds packed into a repurposed Confucian hall. Men and women segregated (Wei sits with officers). A preacher rants about God's protection for the faithful. Wei sits, listens, sees men he knows are dying of gangrene in the crowd.

### Key Beats

**Beat 1: The Sermon (300 words)**
- Preacher: "The Heavenly Father shields the righteous! The demons' bullets cannot touch the faithful!"
- Wei looks around: sees soldier missing an arm (lost last week), man coughing blood (tuberculosis)
- Cognitive dissonance: doctrine says they're protected; reality says they're dying
- Wei's inherited capacity: He can hold both truths without rage
- But the gap between them widens

**Beat 2: The Hymn (200 words)**
- Congregation sings (Wei joins, voice low)
- Lyrics about divine victory, demons fleeing
- Wei thinks: We're losing. Slowly. The walls hold, but we're starving.
- Shows he can participate (function) without believing (faith cracking)

**Beat 3: The Impossible Order (500 words)**
- After service: Wei summoned to command meeting
- His commander (Shishuai, Colonel Fang): Orders Wei to release 20 recovered men for a raid
- Wei objects: "They're not ready. Wounds not healed, still weak from blood loss."
- Fang: "The Heavenly King requires it. The raid must proceed."
- Wei: "They will die."
- Fang: "Then they die in service to God. Release them."
- Wei obeys (hierarchy as moral corrosion)

**Beat 4: The Result (300 words)**
- The raid happens off-page (that night)
- Next morning: 18 of the 20 are dead, 2 return (wounds reopened)
- Wei treats the survivors, says nothing
- One dying man: "We were betrayed. They knew we were coming."
- (Reader knows: Lilith influenced the intelligence leak)
- Wei: no bitterness, just registers the failure

### Character Notes
- Wei is caught between doctrine and reality
- He obeys orders he knows are fatal (system crushes him)
- Jean's legacy: clean observation without rage ("They were sent unready. They died.")
- Flaw: counts these 18 as his failures (personal ledger of guilt)

### Sensory Details
- **Sight:** Packed hall, faded banners with Taiping slogans, empty altar (no idols)
- **Smell:** Unwashed bodies (water scarce), incense (religious ritual)
- **Sound:** Hymn singing (off-key, desperate), commander's clipped orders
- **Touch:** Rough wooden bench, reopened sutures (wet, bleeding)
- **Taste:** Stale rice (morning ration)

### War Epic Compliance
- **Hierarchy:** Orders are correct (chain of command) and catastrophic (18 dead)
- **System:** Wei is a cog; refusing would destroy discipline, save no one
- **No heroics:** He doesn't rebel, doesn't speechify, just obeys and counts the cost

### Lilith's Intervention
- Intelligence leak to Qing about the raid timing
- The 18 deaths are directly her doing (testing her power)
- Wei experiences: betrayal, bad planning, normal war chaos

### Closing Image
Wei alone in the temple, updating his ledger. "103 saved, 97 lost." Nearly even. He kneels before the empty Buddha alcove (habit), but doesn't pray. Just sits in silence.

### Transition to Scene 4
**Time Jump:** 6 months (Spring 1863)
**Hook:** "By spring, the siege was a stranglehold, and Wei had become a student of patterns."

---

## Scene 4: "The Pattern"

**Timeline:** Spring 1863 (six months later)
**Location:** Aid station + brief foray into the West Ward
**Word Count:** ~1,600 words
**Function:** Wei consciously recognizes the pattern; superstition takes root; ledger inverts

### Opening Image
Wei sits at a makeshift desk (plank over two stones) with a piece of charcoal and scrap paper. He's making a list—names of 15 people he personally saved and tracked. He's checking on them methodically. This is obsession.

### Key Beats

**Beat 1: The Investigation (400 words)**
- Wei has been tracking specific patients (the compulsive helping as detective work)
- He visits or asks about each of the 15:
  - 5 killed in action (normal attrition)
  - 3 died of disease shortly after recovery (bad luck?)
  - 2 executed for desertion (harsh, but not unusual)
  - 2 killed in "accidents" (falling debris, friendly fire)
- Total: 12 of 15 dead within weeks/months of being saved
- Statistical impossibility gnaws at him

**Beat 2: The Conversation (400 words)**
- Another medic (Old Huang, a veteran) notices Wei's obsession
- Huang: "You're tracking ghosts, Shufen."
- Wei: "They're not ghosts. They were saved."
- Huang: "Nothing's saved here. We're all dying on installment. You just choose who pays first."
- Wei: defensive, but Huang's words land
- Huang: "You think you're cursed?"
- Wei: "No. I... I don't know."

**Beat 3: The Whisper (400 words)**
- Wei overhears soldiers talking near the aid station
- Soldier A: "Don't let the lüshuai treat you. Everyone he touches dies."
- Soldier B: "That's superstition."
- Soldier A: "Is it? Liu, Chen, the whole second squad—all dead within a month."
- Wei hears this, says nothing, walks away
- The whisper spreads: Wei is cursed
- (Some soldiers start refusing treatment or requesting different medics)

**Beat 4: The Return of the Girl (400 words)**
- The girl from Scene 2 (the evacuee whose family died) returns
- She's been living in the West Ward with other orphans
- Now: starving, traumatized
- Wei recognizes her, feels gut-punch of guilt
- "You sent us away. Everyone died."
- She's not accusatory—just stating fact
- Wei treats her for malnutrition, gives her extra ration (his own)
- Thinks: "You're the curse. I'm the curse."

### Character Notes
- Wei is unraveling—obsessive tracking intensifies
- First time he questions himself, not just doctrine
- Flaw deepens: cannot accept that some things are beyond control
- Voice: more internal, fragmented ("They died. All of them. Why?")

### Sensory Details
- **Sight:** Charcoal list (names smudged), skeletal orphans, dust everywhere
- **Smell:** Starvation (sweet, wrong smell of ketosis), rot, smoke
- **Sound:** Whispers, distant shelling (constant now), hollow coughs
- **Touch:** Rough paper, girl's bony wrist (taking pulse), cold stone
- **Taste:** Wei's own ration (dry rice, weeds mixed in—foreshadowing manna)

### War Epic Compliance
- **System:** The siege is killing more than bullets; logistics is the enemy
- **Body:** Starvation as slow violence; Wei can't fix systemic failure
- **Disillusionment:** Wei moves from function to fracture

### Lilith's Intervention
- All 12 deaths arranged by her: artillery, disease vectors, intelligence failures
- The pattern is deliberate, supernatural, but looks like war
- Wei experiences: dawning horror that he's the common factor

### Closing Image
Wei burns the list of names. Watches the charcoal smudge into ash. Updates ledger: "133 saved, 128 lost." The gap has closed. He thinks: "Five. I have five left before I've killed more than I've saved."

### Transition to Scene 5
**Time Jump:** 9 months (Winter 1863-64)
**Hook:** "Winter brought manna from heaven. It tasted like ash and failure."

---

## Scene 5: "The Manna"

**Timeline:** Winter 1863-1864
**Location:** Aid station + Holy Treasury distribution point
**Word Count:** ~1,700 words
**Function:** Theology collapses; body truth over doctrine; Wei shifts from fracture to residual ethic

### Opening Image
A bowl. Wei stares at it. Inside: weeds, grass clippings, some unidentifiable plant matter. This is "manna"—the Heavenly King's decree. The bowl sits in his hands. He doesn't eat. Around him, civilians choke it down.

### Key Beats

**Beat 1: The Decree (300 words)**
- Hong Xiuquan's proclamation (read aloud by a commissioner):
  - "The Heavenly Father provides manna, as He did for the Israelites."
  - "Eat the sweet dew from the palace gardens. God will sustain the faithful."
- Reality: The "manna" is weeds, roots, bark
- Nutritionally void; causes dysentery, vomiting
- Wei knows this is delusion, not divine provision
- First time he consciously rejects Taiping theology

**Beat 2: The Distribution (400 words)**
- Wei at the Holy Treasury distribution point
- Civilians line up; children with distended bellies (kwashiorkor from malnutrition)
- Wei distributes the manna ration (as Sim a, he's responsible for 25 families)
- Faces ethical horror: "Who gets the last real rice? Who gets only weeds?"
- Chooses: children get rice, adults get manna
- Watches them eat it, watches them get sick

**Beat 3: The Plague (500 words)**
- Dysentery outbreak in Wei's ward (from contaminated manna/water)
- 50+ cases; Wei has no medicine, no clean water
- He boils rags for bandages, uses ash to pack wounds
- Watches people die from preventable disease
- The body as ledger: starvation and disease are slower than bullets, but just as fatal
- Wei works mechanically—no prayer, no hope, just function

**Beat 4: The Crisis of Faith (500 words)**
- A dying man (Elder Zhou, a believer from the early days) asks Wei:
  - "Why does the Heavenly Father allow this?"
- Wei has no answer (honestly doesn't know)
- Zhou: "Perhaps we have sinned. Perhaps the manna is our test."
- Wei, internal: "This is not God. This is a man lying to himself while his people starve."
- First open rejection of theology (not just doubt—dismissal)
- But he doesn't tell Zhou this (compassion: some lies ease the passage)

**Beat 5: The Choice to Stay (200 words)**
- Wei could flee—officers have defected, some accepted by Qing
- Considers it (briefly)
- Stays, but not for God
- Why? "Because they need someone who knows medicine."
- Function replaces belief: he helps because it's what he does, not because God commands

### Character Notes
- Wei is disillusioned but not broken
- Theology collapses; duty remains
- Shows inherited capacity from Jean: acts under uncertainty without bitterness
- Voice: stripped down, bleak ("The boy will die. I give him water anyway.")

### Sensory Details
- **Sight:** Distended bellies, skeletal limbs, green-tinged manna in bowls
- **Smell:** Dysentery (shit and rot), boiling water, smoke
- **Sound:** Vomiting, weeping, hollow coughs, silence (people too weak to talk)
- **Touch:** Cold stone, bony wrists (checking pulses), slimy manna
- **Taste:** Wei forces himself to try manna (bitter, earthy, wrong)

### War Epic Compliance
- **Body as truth:** Ideology (manna as divine) collapses when the body starves
- **System:** The Holy Treasury has failed; distribution is theater
- **Disillusionment:** Wei completes the arc—residual ethic emerges

### Lilith's Intervention
- Disease vectors she influenced (contaminated water sources)
- The manna itself is not her doing (that's historical), but she ensures it kills Wei's patients faster

### Closing Image
Wei stops counting his ledger. Realizes: "Saved" and "lost" are meaningless categories. Everyone here is dying; he's just choosing the speed. He looks at his herb-stained hands, sees they're shaking.

### Transition to Scene 6
**Time Jump:** 5 months (June 1, 1864)
**Hook:** "On the first day of the sixth month, the Heavenly King ascended. Or so they said."

---

## Scene 6: "The King is Dead"

**Timeline:** June 1-3, 1864
**Location:** Aid station + streets of Tianjing
**Word Count:** ~1,500 words
**Function:** Hong dies; Wei's crisis peaks and breaks; the breakthrough moment

### Opening Image
Runners bring news at dawn. Hong Xiuquan is dead. Official story: "Ascended to heaven to sit at the right hand of the Heavenly Father." Reality (whispered): He ate manna, went mad, died raving.

### Key Beats

**Beat 1: The Death (300 words)**
- News spreads through the city
- Reactions vary: some weep (true believers), some riot (rage at the lie), some are silent (Wei)
- Wei feels: nothing. Emptiness.
- The Heavenly King was the theological keystone; without him, the structure collapses
- Wei: "He was just a man. Eating weeds. Like the rest of us."

**Beat 2: The Collapse (400 words)**
- Social order breaks down (briefly)
- Soldiers abandon posts; civilians riot at the Holy Treasury (empty anyway)
- Wei's aid station is untouched (people still need medicine, even in chaos)
- But wounded from the riot arrive: trampling injuries, a stabbing
- Wei works, but his mind is elsewhere

**Beat 3: The Paralysis (400 words)**
- That night, alone in the temple
- Wei sits in the empty Buddha alcove, stares at nothing
- The curse theory consumes him: "Everyone I help dies. Hong is dead. The Kingdom is dead. I am the common factor."
- Conclusion: "I should stop. I'm making it worse."
- **He stops working**—refuses new patients, tells them to see Old Huang
- For two days, he sits idle (Lilith thinks she's won)

**Beat 4: The Child (400 words)**
- Third day: A child (boy, age 7?) stumbles into the temple
- Wounded—shrapnel from riot, bleeding from arm
- Stares at Wei, bleeding
- Wei stares back
- Long moment: he could ignore him, let him die, prove the curse is real
- The choice crystallizes:
  - "If I help him, he will die. The pattern is certain."
  - "But he's bleeding now. And I can stop that."
- **The Breakthrough:** "It doesn't matter if I'm cursed. He needs help."
- Wei picks up his tools, treats the wound
- No prayer, no doctrine, no hope it will matter
- Just: "This is what I do"

### Character Notes
- Wei hits bottom (paralysis) and finds bedrock (residual ethic)
- Adhiṭṭhāna achieved: outcome-independent determination
- Voice shifts: quieter, simpler ("The wound is deep. I clean it.")
- Compulsive helping purified: not about counting anymore, just about helping

### Sensory Details
- **Sight:** Empty streets (people hiding), child's wide eyes, blood on stone
- **Smell:** Smoke from burning (riot fires), blood, dust
- **Sound:** Distant weeping, eerie silence (no artillery for once), child's shallow breathing
- **Touch:** Cold stone (Wei has been sitting for days), warm blood, needle and thread
- **Taste:** Stale manna (all Wei has eaten in days)

### War Epic Compliance
- **System collapse:** Hong's death reveals the structure was always hollow
- **No redemption:** Wei's breakthrough doesn't save anyone
- **Body truth:** The child's bleeding is immediate; theology is abstract

### Lilith's Intervention
- She watches this moment (from Ch19 POV)
- Realizes: "No. He's supposed to stop. Why is he helping?"
- The backfire begins

### Closing Image
The child leaves, bandaged. Wei watches him go. Thinks: "When the walls break, he'll die anyway. But not from this wound. Not today." Wei returns to work.

### Transition to Scene 7
**Time Jump:** 6 weeks (July 19, 1864)
**Hook:** "Forty-six days later, the walls broke at dawn."

---

## Scene 7: "The Walls Break"

**Timeline:** July 19, 1864 (dawn to mid-morning) - Real-time
**Location:** Aid station → West Wall → evacuation route
**Word Count:** ~2,000 words
**Function:** Application of purified determination; Wei organizes futile evacuation; sees the pattern's hand

### Opening Image
Explosion. Wei wakes to the sound—wall collapsing, dust cloud rising, screaming. He knows immediately: This is the end. He sits up, reaches for his medical bag (automatic), and moves.

### Key Beats

**Beat 1: The Breach (300 words)**
- Qing forces tunneled under the wall, packed it with explosives
- West Wall section collapses at dawn
- Xiang Army floods through the gap
- Wei's ward: 40 wounded (cannot move), ~200 civilians, 15 soldiers
- Gunfire getting closer; Wei has minutes, not hours

**Beat 2: The Arithmetic (Reprise) (400 words)**
- Wei calculates (echoes Scene 1 ledger):
  - 40 wounded: cannot evacuate (will die here)
  - 200 civilians: maybe 100 mobile enough to run
  - 15 soldiers: could fight through or escort civilians
- Escape routes: West Gate (probably surrounded) or river (suicide)
- The math: Most will die. Organizing evacuation may save 20-30.
- **Wei organizes it anyway**

**Beat 3: The Orders (400 words)**
- Wei tells the 15 soldiers: "Take the mobile civilians. Try the West Gate. Fight through if you can."
- One soldier (young, terrified): "Lüshuai, come with us."
- Wei: "My place is here." (Gestures to the 40 wounded)
- Soldier: "They're dead anyway."
- Wei: "Yes. But I'm not leaving them."
- Soldiers obey, begin evacuation

**Beat 4: The Evacuation (500 words)**
- Wei leads ~100 civilians toward the West Gate
- Chaos: streets clogged with fleeing people, Qing soldiers entering the city
- Wei sees a woman who might be his sister (ambiguous—long-separated, he's not sure)
- Calls out, she doesn't hear (or doesn't recognize him)
- Gets the civilians to the gate, sees them off
- Watches from a distance as they attempt to flee
- **Lilith's final intervention:** Qing cavalry "happens" to intercept
- The civilians are cut down in the street
- Wei watches from the temple steps—they're slaughtered
- He saved no one

**Beat 5: The Return (400 words)**
- Wei returns to the 40 wounded inside the temple
- They can hear the massacre outside (screaming, gunshots, closer)
- A young soldier (boy, really—17?) asks: "Lüshuai, will it hurt?"
- Wei lies: "No. It will be quick." (Jean's honesty + necessary compassion)
- He kneels beside them, waits for the Qing
- No prayer, no last words, just presence
- Holds the boy's hand

### Character Notes
- Wei is calm—determination is purified, no longer contaminated by hope
- He knows this is futile; does it anyway
- Voice: stripped to essentials ("Try the West Gate. Go now.")
- Compulsive helping gone—this is just what's right

### Sensory Details
- **Sight:** Dust cloud from explosion, civilians running, cavalry cutting them down
- **Smell:** Gunpowder, smoke, blood, dust
- **Sound:** Explosion (deafening), screaming (constant), gunfire (staccato), silence inside temple (eerie)
- **Touch:** Medical bag strap (worn leather), boy's hand (cold, trembling)
- **Taste:** Dust, blood in mouth from breathing hard

### War Epic Compliance
- **System:** The walls were always going to fall; Wei can't change that
- **No heroics:** Evacuation fails; Wei's actions accomplish nothing strategically
- **Body as ledger:** The massacre is physical, brutal, unsparing

### Lilith's Intervention (Visible to Reader)
- Cavalry interception is too perfectly timed (reader suspects)
- Ch19 will reveal: she arranged it
- Wei experiences: tragic coincidence, normal massacre

### Closing Image
Wei kneels beside the wounded in the temple. The boy's hand in his. They wait. Outside: screaming stops, footsteps approach.

### Transition to Scene 8
**Time:** Immediate (continuous)
**Hook:** No break—Scene 8 is the death, uninterrupted

---

## Scene 8: "The Ledger Closes"

**Timeline:** July 19, 1864 (midday) - Real-time (final minutes)
**Location:** Inside the aid station temple
**Word Count:** ~1,800 words
**Function:** Death scene; bridge to Ch20; close the ledger; demonstrate adhiṭṭhāna achieved

### Opening Image
Silence. The screaming outside has stopped. Wei and the 40 wounded in the temple. Dusty sunlight through smoke. Footsteps approaching—heavy boots on stone.

### Key Beats

**Beat 1: The Wait (400 words)**
- Wei and the wounded wait in silence
- Some pray (Taiping prayers, quiet)
- Some weep
- Some are silent
- Wei: present, calm, functional
- He mentally reviews his life (not the ledger—the ledger is abandoned):
  - His mother teaching him herbs in Guangxi
  - His sister's laugh (before the segregation)
  - The first patient he saved (a farmer, spear wound, 1851)
  - The thousands who came after

**Beat 2: The Question (400 words)**
- Wei thinks: Jean's question echoes (though he doesn't know it's Jean's):
  - "What deserves conviction?"
- His answer (internal):
  - "This. Them. Now."
  - "Not God. Not the Kingdom. Not success."
  - "The act of helping. That's what deserves conviction."
  - "The trying is never nothing."
- Adhiṭṭhāna fully realized: outcome-independent determination

**Beat 3: The Qing Arrive (500 words)**
- Xiang Army soldiers burst into the temple
- See: 40 wounded, one man in a red tunic (officer)
- Wei stands, unarmed, between soldiers and the wounded
- Hands raised (not surrender—just: I am not a threat)
- Buys ten seconds (that's all)
- Qing soldiers pause (brief recognition: medic, not combatant)
- Then orders: "No quarter. Kill them all."

**Beat 4: The Death (400 words)**
- Spear through Wei's chest (quick, as he promised the boy)
- Falls backward, lands on the stone floor
- Sensory details (final moments):
  - **Sight:** Dusty sunlight through smoke, temple ceiling, the boy's face (terrified)
  - **Sound:** Screaming resumes (soldiers killing the wounded), Wei's breath (wet, failing)
  - **Smell:** Incense (old temple smell, lingering under blood)
  - **Touch:** Cold stone under his back, warm blood spreading
  - **Taste:** Blood, copper
- Wei's awareness narrows (tunnel vision)
- Hears the boy scream (cut off)
- Knows: they're all dying

**Beat 5: The Final Thought (BRIDGE) (100 words)**
Wei's last thought (exact words—this is critical):

> *"I saved no one. The walls fell. The kingdom fell. Every hand I held went cold.*
>
> *But the holding was not nothing.*
>
> *The trying is never nothing.*
>
> *I will try again."*

(This seeds Ch20: perseverance, energy, determination through failure)

### Character Notes
- Wei dies as he lived: functional, present, helping
- No rage, no bitterness, no regret
- Adhiṭṭhāna complete: he helped knowing it was futile, for its own sake
- Final thought is not about God or doctrine—just the act itself

### Sensory Details
- **Sight:** Ceiling beams, dust motes, fading light
- **Smell:** Incense (memory trigger—his mother's temple), blood
- **Sound:** Screaming (distant, fading), wet breathing (his own)
- **Touch:** Cold stone, warm blood, spear in chest (pressure, then numbness)
- **Taste:** Blood, copper, earth

### War Epic Compliance
- **Death accomplishes nothing:** Evacuation failed, wounded die, city falls
- **No redemption:** Wei's sacrifice is meaningless strategically
- **Body truth:** Death is physical, painful, unglamorous
- **Meaning in attempt:** The war epic allows this—trying matters even when failing

### Closing Image
Wei's body on the temple floor. Eyes open, staring at the ceiling. One hand still reaching toward the boy (frozen mid-gesture). Blood pools around him. Outside: the massacre continues. The ledger is closed.

## Post-Scene Notes

### Continuity to Chapter 19
**What Ch19 (Lilith POV) Will Reveal:**
- She watched the evacuation interception (arranged the cavalry timing)
- She watched him die still helping (shock and frustration)
- Her realization: "I made futility visible. All I did was purify him."
- The backfire complete: intervention accelerated his perfection

### Continuity to Chapter 20
**What Ch20 (Noir Detective) Will Inherit:**
- Capacity to persist through repeated failure
- Energy/perseverance that doesn't require victories
- Understanding that trying matters independent of outcomes
- Question: "If trying matters even when it fails, what is worth trying when the system itself is the enemy?"

### Verification Checklist

Before drafting, ensure:
- [ ] All scenes comply with war epic principles
- [ ] Body-as-ledger: Every scene shows physical cost
- [ ] Disillusionment arc: Belief → Function → Fracture → Residual Ethic
- [ ] Historical accuracy: Dates, rations, ranks, weapons correct
- [ ] Lilith invisible: No physical appearance; pattern only
- [ ] Ledger motif: Tracked across scenes 1-5, abandoned in 6
- [ ] Wei's voice: Precise, clinical, soft-spoken throughout
- [ ] Final thought exact: Seeds Ch20 correctly
- [ ] No heroics: Death accomplishes nothing strategically
- [ ] Timeline compression: Clear jumps, smooth transitions
