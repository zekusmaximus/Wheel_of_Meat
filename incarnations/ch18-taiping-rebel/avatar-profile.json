  "psychology": {
    "core_flaw_manifestation": "Cannot delegate medical care; must personally check every bandage. Obsessively tracks 'saved' vs 'lost' count in mental ledger. Attachment to being 'the one who saves them.' Sense of personal failure when patients die, even from mortal wounds.",
    "fatal_flaw": "Attachment to outcomes; determination contaminated by need for success and divine validation",
    "strengths": [
      "Medical skill (traditional herbal medicine + battlefield surgery)",
      "Calm under pressure (makes triage decisions without panic)",
      "Leadership through competence (men trust him rather than fear him)",
      "Clean doubt inherited from Jean (can question theology without bitterness)",
      "Honest to the point of bluntness with dying patients"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Attachment to outcomes (contaminated determination at start)",
      "Overwork (exhausts himself trying to save everyone)",

      "Cannot delegate even when overwhelmed"

    "internal_voice": {
      "characteristics": [
        "Precise, clinical descriptions of wounds and symptoms",
        "Methodical counting and listing (the ledger obsession)",
        "Soft-spoken in dialogue",
        "Honest to the point of bluntness ('You will die. I cannot stop it.')"
      ],
      "example": "The boy's wound is mortal—intestines perforated, infection spreading. Three days, perhaps four. I tell him he will recover, because some lies ease the passage. But I do not lie to myself. I add him to the count."

  "chapter_arc": {
    "opening_state": "Spring 1862: Competent, faithful but not fanatical, quietly optimistic. Believes 'God protects those I save.' Mental ledger: 47 saved, 23 lost. Determination is contaminated by theology and outcome-attachment.",
    "inciting_incident": "Pattern of deaths emerges among those he saves. What begins as bad luck becomes statistically impossible—evacuees killed by shelling, healed soldiers sent to suicide missions, infections spreading to his patients. By 1863, soldiers whisper he is cursed.",
    "development": "1862-1863: Losses mount; ledger inverts (more lost than saved). Doctrine vs reality creates cognitive dissonance. Inherits Jean's capacity for clean doubt—questions theology but doesn't become bitter. Growing dread: 'Everyone I save dies. Am I cursed?'",
    "crisis": "Winter 1863 - June 1864: Theology collapses. Hong's 'manna' decree (eating weeds) reveals delusion. Hong's death (June 1, 1864) shatters divine protection narrative. Wei stops helping, believing he is cursed. Lilith thinks she has won.",
    "climax": "June 1864: Wounded child appears before Wei. He hesitates—then helps anyway, knowing it may be futile. Breakthrough: 'It doesn't matter if I'm cursed. She needs help.' True adhiṭṭhāna achieved—outcome-independent determination.",
    "closing_state": "July 19, 1864: Dies during the Qing massacre after organizing evacuation he knows will fail. Stays with wounded who cannot flee. Dies protecting them. Final thought: 'I saved no one. But the trying was not nothing. I will try again.'"

    "what_learned": "True determination is outcome-independent. Commitment to helping belongs to the act itself, not to the hope of success. The trying matters even when it fails. Purified determination from theological belief, divine reward expectations, and ego attachment to 'saving' people.",
    "what_failed": "Initial determination was contaminated: dependent on belief in God's protection, attached to successful outcomes, driven by identity as 'the one who saves.' Failed to recognize that futility does not negate rightness of action.",
    "death_seeds_next": "Seeds Ch20 (Noir Detective): Capacity to persist through repeated failure. Determination that doesn't require victories. Energy/perseverance (viriya) in the face of systemic corruption and unsolvable cases.

      "how_manifests": "Wei can doubt Taiping theology without becoming bitter. He doesn't need theological certainty to act. He can question doctrine while still functioning as healer/leader. This allows him to maintain determination even after faith collapses."

  },
  "notes": "Wei Shufen represents the purification of determination through futility. His arc demonstrates that true adhiṭṭhāna is outcome-independent—commitment to helping others regardless of success, divine reward, or personal validation. The siege provides the perfect crucible: a war epic where systems crush individuals, where the body pays the price ideology demands, and where meaning exists in the attempt rather than the achievement. Lilith's opportunistic intervention (while tracking him forward to modern times) backfires by forcing this purification, accelerating rather than hindering his spiritual development. This is the penultimate historical avatar before modern Silas—spiritually advanced, working on the 8th perfection, two lives away from stream-entry."
