- Buddhist terms found: 2 → Fixed
  - "consciousness" → changed to "awareness"
  - "attachment" in prose → changed to "need"

- [x] POV consistent throughout (Lilith only, historical bleeds through her perception)
- [x] Dialogue physically grounded (handshake, positioning, reception context)
- [x] Death scene requirements: Met (Jack's death with visceral detail, karmic bridge to present)
- [x] Lilith power level appropriate: Yes (constant, near-Buddha, no physical deterioration)
- [x] Recognition markers: Present (widow's peak, green crescent eye, same face)
- [x] Meat/body theme: Present (pain in chest, physical pull, handshake as touch)
- [x] Genre conventions: Honored (noir atmosphere, integrated prose technique)
```

---

## Pass 5: Continuity Check

```
CONTINUITY CHECK
- Character names: Verified (Lilith Blackwood, Silas Pahlavan/Azami, Jack Malone)
- Setting details: Verified (Manchester faculty reception, LA 1938, Buick Roadmaster)
- Lilith consistency: Verified (widow's peak, dark strand, pale green crescent in left eye)
- Prior scene alignment: Verified (continues from Ch 19's positioning complete, job secured)
- Karmic bridge: Verified (Jack's death → Silas in present, "passerby rushing to avoid" matches Ch 20)

```

## Pass 6: Lilith Chapter Verification

```
LILITH CHAPTER VERIFICATION
- [x] Opens with dual sensory anchor (rain in two cities, felt in skin/heard on windows)
- [x] No transition markers between timelines (integration is grammatical, not structural)
- [x] Sensory bridges present: rain, gray light, glass, sound of crowds, temperature, pain
- [x] Conjoined actions: 5+ (scanning room/bar, setting down drink, walking toward, turning)
- [x] Manchester presence maintained throughout (never absent for more than one paragraph)
- [x] Parallel mistake visible to reader, invisible to her (obsessive pursuit, can't stop)
- [x] Fetter intensification beat: "If I can't stop him, I'll bind him" - pivot to intimacy strategy
- [x] No physical deterioration (exhaustion filed, not manifesting as somatic collapse)
- [x] Maitreya foreshadowing: 3 moments
  1. "Whose heart is racing?" - consciousness blur (Movement 3)
  2. Pain felt when bomb explodes - his death in her body (Movement 4)
  3. "Walking toward him the way water walks toward the sea" - pull exceeding strategy (Movement 5)
- [x] Period integration flavor: Matches Ch 20 (noir rain, cigarette smoke, failure repeated, atmospheric)
- [x] Forbidden patterns scan: Clean after corrections
- [x] Connects to historical Ch 20: Verified (Jack's death, Buick Roadmaster, March 1938, passerby)
```

## Summary

**All verification passes: COMPLETE**

Chapter 21 successfully implements the 5-movement braid structure with integrated prose throughout. The superposition beat (Movement 4) achieves the required fusion of Jack's death and Lilith's first sighting of Silas. All three Maitreya seeds are placed with appropriate subtlety. The fetter intensification beat crystallizes the pivot to intimacy strategy. The chapter connects seamlessly to Ch 19 (positioning complete) and Ch 20 (Jack's death scene).
