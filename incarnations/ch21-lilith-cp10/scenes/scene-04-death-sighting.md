March 1938. Rain in the alley behind Jack's boarding house.

The Buick Roadmaster sat in its usual spot, its black paint beaded with water, chrome dulled by weeks of neglect, while Jack worked the case that was killing him. He walked toward it with his coat pulled tight, one more day of trying, one more morning of choosing to continue when continuation was insane. The letter in his pocket. The gun in his shoulder holster. The certainty settling through him that today was the day, though he couldn't have said how he knew.

She was turning away already. Positioned at the edge of the alley, close enough to see, already walking. She'd seen enough. Knew how this ended.

The reception continued—

—she was at the edge of Silas's conversation, the colleague departing, the opening arriving—

—Jack reached for the car door—

—she reached for the moment, the approach, the face she'd been tracking across centuries—

Rain on metal. Rain on windows. Both sounds arriving through the same awareness, the same body that stood in Manchester and stood in Los Angeles and could not tell which stance was primary, which city was real, which timeline held her and which she was only observing.

He opened the door—

—the colleague smiled and turned away—

—the smell of old leather, cigarettes, the mustiness of sitting too long—

—the smell of wine, cologne, the staleness of institutional air—

The car seat creaked as Jack settled behind the wheel.

Silas turned toward her—

—and across the room, through the crowd, through the rain-streaked windows behind him, she saw the face she'd been tracking—

—he looked out the windshield at the alley, at the rain, at the gray morning—

—she looked at him, at the recognition flickering in features she'd watched die a hundred times—

—and then he saw her—

—standing at the end of the alley, a woman in a dark coat, the sharp widow's peak, the single darker strand falling across her forehead—

—their eyes met across the reception room—

—their eyes met across the wet pavement—

—recognition flickered in his expression, unable to catch—

—her left eye flickered, the pale green crescent—

—a passerby, rushing to avoid—

—a colleague, approaching to introduce—

He turned the key—

—he turned toward her—

—and she was already turning away—

—and she was already stepping forward—

White. Heat. The silence after noise.

A tearing in her chest. Sharp. Localized. Real.

The explosion registered as pressure first—wave of force, glass shattering, metal screaming—and then as pain that had no source in her body, no wound in her chest, nothing that explained why she was doubled over in Manchester while a car burned in Los Angeles while the reception continued around her and no one noticed that she had stopped breathing.

His death. Felt in her body.

Filed under exhaustion. Left unexamined.

She kept walking—through the reception, toward Silas, away from the burning Buick—both motions the same gesture, the approach and the retreat indistinguishable. The ache in her chest where Jack's death still echoed. The pull toward Silas that had exceeded strategy somewhere in the last thirty seconds and become what she would not name.

The rain fell in both cities. The violence continued in both registers.

And the realization crashed down:

Every intervention. All backfires.

Minimal presence. Maximal presence. It didn't matter.

Everything she did accelerated him. Made the lessons clearer. Purified what she meant to poison. Jack dying with that phrase in his mind, 'the trying is not nothing', while she watched from the edge of the alley, while she approached from across the reception room, while both gestures revealed the same truth she could not see.

Complete. Every door she'd tried to lock had opened from the inside.

She had made the futility visible. She had ensured every case Jack worked failed. She had accelerated his failures the way she'd accelerated Wei's, the way she'd accelerated all of them, and every time the acceleration became the lesson, became the purification, became the exact thing she was trying to prevent.

The thread continued. He was HERE. She could feel how close—the weight of it pressing against her own architecture, the door about to open.

Historical intervention: impossible.

The weight of centuries pressing down. Every avatar. Every method. Every failure stacked on failure until the stack became the pattern and the pattern became the truth she refused to see.

One option remained.

She stood in the reception room in Manchester, present day, autumn rain against windows The ache in her chest refused to fade, and Jack's body lay on wet pavement sixty-seven years ago, and somewhere in the space between those facts the decision crystallized.

If I can't stop him, I'll bind him.

The words arrived without source, without doctrine, just the weight of necessity felt in her bones. She would meet him. Make him love her. Become indispensable.

Be close enough to intervene at the critical moment.

But even as the strategy formed, a current beneath it stirred with nothing to do with intervention and everything to do with the pain in her chest, the pull in her architecture, the recognition she kept experiencing and refusing to name.

She stood very still. Let the pain move through her. Let the realization settle.

Then she crossed the last few feet of distance and extended her hand.
