Rain on two cities. She felt it in her skin before she heard it on the windows.

The faculty reception hummed with the particular violence of small talk. Cclinking glasses, murmured conversation, institutional lighting that flattened everything to the same professional gray. Across the room, through the crowd, through rain-streaked windows that looked out on Manchester autumn, she saw him. Not yet. Almost. The thread she'd tracked across centuries ended in this room, and she could feel it pulling, the same pull that had pulled her through Tianjing's siege, through the glimpses between significant lives, through the nine interventions that had backfired into exactly what she'd tried to prevent.

Week nine of tracking. Or ten. She'd stopped counting days when the pursuit became fever.

In the bar in downtown Los Angeles, January 1938, smoke hung in layers and jazz bled from the jukebox, notes falling like rain on tin, and Jack Malone worked his contacts at the bar with the kind of determination that showed even in how he held his glass. She was positioned near the back. Victory rolls, dark lipstick were the uniform of the era. Nursing something she wouldn't drink.

She watched him work, and the accumulated progress became visible.

He wasn't making Ka's mistake. The isolation was gone—he shared information freely, worked networks, collaborated with sources even when it endangered him. Chandra's ledger-mind had dissolved into something cleaner; this one gave without counting, took cases from people who couldn't pay, offered his time without expectation of return. The diagnostic clarity persisted—she watched him piece together the corruption pattern, see the system behind the scattered crimes. Philon's wisdom intact, the capacity to observe clearly while remaining engaged. He maintained ethical standards despite impossible pressure, had walked away from his career rather than compromise. Verinus's rigid certainty absent—he acted virtuously without requiring procedural purity.

Even Macarius's performance had dissolved. This one lived simply, no heroic posturing, no accumulation of moral credit. Kaoru's grasping had released—he accepted that cases failed, held his losses without letting them freeze his work. And there: Diego's patience. The capacity to endure injustice without becoming bitter. Jean's truthfulness—honest doubt that didn't paralyze him. Wei's determination—outcome-independent, continuing because it was right rather than because it would succeed.

Nine patterns, integrated into behavior before she could observe him struggling with any of them.

What remained was the identity itself: *Someone has to give a damn.* The attachment not to helping but to being the one who helps.

He was about to complete the tenth. And then—

Her hands tightened on the glass she wouldn't drink.

The same rain that fell on Manchester fell on nothing in LA's dry winter, but she felt it anyway, moisture in two registers, the sensory bridge holding both frames in the same breath.

The pull toward him, toward Silas, had become physical. An ache in the architecture of her chest that had no source she could name, no wound she could treat. The thread hummed. The reception continued. She scanned the room the way Jack scanned his contacts, the same gesture across decades, both of them looking for someone who could change everything.

He didn't notice her. She didn't need him to.

Another one who can't stop, she thought, watching Jack work the room, watching herself work the room, the parallel forming before she could suppress it. His obsessive pursuit of the Haversham case. Her obsessive pursuit of the soul that kept escaping her interventions. Both of them reaching across distance toward something they couldn't quite touch.

The clink of glasses at the reception. The clink of glasses at the bar. Rain against tall university windows. Rain against LA's single bar window in January when it shouldn't rain but did, because she was there, because her attention made the weather behave strangely, because tracking across timelines left residue in both frames.

She set down her untouched drinks, bourbon in the bar, wine at the reception, both glasses sweating in her peripheral awareness, and she began to move.

The crowd parted. Or she moved through it. The geometry of a thousand years of practice reduced to footwork, to positioning, to the slow navigation toward the face she'd been watching die for longer than she could remember.

Finally. Finally close enough.

But not yet. Not quite.

The bar. The reception. The rain on glass in two cities.

Both held. Both true. Both bleeding through the membrane of her attention like temperature through skin.

And the wheel turned, carrying her toward the moment she'd been building toward since she first recognized his thread in Ka's desperate isolation, since she first understood that someone was approaching the threshold at the same rate she was, since the race began and she started running and found she could not stop.
