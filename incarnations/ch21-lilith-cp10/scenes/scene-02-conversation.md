# Scene 2: The Conversation

The faculty mixer occupied the same room it always occupied, the same wine served in the same plastic cups, the same conversations circling the same topics with the weary persistence of people who had given up expecting anything new. Lilith held her glass without drinking, positioned near the windows where she could monitor both entrances while appearing to study the early evening light on the campus green.

The room smelled of cheap Merlot and the particular staleness of institutional carpet. Someone had arranged cheese cubes on a tray that no one was eating. The heating system laboured audibly against windows that leaked cold air, producing a background hum that made every conversation feel slightly provisional.

She had spotted Silas twenty minutes ago, near the far corner where the philosophy contingent had gathered around Dr. Harrison, who was holding forth on something that required expansive hand gestures. Silas stood at the edge of the group, his wine untouched, his attention on Harrison but his posture suggesting patience rather than engagement. He was waiting for the monologue to end. They all were.

A voice at her elbow: "Dr. Azami?"

Lilith turned. Dr. Brennan—David, she remembered, medieval literature, divorced with two children he mentioned too often—was standing beside her with the particular slump of a man who needed to unburden himself. His tie was loosened, his face flushed from wine or frustration or both.

"David." She adjusted her stance to face him, the movement calibrated to suggest availability without enthusiasm. "Surviving the evening?"

"Barely." He glanced around the room with the expression of someone surveying wreckage. "Can I ask you something? Professionally, I mean. If you have a moment."

She had been planning to drift toward the philosophy cluster within the next ten minutes, but opportunities for the demonstration presented themselves when they chose to, not when she planned them. "Of course."

Brennan took a breath, the kind that preceded confession. "There's a student. Third year, been struggling since he arrived. I've worked with him—tutorials, extensions, office hours, everything short of writing his essays myself. Three years of effort, and he's no better than when he started. Probably worse, actually."

He paused, shaking his head at something only he could see. "I don't know why I keep trying."

The words hung in the air between them, and Lilith felt something crystallize—the moment arriving as if it had been waiting for her, which perhaps it had. She looked at Brennan's face, at the genuine weariness there, at the question he was really asking beneath the surface complaint.

"Because the trying is the point."

Her voice was calm, precise, the clinical register that had served her through a thousand similar conversations. "Outcomes are beyond our control. We can offer what we have to offer—attention, knowledge, patience—but whether the student receives it, whether they're capable of receiving it, whether receiving it changes anything for them... that's not ours to determine."

Brennan was watching her with the particular hunger of someone who wanted to be convinced.

"The effort itself has value," she continued. "Not because it succeeds, but because it's offered. You've been present for this student in ways that matter, regardless of whether the grades reflect it. That presence—that commitment to keep showing up—isn't nothing. It might be everything."

Something eased in Brennan's shoulders. He nodded slowly, the motion carrying the weight of a man setting down a burden he'd been carrying too long.

"Thank you," he said. "I needed to hear that."

"Any time."

He drifted away toward the wine table, and Lilith returned her attention to the room—to the philosophy cluster, to Silas still standing at its edge, to the evening that was unfolding according to plan.

Ten years of effort that kept backfiring. Eight incarnations where her interventions had accelerated rather than obstructed. A decade of trying that had produced the opposite of its intended results, and still she continued.

The irony didn't register. She was already moving toward the philosophy corner, her glass raised slightly to suggest she was seeking a refill, her path calculated to intersect with the group just as Harrison's monologue exhausted itself.

---

The conversation narrowed in stages.

First the larger group dissolved—Harrison departing for another wine, two junior lecturers escaping toward the door, the remaining cluster fragmenting into smaller configurations. Then the smaller configuration dissolved too, colleagues drifting toward spouses or early dinners or simply the relief of leaving. Until finally it was just Lilith and Silas, standing by the windows as the evening deepened outside, their plastic cups empty, neither of them moving toward refills.

"You're still here." His observation carried no accusation, only the mild curiosity of someone noting an unexpected phenomenon.

"So are you."

He smiled. The lines around his eyes deepened in a way she had catalogued across a hundred observations but still found herself studying. "I was waiting for Harrison to finish. By the time he did, everyone else had left. And then you were here."

"Convenient."

"Or something else." His gaze met hers, and she felt the particular attention he brought to everything—the quality she had tracked through lifetimes, the patience and observation that had worn different names in different eras. "You always seem to be where the interesting conversations are."

"I have excellent timing."

"You have excellent everything, from what I can tell." He said it without flirtation, as simple assessment. "Your contemplative research, the work on Eastern traditions, the way you handled the Wilson crisis last month. You're good at what you do."

The Wilson crisis—a second-year who had experienced a dissociative episode during finals week. Lilith had spent four hours with him, grounding him through techniques she could have performed in her sleep, techniques she had developed across lifetimes of similar interventions. The faculty had been impressed. Silas had been watching.

"I've had practice." She let the statement carry weight it couldn't explain. "The mind is my territory, after all. Just as consciousness is yours."

"Consciousness." He repeated the word as if tasting it. "An increasingly crowded field. Everyone wants to explain it now—the neuroscientists, the philosophers, the physicists with their quantum speculations. I sometimes think we're all circling the same elephant, describing different parts and insisting we've found the whole."

"Our friend Jung," she heard herself say, "the embodied consummation of our vocations."

Silas's expression shifted—recognition, and something more. "You've read the Lectures."

"Psychology and religion. The overlap isn't accidental."

"No." He was studying her now with a different kind of attention. "It isn't."

The heating system cycled off, leaving a silence that felt less like absence than presence. Outside the windows, the campus had emptied, the paths dark except for the pools of light beneath the lampposts. Someone had dimmed the lights in the function room, whether by accident or intention, and the shadows had gathered in the corners like guests who refused to leave.

"What's your practice?" The question emerged before she could evaluate it strategically. "I've read your papers—the phenomenological approach to introspection, the integration of Eastern methods with Western frameworks. But what do you actually *do*?"

He was quiet for a moment. When he spoke, his voice had dropped into a register she hadn't heard before—intimate, almost confessional.

"I sit." Simple words, carrying weight. "Every morning, before anything else. I sit and I watch what arises. Not trying to change it, not trying to achieve anything. Just watching."

"For how long?"

"Fifteen years now. Twenty, if you count the early fumbling."

She knew this. She had tracked this. But hearing him say it, watching his face as he said it, produced a response in her chest that she filed under professional interest.

"And what have you found?"

"That there's less there than I thought." He smiled again, but it was different now—softer, almost rueful. "Less self, I mean. Less of whatever I used to think I was. The watching keeps revealing that the watcher isn't quite what it seems."

*Closer than I calculated.* The assessment formed with clinical precision. *The first three fetters weakening. Perhaps a year from the threshold. Perhaps less.*

She should feel alarm at this. Should feel the urgency of a decade compressing into months, of plans that needed acceleration, of strategies that required adjustment. Instead, she felt—

"Sometimes I think—" He stopped, shook his head.

"What?"

"It's strange. I was going to say something, and then I knew you were about to say it too."

Her breath caught, barely perceptible. "What were we going to say?"

"That the closer you get to seeing through the illusion, the less it matters whether you see through it. That the effort becomes its own point."

The words landed in her like a key finding a lock she hadn't known existed. She had just said something similar to Brennan—*the trying is the point*—but hearing it reflected back in Silas's voice, framed in his language, produced a resonance that felt almost physical.

*A year of studying him. Of course I know his patterns. Of course we think along similar lines.*

"The effort becomes its own point," she repeated carefully. "That's... yes."

The evening had stretched without her noticing. The function room was empty now except for them, the catering staff beginning to clear the tables with the deliberate movements of people who wanted to go home. Through the windows, the campus had transformed into a geometry of shadows and light.

"I should let you go," she said, though neither of them moved.

"Should you?"

The question hung between them. Not an invitation, exactly. Not a proposition. Something more careful than that, more considered. The question of two people who had orbited each other for a year and were only now acknowledging the gravity.

"Perhaps not yet," she allowed.

His smile returned, and something in her chest responded that she filed under *rapport necessary for the strategy*.

"There's a pub," he said. "Near campus. Quieter than this."

"I know it."

"Of course you do."

They left together, their footsteps synchronizing without either of them choosing to synchronize them, and Lilith noted the phenomenon with the same clinical attention she brought to everything.

*Assessment: twelve months until the threshold. Perhaps less. The intimacy strategy remains viable. Proximity is producing results.*

The spring evening was cold, and Silas's shoulder brushed hers as they walked, and she did not move away.
