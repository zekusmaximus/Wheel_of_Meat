# Scene 1: Loose Weave

Rain on two cities. She felt it in her skin before she heard it on the windows.

The faculty reception hummed with the particular violence of small talk—clinking glasses, murmured conversation, institutional lighting that flattened everything to the same professional gray—and across the room, through the crowd, through rain-streaked windows that looked out on Manchester autumn, she saw him. Not yet. Almost. The thread she'd tracked across centuries ended in this room, and she could feel it pulling, the same pull that had pulled her through Tianjing's siege, through the glimpses between significant lives, through the nine interventions that had backfired into exactly what she'd tried to prevent.

Week nine of tracking. Or ten. She'd stopped counting days when the pursuit became fever.

In the bar downtown—Los Angeles, January 1938—smoke hung in layers and jazz bled from the jukebox, notes falling like rain on tin, and Jack Malone worked his contacts at the bar with the kind of determination that showed even in how he held his glass. She was positioned near the back. Victory rolls, dark lipstick—the uniform of the era. Nursing something she wouldn't drink. The same rain that fell on Manchester fell on nothing in LA's dry winter, but she felt it anyway, moisture in two registers, the sensory bridge holding both frames in the same breath.

The pull toward him—toward Silas—had become physical. An ache in the architecture of her chest that had no source she could name, no wound she could treat. The thread hummed. The reception continued. She scanned the room the way Jack scanned his contacts, the same gesture across decades, both of them looking for someone who could change everything.

He didn't notice her. She didn't need him to.

Another one who can't stop, she thought, watching Jack work the room—watching herself work the room—the parallel forming before she could suppress it. His obsessive pursuit of the Haversham case. Her obsessive pursuit of the soul that kept escaping her interventions. Both of them reaching across distance toward something they couldn't quite touch.

The clink of glasses at the reception. The clink of glasses at the bar. Rain against tall university windows. Rain against LA's single bar window in January when it shouldn't rain but did, because she was there, because her attention made the weather behave strangely, because tracking across timelines left residue in both frames.

She set down her untouched drink—bourbon in the bar, wine at the reception, both glasses sweating in her peripheral awareness—and began to move.

The crowd parted. Or she moved through it. The geometry of a thousand years of practice reduced to footwork, to positioning, to the slow navigation toward the face she'd been watching die for longer than she could remember.

Finally. Finally close enough.

But not yet. Not quite.

The bar. The reception. The rain on glass in two cities.

Both held. Both true. Both bleeding through the membrane of her attention like temperature through skin.

And the wheel turned, carrying her toward the moment she'd been building toward since she first recognized his thread in Ka's desperate isolation, since she first understood that someone was approaching the threshold at the same rate she was, since the race began and she started running and found she could not stop.
