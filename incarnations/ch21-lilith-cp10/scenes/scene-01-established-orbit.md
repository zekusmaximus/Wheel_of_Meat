# Scene 1: The Established Orbit

Spring had returned to Manchester with its usual ambivalence—daffodils pushing through the soil outside the library, but the wind still carrying February's chill across the quad. Lilith walked the path she had worn smooth over twelve months, her heels clicking against the flagstones in a rhythm that had become as familiar as her own pulse.

One year since the interview. One year since she had become Dr. Azami to the faculty, Lilith to him.

The campus spread before her in the early light, that particular quality of English morning that made everything look provisional, as if the sun might change its mind at any moment and retreat behind clouds. Students hurried past in small clusters, their breath visible in the cold air, conversations fragmenting into laughter and complaint as they dispersed toward buildings that mixed Victorian brick with modern glass additions. The smell of wet stone rose from the walkways, mingling with coffee from the cart near the Samuel Alexander Building and something sweeter—cherry blossoms, perhaps, from the trees along the western edge of the quad.

She had engineered all of this.

The position with student counseling services had been the first move. A clinical role that required no research output, no publications, no long-term commitment—just competence and availability, both of which she could manufacture as easily as breathing. The interview panel had been impressed by her NHS credentials, her meditation research, her theoretical work on contemplative traditions. They hadn't questioned why a psychiatrist with her publications was taking what amounted to a lateral move. Universities rarely questioned gift horses.

The rest had followed with the precision of a chess game played against an opponent who didn't know they were at the board. Faculty mixers where she positioned herself near the philosophy department cluster. Committee assignments that overlapped with his. A shared interest in consciousness studies that she cultivated through strategic questions at departmental seminars. The slow accumulation of proximity that looked, from the outside, like nothing more than professional collegiality.

Crawford House rose ahead of her, its Victorian facade unchanged by the century and a half since it was built. Her office was on the second floor, a small room with a window overlooking the quad—not prestigious, but functional, and more importantly, central. From there she could track the rhythms of the campus, the patterns of movement that brought certain people past certain buildings at certain times.

Patterns she had memorized.

She paused at the entrance to check her phone. Nothing urgent—a reminder about today's faculty event, a message from a colleague about a student referral. She didn't check her personal email anymore. Nadia had stopped writing months ago, the weekly messages tapering into biweekly, then monthly, then silence. Their mother sent Christmas cards with photographs of family gatherings Lilith hadn't attended. The flat she returned to each night contained only her and the notebooks and the work that had consumed everything else.

The trade had been worth it. She was certain of this, or certain enough that the certainty served its purpose.

Movement at the edge of her vision. She looked up.

Silas was crossing the quad from the direction of the Arthur Lewis Building, a leather satchel slung across his chest, his rumpled coat unbuttoned despite the cold. He was talking to a student—a young woman with short hair and an anxious posture—his head inclined toward her, his attention complete. Even from fifty metres, Lilith could see the patience in his bearing. The way he listened without checking his watch or glancing toward his destination. The quality she had tracked through eight lifetimes, adapted now to academic robes and morning tutorials.

He looked up.

Their eyes met across the distance. He smiled—the easy smile of recognition, of familiarity built through a year of shared coffee breaks and faculty debates and the kind of conversations that academics had when they discovered someone who actually thought about the same questions. She raised her hand in acknowledgment, a small wave that meant nothing and everything.

He nodded and returned to his student, guiding her toward the steps of the Arthur Lewis Building, and Lilith watched them go with a sensation in her chest that she filed under professional interest.

The architecture had worked. The proximity had produced results. They were colleagues now. Friends, even—or something that functioned like friendship, that felt like friendship, that she had designed to feel like friendship while serving purposes friendship was never meant to serve.

Tonight would be different.

The faculty mixer was scheduled for six o'clock, the kind of dreary departmental event that universities inflicted on their staff in the name of community building. Wine in plastic cups, conversation about budget cuts and student evaluations, the usual complaints about parking. She had attended dozens of them over the past year, positioning herself carefully, never too eager, never too distant.

But tonight she would move.

The decision had crystallized over the past week, though perhaps it had been forming for longer than that. The tracking sessions had shown her his progress—the meditation deepening, the clarity increasing, the first three fetters weakening with each month that passed. He was close. Closer than she'd calculated when she'd first found him. Perhaps a year from the threshold, perhaps less.

She didn't have time for more waiting.

Her hands were steady as she pushed through the doors of Crawford House. Her heartbeat was calm, measured, the rhythm of a woman who had spent ten years preparing for this moment. The receptionist nodded as she passed, and Lilith returned the greeting with precisely calibrated warmth—present but not excessive, friendly but not familiar.

This was what ten years of work looked like. Not the notebooks, not the tracking sessions, not the intervention attempts that had backfired across eight centuries. This: walking into a building where she belonged, preparing for an evening where she would begin the final phase of something that had started before she could remember.

She climbed the stairs to her office, unlocked the door, and stood for a moment at the window.

Silas had disappeared into the Arthur Lewis Building. The quad was emptying as morning lectures began. The cherry blossoms swayed in a breeze that carried the promise of warmth it wouldn't keep.

Tonight.

She turned from the window and began her day.
