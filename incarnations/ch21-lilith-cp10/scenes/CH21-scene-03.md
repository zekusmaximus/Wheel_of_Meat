She was close enough now. Could hear his voice.

Silas stood at the edge of the philosophy cluster, discussing something with a colleague. Contemplative practice, therapeutic intervention, the intersection of meditation traditions and clinical work. His voice: measured, warm, certain in a way that didn't announce itself. The same certainty she'd heard in Jack's voice on a phone call she'd been close enough to overhear.

"Someone has to give a damn about these people."

The phrase arrived across decades, across the sensory bridge that connected the faculty reception to a phone booth in downtown LA, February 1938. Jack, calling a contact, making his case for why the Haversham investigation mattered. The same conviction. The same inability to stop.

She positioned herself at the edge of the conversation. Listening. Waiting for the opening. The colleague was a woman in her fifties in Victorian studies, Lilith's peripheral awareness supplied without effort. She was wrapping up, making polite noises about having to circulate. The opening was approaching. The moment crystallizing.

Something wrong. Something tearing.

The timelines wouldn't hold still. She was losing the boundary between watching and wanting, between the reception's wine-and-fluorescent haze and the bar's smoke-and-whiskey weight, between the pull toward Silas and the pull toward—what? What was she being pulled toward, besides the target, besides the strategy, besides the race that had her moving with urgency she called necessary?

Jack's voice on the phone: "The trying matters. Even if it doesn't work. Someone has to—"

Silas's voice at the reception: "—the practice isn't about achieving anything. It's about showing up. Consistently. Without attachment to outcome—"

Both voices bleeding together. Both saying the same thing in different registers.

Her heart raced. The scent of wine, cologne, institutional carpet. The scent of rain, exhaust, desperation. Both arriving through the same awareness, the same breath, the same body that stood at the edge of two conversations happening decades apart.

Whose heart is racing?

Hers, watching Silas speak? Or Jack's, walking toward his boarding house in the rain, toward the car that waited in the alley, toward the ending she already knew was coming?

For a moment she couldn't tell. The boundary wavered. She was both of them and neither—observer and observed, tracker and tracked, the awareness that followed the thread and the thread itself, indistinguishable.

Then the memory surfaced—the street corner, the rain, the way he had stopped when he saw her face. The way his eyes had searched hers for something he couldn't name.

*He recognized me.*

Not the woman in the bar. Not the passerby on the street. Her. Across the incarnations, across the veil that should be impenetrable, he had looked at her face and something in him had known.

*The lives are bleeding through. He's approaching threshold faster than any previous incarnation.*

The realization settled into her chest like ice. Ten interventions—active, minimal, circumstantial—and every single one had accelerated exactly what she'd tried to prevent. But this was different. This was evidence that the accumulated lives were beginning to speak to each other. Beginning to recognize patterns. Beginning to see her.

Historical intervention could not touch this. Could not slow it.

She was out of time.

She dismissed it as tracking fever. The strain of holding both timelines. Exhaustion from the weeks of sustained attention, the positioning, the work that had brought her to this room, this moment, this approach.

Not examined. Never examined.

The parallel was becoming undeniable:

Jack, chasing the Haversham case, knowing he couldn't win. Lilith, chasing Silas, knowing intervention didn't work. Both obsessive. Both outcome-attached. Both unable to stop even when stopping was the only sane response.

His pursuit was killing him. Hers was binding her.

The trying is not nothing, Jack thought—or would think, was thinking, the tenses collapsing in her awareness the way the timelines had collapsed.

One more method. One more approach. She thought—or was thinking, would think until the thought became the only thing she knew.

Rain drowning both cities. Hearts racing in both chests. The pull toward Silas exceeding strategy, exceeding calculation, exceeding even the race that had defined her for—how long? Since Ka? Since before?

She saw the parallel in him. Watched Jack's determination crystallize into something pure, something that had released its grip on outcome and become just trying for the sake of trying.

She could not see that she was doing the same thing.

The colleague finished speaking. Began to turn away. The opening arrived like a door swinging open onto everything that would follow—the approach, the introduction, the intimacy strategy that was also something else, something the pull suggested but she refused to name.

Whose heart?

The question dissolved before she could answer it. She stepped forward into the space the colleague had vacated, and the rain continued in both cities, and the wheel turned beneath her feet, and she did not see what she was becoming in the act of becoming it.
