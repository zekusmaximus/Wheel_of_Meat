# Scene 9: Coda — The Edge



A Sunday afternoon in late spring, the light slanting through his windows at the angle that meant summer was approaching whether Manchester believed it or not.



She sat on his sofa with her legs curled beneath her, a book open in her lap that she had stopped pretending to read. He was in the kitchen, making tea with the sequence of motions she knew by heart now—kettle first, cup warming, leaves measured by instinct. The flat smelled of Earl Grey and old books and the particular warmth of a space that two people had begun to share.



Her book was on his shelf. One of the volumes from her flat had migrated here weeks ago, and she hadn't asked for it back. His tea—the blend she preferred—had appeared in her kitchen without discussion. The vocabulary of a couple settling into each other's lives, the small surrenders of territory that meant more than either of them acknowledged.



She watched him through the archway.



He was concentrating on the tea with the same attention he brought to everything—his sitting practice, teaching, the way he listened when she spoke. The grey in his hair caught the light. The lines around his eyes had deepened in the year she'd known him, but the deepening was gentle, the kind that came from expression rather than erosion.



*Twelve months*, she thought. *Maybe less.*



The timeline had compressed again. In the weeks since she'd first calculated it, his practice had intensified. She could see it in the quality of his attention, in the clarity of his latest paper, in the way he spoke about consciousness now—not as an academic topic but as lived experience. Whatever threshold he was approaching, he was approaching it faster than she'd predicted.



He was close. Closer than a year. Closer than she wanted to admit.



*He's approaching the threshold. I'm supposed to stop him.*



The thought arrived with less urgency than it should have carried. She had spent a decade—longer than a decade, eons—orienting herself toward this moment. The point of the proximity was intervention. The point of the intimacy was control. The point of everything she had built was to be positioned, when the moment came, to act.



But looking at him now—watching him pour water over tea leaves, watching him move through his kitchen with the ease of someone who had found his footing—she felt something that contradicted the strategy.



*Not yet.*



The thought surprised her. Not for the sentiment—she had been feeling some version of it for weeks—but for the form it took.



*Stay a little longer.*



Not *I need more time to position myself.* Not *the strategy requires additional preparation.* Just: *stay.* As if his remaining on this side of the threshold were something she wanted for its own sake. As if the closeness they had built were valuable beyond its tactical purpose.



*Strategic timing*, she told herself. *I'm not ready to act yet. The intervention requires specific conditions. Wanting him to stay is part of ensuring those conditions are met.*



The explanation was logical. It fit the framework she had spent ten years constructing. It made sense of the feeling in terms that didn't threaten everything she thought she knew.



But the explanation felt thin. Like a garment that no longer fit.



He emerged from the kitchen with two cups, handed her one with the particular care of someone who knew how she liked to hold things. Their fingers brushed in the exchange. From somewhere outside, the sound of a church bell marking the hour—one of the old Manchester churches that still kept time for no one in particular.



"You've been staring at that book for an hour," he observed, settling into the chair across from her. "I don't think you've turned a page."



"I've been thinking."



"About?"



She looked at him. At the face she had tracked through eight other faces. At the soul she had followed since before she could remember beginning to follow. At the man who was approaching a threshold that supposedly admitted only one, who would either complete first or cycle again, whose progress she had spent eons trying to obstruct and had somehow spent the past year accelerating.



"Nothing," she said. "Just—this."



The word carried everything she couldn't say. This: the flat, the tea, the afternoon light. This: the year they had built together, the conversations and silences and nights in each other's arms. This: whatever they had become, whatever they were becoming, whatever waited on the other side of conversations neither of them had started.



He held her gaze for a long moment. His expression shifted through something she couldn't quite read—recognition, maybe, or understanding, or the particular attention he brought to things that mattered.



"Just this," he repeated. The words weren't a question.



"Yes."



She wasn't sure what she was agreeing to. Something larger than the afternoon, larger than the moment, larger than the careful framework of strategy and position she had maintained for so long.



He smiled. The expression transformed his face in the way it always did, softening the lines, reaching his eyes, making him look like someone who had found something worth finding.



"That's enough," he said. "This is enough."



The light through the windows had shifted while they talked, the afternoon beginning its slow decline toward evening. His tea steamed gently in his hands. Hers had cooled without her noticing.



*Twelve months*, she thought. *Maybe less.*



*I'm supposed to stop him.*



*I'm not going to stop him.*



The realization landed without fanfare. Without the drama she might have expected. Just: acknowledgment. The recognition of something that had been true for weeks, maybe longer, that she was only now allowing herself to see.



She wasn't going to stop him. Wasn't going to intervene. Wasn't going to use the proximity she had built for the purpose she had built it.



Not because the strategy had failed. Not because she lacked the position or the opportunity.



Because she didn't want to.



Because whatever *this* was—this afternoon, this flat, this man—it had become more valuable than what she had spent eons pursuing.



Because somewhere in the accumulation of days, she had started to believe that the trying was the point. That outcomes were beyond control. That the effort itself had value.



Because David Brennan had asked her how to keep going when nothing worked, and she had told him the truth without knowing it was the truth.



*The trying is the point.*



She set her cup aside. Stood. Crossed to his chair.



He looked up at her with the patience he brought to everything. She leaned down and kissed him—not strategically, not tactically, just because she wanted to. Because the wanting had become its own reason.



When she pulled back, his eyes were bright.



"What was that for?" he asked.



"Nothing," she said. "Just—this."



He pulled her down beside him. The chair wasn't designed for two people, but they made it work, the way they had made everything work over the past months. Her head found the hollow of his shoulder. His arm circled her waist.



Outside, the light continued its decline. Summer was coming. The year they had built together was approaching its first anniversary. The threshold he was walking toward remained, waiting, a door that would open when he was ready.



She wasn't going to close it.



The thought should have felt like failure. Like the collapse of everything she had worked for, the defeat of eons of effort.



Instead, it felt like something else.



*Stay a little longer*, she thought, and let herself mean it.



*Just a little longer.*



*And then...*



She didn't finish the thought. Didn't need to. Whatever came next would come. The confession, the threshold, the question of what happened when two beings approached the same exit together.



For now, there was this: an afternoon, a flat, a man she had followed through eight deaths and was finally letting herself love.



For now, that was enough.
