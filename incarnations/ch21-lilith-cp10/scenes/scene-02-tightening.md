# Scene 2: Tightening

She spotted Silas across the reception room. Philosophy faculty cluster near the windows—rain still falling behind them, the gray light making everything look underwater, submerged. He was talking to a colleague, gesturing with one hand while the other held a wine glass he hadn't drunk from. The gesture was familiar. The patience in it. The certainty that didn't announce itself.

She began navigating through the crowd. Casual. Deliberate. The calculations felt automatic now—where to stand, when to move, how to appear incidental while closing distance with the precision of a scope zeroing. A thousand years of practice distilled into footwork. A thousand lives watched, tracked, intervened upon, and now this: the final approach.

Gray light through university windows. Gray light through rain-streaked windshield.

February 1938. Jack navigating through dead-end leads, the Haversham case eating him alive the way all his cases ate him alive, the way her tracking ate her. She was positioned outside a diner where he'd gone to chase another contact, another source, another thread that would go nowhere. Rain in LA again—wrong season, wrong coast, but the tracking made the weather sympathetic, made it rain in both cities, both centuries.

He walked past.

Looked up.

Something in her left eye—the pale green crescent that didn't belong, that showed only in certain light, that marked her across every incarnation she'd taken. A flicker of color. Recognition that couldn't quite crystallize. He blinked, and it was gone, and he kept walking, and she watched him chase another dead end while she tilted a detail from distance.

The witness who would have talked. Now wouldn't. A phone call that arrived at the wrong moment, a piece of evidence misfiled, a delay that turned cooperation into silence. Afterthought intervention, barely attended to, because she wasn't really paying attention to Jack anymore.

He was the past. Silas was the future.

Nine interventions. Nine backfires. Perhaps distance was the answer. Perhaps minimal presence would succeed where maximal presence had failed—a test, a hypothesis, the kind of clinical reasoning that had sustained her through centuries of watching souls she couldn't save from the lessons she was trying to prevent.

Jack kept walking. Kept trying. The determination in his shoulders, in his stride, in the way he refused to stop even when stopping was the only sane response. Outcome-independent perseverance building in his bones while she accelerated his failures from outside, teaching him the lesson faster without seeing that she was learning the same lesson, had been learning it since Ka's frozen cave, since the first moment she recognized the pattern and decided to fight it.

The reception continued in her peripheral awareness. She was getting closer to Silas. Through the crowd. Through the decades. The same navigation, different scale. The same determination, different register.

Both of them: unable to stop.

Gray light. Both cities wearing the same exhausted afternoon, the same violence of calm, the same pressure that preceded storms in every era she'd witnessed.

She moved through the reception the way Jack moved through his investigation. Deliberate. Relentless. Blind to everything except the target, the thread, the face she was approaching with certainty that felt like gravity, like water seeking its level, like the specific pull of completion approaching.

But she called it positioning. Called it strategy. Called it the necessary next move after nine historical interventions had failed and only present-day engagement remained.

The interpretation was clean. The interpretation was wrong.

And beneath it—beneath the calculation, beneath the strategy, beneath the clinical precision—something else was building. Something that had nothing to do with prevention and everything to do with recognition.

She didn't look at it. Kept navigating. Kept closing the distance.

The rain continued in both cities. The pursuit continued in both centuries.

And the wheel turned, carrying her closer.
