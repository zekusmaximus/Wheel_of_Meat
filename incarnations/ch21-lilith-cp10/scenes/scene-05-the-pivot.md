# Scene 5: The Pivot

If I can't stop him, I'll bind him.

The decision crystallized in the space between heartbeats, between the ache in her chest and the face before her, between the burning car in Los Angeles and the rain against Manchester windows. Historical intervention: impossible. The pattern was clear. Every attempt a backfire. Every transformation achieved precisely because she'd tried to prevent it.

But proximity—

Meet him. Make him love her. Become indispensable.

Be close enough to intervene at the critical moment.

One threshold. One door. One of them crosses.

This time, she would be close enough to hold him back.

The strategy felt clean. Felt logical. Felt like the necessary next move after all other moves had failed.

She didn't ask why proximity felt necessary beyond tactic. Didn't ask why the thought of being close to him felt like relief, like homecoming, like the specific recognition of something long sought. Didn't examine the pull that had exceeded strategy somewhere in the last hour, somewhere in the superposition of his death and her approach, somewhere in the pain she'd felt when the bomb went off and filed under exhaustion without looking at it.

Called it positioning. Called it strategy.

Her body knew what her mind refused.

She was walking toward him the way water walks toward the sea.

The colleague had departed. Silas stood alone for a moment, wine glass in hand, attention turning toward her as she approached. The distance closing: ten feet, five, three. Each step complete. Each breath deliberate. The geometry of a thousand years of practice reduced to this final approach.

Noir receded to body-memory. The ache in her chest where Jack's death still echoed. Rain falling in both cities, in her body, in the space between past and present that her awareness held like temperature held in glass. But Manchester was dominant now. The reception solid around her. The moment arriving.

She extended her hand.

"Dr. Azami, isn't it? I'm starting with student services next week. I've read your work on contemplative practice and therapeutic intervention."

Professional. Collegial. The cosmic masked as casual.

He turned. Saw her.

For a moment—recognition that flickered and failed to catch. Something in his expression shifted, realigned, reached toward a memory that wasn't quite there. Rain. Another city. A passerby. The woman who had been walking away while his car exploded, who had watched from the edge of the alley, who had appeared in glimpses across months of investigation without ever quite resolving into presence.

He blinked, and it was gone.

"Dr. Azami." He took her hand. His grip was warm. Certain. "I look forward to working together."

The handshake held. Longer than professional. Something passing between their palms that neither of them named—recognition, connection, the specific electricity of two souls approaching the same threshold from opposite directions.

Or not opposite. Not quite.

Finally, she thought. Finally close enough.

The pull that had grown beyond strategy settled into satisfaction she called tactical, relief she called positioning, warmth she called nothing at all. His hand in hers. Real. After all the centuries of watching, finally—touch.

She smiled—the smile she'd practiced across incarnations, the one that revealed nothing—and let go before it could mean anything.

But it already did.

Rain continued against the windows behind them. The reception continued around them. Somewhere sixty-seven years ago and three thousand miles away, Jack Malone's body lay on wet pavement while sirens approached, while the story that would run on page eight was already being written, while the thread that connected all of it—Ka to Chandra to Philon to Verinus to Macarius to Kaoru to Diego to Jean to Wei to Jack to this moment—pulled taut and hummed with proximity.

She thought: This time. This time I'll be close enough.

The reader knows what she cannot see: this is the moment she binds herself.

The intimacy strategy that will be the most powerful accelerant of all. The binding that will bind her, not him. The approach that will become need that will become the final bind made flesh, made relationship, made the thing she must release before the threshold can open.

But she doesn't see it. Can't see it. The blind spot is perfect, protected by the very competence that lets her see everyone else's attachments while remaining invisible to her own.

She stands in the faculty reception with his handshake still warm in her palm, and the rain continues, and the wheel turns, and the pattern larger than her awareness moves toward its resolution.

Two halves approaching.

Neither knowing they are halves.

Both calling it something else—strategy, competition, the race toward a door only one can enter.

But the pull knows. The pain knows. The handshake knows.

And somewhere beneath the strategy, beneath the calculation, beneath everything she refuses to examine, something is already beginning that will not end until they see what they've been becoming all along.

The reception continued. The rain continued.

And Lilith Azami, master of temporal perception, architect of countless intrusions, stood three feet from the soul she'd been tracking across centuries and began the work that would finally show her what she could not see.

The work continued.

The wheel turned.

And neither of them knew they were already home.
