# Scene 7: The Merger Dream



The dream began like all her dreams now began—with him.



She was standing in a room that wasn't quite his flat and wasn't quite her own. The proportions were wrong, the walls too far apart, the ceiling too high. Books lined the shelves, but she couldn't read their spines. Light came from somewhere, but she couldn't find its source.



He was there. Standing across from her, looking at her with eyes that held something she couldn't name.



Then the dream shifted.



She was looking through his eyes. Not at him—through him. Seeing what he saw. The room from his angle, the light on his side of the space, her own face visible across the distance. She was both viewer and viewed, occupying two positions simultaneously.



Not metaphor. Not symbol. Literal experience, as real as waking.



*I'm seeing myself*, she thought—but the thought wasn't quite hers. It came from somewhere else, somewhere that was also her but also him, a perspective that refused to sort itself into separate containers.



The dream shifted again.



Now there was no distance. No room. No positions to occupy. Just awareness looking at itself through eyes that had been two and were now somehow one. Her body and his body existed somewhere below, separate forms housing a single attention that could perceive both simultaneously.



*We're the same*, the awareness thought. *We've always been the same.*



The thought carried no surprise. It felt like recognition—the kind that came from remembering something you'd always known but temporarily forgotten. Like coming home to a place you'd never left.



*One set of eyes. Two different views. But the looking is the same.*



The dream held her there—held them there—in the space where boundaries didn't exist. She tried to find where she ended and he began, and the effort produced nothing. The edges weren't blurred; they simply weren't. The distinction between self and other had become a language she no longer spoke.



*How long have we been this?* she wondered—or he wondered—or they wondered together.



*Always*, came the answer. *We've always been this.*

She woke dislocated.



The first moment of consciousness carried the residue of the dream, the disorientation of having been something other than what she was accustomed to being. She didn't know which of them was waking. Didn't know which body contained her. The room was dim, dawn not yet arrived, and in the darkness, she couldn't find the edges of herself.



His breath beside her. Her breath beside him. The faint scent of his skin—sandalwood and sleep—reached her nostrils, but she couldn't tell if she was smelling him or remembering what he smelled like from inside the dream.

Which was which?



She turned her head—or did she?—and saw his face in the grey light. Peaceful. Untroubled. Whatever dreams he was having, they weren't disturbing his rest.



But she could feel him. Not through the mattress, not through the proximity of bodies. Through something else. An awareness of his awareness, as if part of her attention had migrated into his skull and was now looking back at the woman lying beside him.



*I'm here*, she thought. *In this body. On this side of the bed.*



But the certainty felt thin. Provisional. Like a story she was telling herself rather than a fact she was experiencing.



She sat up slowly, the motion confirming that her body was where she thought it was, that her limbs responded to her intentions, that the distinction between self and other still applied in the physical world even if the dream had collapsed it.



His breath changed. Deepened for a moment, then settled back into sleep. She watched his chest rise and fall, and she felt her own chest rise and fall, and for a long moment, she couldn't tell if the rhythms were the same or merely similar.



*Overidentification.*



The clinical assessment arrived like a lifeline. She grabbed it with both hands.



*Overidentification. The cost of proximity. Ten years tracking one soul—of course my mind maps onto his. Dreaming of merger is a predictable psychological response to intensive observation. Nothing more.*



The explanation was reasonable. Supported by research she could cite if necessary. The kind of explanation that would satisfy a colleague, a supervisor, anyone who wanted to understand why two people who spent significant time together might begin to experience boundary confusion.



*I've been watching him for a decade. Living with him for months. Sleeping beside him night after night. The unconscious processes this much input by generating dreams of union. It's not mystical. It's just how brains work.*



She repeated this to herself while her breathing synchronized with his without her choosing it. While the boundary between observer and observed remained thinner than it should have been. While the residue of the dream refused to evaporate with the night.



*Ten years tracking one soul. Of course my mind maps onto his.*



But the dream hadn't felt like mapping. It had felt like revelation.

A question surfaced before she could suppress it.



*If we're both this close to completing...*



She knew what she meant. They were both approaching the same threshold. She had tracked his progress across lifetimes; she knew her own position on the path. Two beings, nearing the same destination, circling the same goal that supposedly admitted only one.



*If the threshold admits one...*



The phrase she had carried for eons. *Together doesn't hold.* Only one of them could complete. The exit was singular. The prize went to whoever arrived first.



*Why does proximity feel like—*



She stopped the thought before it could finish forming. Refused to let the question complete itself. Some thoughts were dangerous to think, dangerous to even begin, dangerous to allow into the space where language could give them shape.



*Strategy*, she told herself instead. *Proximity serves the strategy. The merger dream is a side effect of successful implementation. Nothing more.*



But the question hadn't gone away. It had just retreated, back into the darkness where dreams came from, waiting for another night to resurface.



---



Dawn arrived slowly.



The light came in stages, grey becoming less grey, shadows acquiring edges, the room revealing itself piece by piece. His face became visible again—the features she had studied for a year, that she had tracked through eight other configurations, that she had never quite seen before he became this version of himself.



Her hand moved without permission. Her fingers found his hair, the grey streaks she had catalogued, the texture she now knew better than her own. She touched him gently, a gesture that served no strategic purpose, that gathered no intelligence, that existed only because she wanted to touch him.



He stirred slightly under her hand. Didn't wake. Just shifted, leaning into her touch as if even in sleep his body knew her presence.



Something moved in her chest.



She didn't name it. Didn't try to. The feeling existed beyond the vocabulary she had developed for tracking sensations, beyond the frameworks she had built for understanding her own responses. It was larger than the categories she possessed, and it wasn't asking for permission.



The dawn light touched his face, and she watched him sleep, and her hand remained in his hair, and the question she had refused to finish hummed quietly in the space beneath her ribs:



*Why does proximity feel like—*



Coming home.



But she didn't think the words. Didn't allow them to form.



Some things were too dangerous to name.
