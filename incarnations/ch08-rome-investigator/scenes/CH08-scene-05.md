The streets of Rome were choked with afternoon traffic—carts laden with amphorae, litters bearing the wealthy, slaves carrying burdens that bent their backs toward the cobblestones. Verinus walked quickly, Marcus struggling to keep pace, both of them threading through the chaos toward the praetor's office where a fourth witness had finally agreed to speak.

The cook. Varro's cook, who had been absent the night of the death and had refused every summons until now. She had information, the message said. Something she had remembered.

"Slow down," Marcus called. "The cook will wait."

"The cook has waited three days already. Every hour gives her time to reshape her memory."

"Or to find the courage to tell the truth."

Verinus did not answer. The philosophers' words still echoed in his mind—*honest observers may reach incompatible conclusions*—and he walked faster, as if he could outpace them.

They were crossing the Forum Boarium when the shouting started.

Two men had blocked a narrow passage between market stalls, their argument loud enough to stop traffic in both directions. One was a butcher, his apron stained with blood; the other was a merchant whose cart had apparently damaged the butcher's awning. Their voices rose and fell in the familiar rhythm of Roman commercial dispute—accusations, counter-accusations, threats of legal action that neither man would pursue.

"We can go around," Marcus said.

But the crowd had already thickened, curious citizens pressing close to watch the spectacle. A litter had tipped sideways, blocking the side street. A donkey had taken the opportunity to relieve itself, and its owner was shouting at anyone who came near.

They waited. The argument continued. The sun beat down on the cobblestones, and Verinus felt sweat gathering at his collar.

By the time they reached the praetor's office, the cook was already there—a stout woman in her fifties, her face set in the sour expression of someone who has spent too long waiting and has decided to be angry about it.

"You are late," she said. "I was told the second hour. It is nearly the fourth."

"There was an obstruction in the—"

"I do not care about obstructions. I came to tell you what I know. Now I am not certain I should tell you anything."

Verinus took a breath. "Please. The case requires your testimony."

The cook's eyes narrowed. She was reading him, he realized—measuring his patience, testing his need. Finally she spoke.

"The night before the master died, I was at my sister's house. I left at sunset and did not return until morning. But the night before *that*—three nights before he died—I was in the kitchen. Late. I heard voices."

"The woman," Verinus said. "The neighbor mentioned a woman."

"A woman, yes. Arguing with the master. Then weeping." The cook's voice dropped. "But there is more. I heard the master's voice too. Not angry. Gentle. He was... comforting her. Explaining something. I could not hear the words, but the tone was clear."

"What time was this?"

"After the second watch. Perhaps the third hour of night."

Verinus made a note, then stopped. The third hour of night—that would be roughly nine hours after sunset. But the neighbor had said he heard the woman's voice at the *beginning* of the night, shortly after the evening meal.

"You are certain of the time?"

"I am certain. I had just finished cleaning the braziers. It is always the same hour."

"The neighbor's account says the argument occurred earlier. Before the second watch."

The cook shrugged. "The neighbor is wrong. Or he heard a different argument. I know what I heard and when I heard it."

Verinus stared at his wax tablet. The neighbor's account. The cook's account. Both claimed certainty. Both could not be true.

Unless there had been two arguments. Two visits from the woman. Two opportunities for whatever had passed between her and Varro.

Or unless one of them was mistaken about the time. Or lying. Or remembering a night that had not happened the way they thought it had.

"Thank you," he heard himself say. "You may go."

After the cook left, Marcus leaned against the doorframe. "Well?"

"The timeline is impossible." Verinus began writing, his stylus moving across the wax with deliberate force. "The neighbor says the woman came early in the evening. The cook says she came late at night. Both claim certainty. Both contradict the servant's account, which mentions no woman at all."

"Perhaps the servant did not hear—"

"The servant slept in the back of the house. He said so himself. He could not have heard voices from the study." Verinus looked up. "But if the neighbor heard voices early and the cook heard voices late, then either the woman came twice, or one of them is wrong about the time, or both of them are wrong about everything."

"Or," Marcus said quietly, "they are both telling the truth as they remember it, and memory is not the perfect record you wish it to be."

Verinus's stylus stopped moving.

"Memory is evidence," he said. "It can be tested. Verified. Cross-referenced against other accounts."

"And when the accounts refuse to align?"

"Then one of them is wrong."

"What if none of them are wrong? What if they simply perceived different fragments of the same night, and the fragments do not fit together because reality is not a mosaic waiting to be assembled?"

Verinus stood. The motion was sharp, sudden—the first time he had ever moved in anger toward his friend.

"If reality cannot be assembled," he said, "then justice is impossible. If witnesses cannot be reconciled, then verdicts are arbitrary. If truth is merely fragments—" He stopped, his voice catching. "Then everything I do is meaningless."

Marcus did not step back. His eyes were steady, his voice gentle. "Not meaningless. Different. You are not assembling truth, Verinus. You are choosing which fragments to trust. That is not the same thing, and pretending otherwise does not make it so."

For a long moment, neither of them spoke. The afternoon light slanted through the office window, casting shadows across the wax tablet where Verinus had been writing. The words there were clear, precise, certain.

They were also, he realized, incomplete.

"I need to think," he said.

Marcus nodded. "I know."

He left without another word, and Verinus stood alone in the office, surrounded by scrolls and testimonies and the growing certainty that certainty itself was failing him.

The case would not resolve. The fragments would not align.

And somewhere beneath his ribs, a certainty that had been tightly held for forty years was beginning to loosen.
