The courtyard was quiet in the late afternoon light. A small fountain burbled at its center, the sound soft and continuous, and ivy climbed the walls in patterns that seemed almost deliberate. It was the kind of place where difficult conversations were meant to happen—private, enclosed, far from the noise of the street.

Marcus had returned an hour after their quarrel, saying nothing about what had passed between them. He had simply appeared in the doorway of the praetor's office and said, "There is another witness. A boy. He worked in Varro's kitchen."

Now they sat on stone benches beneath a fig tree, waiting. The boy had been sent for. The boy was, according to the servant Philo, "simple but honest." Whatever that meant.

Verinus cleaned his stylus. The motion had lost its comfort entirely—it was merely habit now, an empty gesture performed by hands that no longer believed in order.

The boy appeared in the archway. He was perhaps fifteen, thin-shouldered and pale, with the uncertain posture of someone who had spent his life trying not to be noticed. His name, Philo had said, was Demetrius. He had been purchased three years ago to help in the kitchen. He had been there the night Varro died.

"Come," Marcus said, his voice warm. "Sit with us."

Demetrius did not sit. He stood at the edge of the courtyard, his hands clasped in front of him, his eyes darting between the two men.

"You are not in trouble," Marcus continued. "We only want to know what you saw."

"I did not see anything." The words came quickly, rehearsed. "I was in the kitchen. I am always in the kitchen."

Verinus leaned forward. "What did you hear?"

The boy's hands twisted together. "Nothing. I heard nothing."

"The cook says she heard voices that night. A woman. The master's voice, gentle. You were in the kitchen with her?"

"No. Yes. I—" Demetrius swallowed. "I do not remember."

"You do not remember whether you were in the kitchen?"

"I was in the kitchen. But I did not hear—I heard—" The boy's voice cracked. "I do not know what I heard."

Verinus felt something rise in his chest—frustration, impatience, the familiar contempt for imprecision. He opened his mouth to speak, and the words that nearly came out were sharp, cutting, designed to slice through the boy's confusion and extract the truth like a surgeon removing a tumor.

He stopped himself. Barely.

Marcus had risen from his bench. He crossed to where Demetrius stood and crouched, bringing himself to the boy's eye level. "You are frightened," he said. "That is all right. Fear does not make you a liar. It makes you human."

Demetrius's eyes filled with tears. "I heard the master that night. I heard him crying."

Verinus went still.

"Crying?" Marcus asked, his voice unchanged.

"After the woman left. I heard her footsteps on the stairs, and then there was silence, and then—" The boy's shoulders began to shake. "He was weeping. The master. I had never heard him weep before. I did not know what to do. I wanted to go to him, but I was afraid. And then it stopped. The weeping stopped. And I thought—I thought perhaps he had fallen asleep."

"What time was this?"

"I do not know. Late. The lamps had burned down. The cook had gone to bed."

"After the third hour of night?"

"I do not know hours. I know lamps. The lamps had burned down. That is all I know."

Verinus watched as Marcus put a hand on the boy's shoulder. The gesture was simple, unremarkable—the kind of comfort that came naturally to some men and not at all to others. Demetrius leaned into it, his body seeming to collapse around that single point of contact.

"You did nothing wrong," Marcus said. "You were a boy in a kitchen, and you heard something that frightened you. That is not a crime."

"I should have gone to him. I should have—"

"You could not have saved him. Whatever happened that night, you could not have changed it."

The boy wept openly now, his face pressed against Marcus's shoulder. And Verinus sat on his bench beneath the fig tree, watching, and felt something shift in his chest that had nothing to do with evidence or testimony or the irreconcilable fragments of truth.

The boy's account was useless. It contradicted nothing because it confirmed nothing. The time was vague, the details impressionistic, the emotional content overwhelming any factual precision.

And yet.

Demetrius had heard Varro weeping. After the woman left. In the deep of the night, when the lamps had burned down and the household slept. A philosopher—a man who had built his life on reason and argument and the careful examination of impressions—had wept alone in his study, and no one had come to him.

That was not evidence. It would not hold up in any tribunal. It told Verinus nothing about how Varro had died or why.

But it told him something about what it meant to die. About the loneliness at the center of even the most examined life. About the gap between what we know and what we feel, and how that gap can swallow a man whole.

Marcus looked up from where he knelt with Demetrius. His eyes met Verinus's across the courtyard.

*Do you see?* the look seemed to say. *This is what I have been trying to tell you.*

Verinus did not answer. He could not.

But when they finally left the courtyard—Demetrius sent back to the kitchen with gentle words and the promise that he would not be questioned again—Verinus walked beside Marcus in silence, and the silence was different than it had been before.

Something had cracked. Something had opened.

He did not yet know what would grow in the space it left behind.
