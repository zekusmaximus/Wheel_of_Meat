Varro's study smelled of old papyrus and lamp oil gone rancid. Scrolls filled every surface—stacked on shelves, piled on the floor, spread across the writing desk where the philosophus had died. The afternoon light came thin through a single high window, catching dust that hung in the air like a held breath. Someone had cleaned the desk since the death, but the wood still bore a dark stain where the wine had spilled, and nothing could remove the sense of interrupted thought that clung to the room.

Verinus stood in the center of the chaos and felt something in his chest constrict.

"Where do you want to begin?" Marcus asked from the doorway.

"With the servant."

They found him in the kitchen, a thin man in his forties whose hands would not stop moving—fingers twisting in the fabric of his tunic, touching his face, reaching for objects and then withdrawing. His name was Philo, and he had been Varro's household slave for eleven years.

"Tell me about that evening," Verinus said.

Philo's eyes darted to the doorway, as if expecting rescue or threat. His hands twisted in the fabric of his tunic—a continuous motion, compulsive, the body betraying what the voice tried to conceal.

Verinus set down his wax tablet. The gesture was small, but it changed the space between them. No longer investigator and evidence. Two men in a room, one frightened, one trying to understand.

"You are not accused," Verinus said quietly. "I am not here to trap you. I am here because a man is dead, and you knew him better than anyone else in this house. Help me see what happened."

Something in Philo's shoulders loosened—not trust, but the faint possibility of it.

"The master retired after the evening meal," Philo said. "His mood was—" He stopped. Swallowed. "His mood was unsettled. He had received a letter that afternoon. I do not know from whom."

"The letter?"

"Gone. He burned it in the brazier. I saw the ashes."

Verinus made a note on his wax tablet. "You said in your written account that his mood was intemperate."

"Did I?" Philo's hands found each other, fingers interlacing and releasing. "Yes. Intemperate. He shouted at the cook over the fish sauce. Small things angered him. But that was not unusual, toward the end."

"The end of what?"

"I don't know. I thought—" The man's voice dropped. "I thought he was ill. He slept poorly. He paced at night. I heard him walking above my quarters, hours after the household was dark."

"Did he have visitors that day?"

"The student came in the morning. Aulus Petronius. They argued."

"About what?"

"Philosophy." Philo said the word as though it were a disease. "They always argued about philosophy. But this time the master sent him away before noon. Said he needed to think."

Verinus waited.

"The neighbor came in the afternoon. Quintus Servilius. He wanted to borrow scrolls. The master refused. Said the scrolls were not for lending anymore."

"Anymore?"

"His word. I do not know what he meant."

"And the woman? Your neighbor mentioned a woman's voice, three nights before the death."

Philo's hands went still. "I heard nothing."

"Nothing?"

"I sleep in the back of the house. My hearing is not—" He trailed off, and Verinus saw the lie settle into his face like water finding its level. Not a malicious lie. A protective one. But protecting whom?

"Thank you," Verinus said. "Send in the student."

Aulus Petronius entered like a man arriving at his own triumph. He was young—perhaps twenty-five—with the polished rhetoric of someone who had studied speech as carefully as thought. He sat without being invited and arranged his toga with deliberate grace.

"A tragedy," he said. "Varro was a brilliant man. Misunderstood, perhaps, but brilliant. His work on the nature of the soul will outlive us all."

"Tell me about your visit that morning."

"We discussed epistemology. The limits of human knowledge." Aulus smiled, a performance of intellectual intimacy. "Varro believed that certainty was possible—that through rigorous reasoning, one could arrive at truth. I disagreed. We debated the point for several hours."

"The servant said you argued."

"We debated. There is a difference." The smile did not waver. "Philosophers disagree. It is how we refine our positions."

"He sent you away before noon."

"He wished to reflect on my arguments. A sign of intellectual humility, I thought. I was pleased."

Marcus shifted in the doorway. Verinus felt his friend's skepticism like heat from a brazier.

"Did Varro seem troubled that morning?"

"Troubled?" Aulus considered the word. "He seemed... engaged. Alive. Not at all like a man contemplating death."

"Yet he died that night."

"Philosophy teaches us that death comes without warning. Even to philosophers."

"Or because of them?"

The smile finally flickered. "What do you mean?"

Verinus did not answer immediately. Something cold had moved through his chest when Aulus spoke of philosophers accepting death—not the words themselves, but the image they conjured. A man choosing principle over breath. The certainty of that choice, absolute and unreachable, held up as virtue.

His hand tightened on the stylus until the bronze bit into his palm. The sensation was wrong, hollow, as if his body remembered something his mind could not access. He forced his grip to loosen.

"Your written account suggests that rivals in the philosophical schools might have 'taken more direct action' against Varro. Do you have evidence of such action?"

"Evidence? No. Suspicion? Let us say that Varro made enemies by being right too often." Aulus rose, smoothing his toga again. "Is there anything else?"

"The woman. Three nights before his death—"

"I know nothing of any woman." The answer came too quickly, and Aulus was already moving toward the door. "I am a student of philosophy, not of Varro's private affairs."

After Aulus left, Marcus remained in the doorway. "You know what he's doing."

"Performing. You said he would." Verinus made a note on his tablet. "His rhetoric is polished, but the content—"

"Is shaped around something he will not name." Marcus crossed to the desk. "Not the death itself. His own role in the argument that morning. He sent Varro into that spiral, and he knows it. That's what he's protecting."

Verinus stopped writing. He had been cataloguing the contradictions in Aulus's account—the too-quick answers, the rehearsed intimacy. He had missed the silence beneath them.

"We return to him last," Verinus said. "After the others have spoken. Let him wonder what we know."

Marcus nodded. "He'll break before you ask the question."

---

Quintus Servilius, the neighbor, was a different creature entirely. He was older than Verinus, with the sour disposition of a man who had expected more from life and blamed everyone else for its failure to arrive. He stood in the doorway of Varro's study, arms crossed, radiating resentment.

"I've already given my account."

"I have questions."

"You have suspicions." Servilius did not move. "The whole city has suspicions. The great Varro, dead under mysterious circumstances. Everyone wants it to be murder. A suicide is too ordinary for a man who thought himself extraordinary."

"You believe it was suicide?"

"I believe he was sick. In spirit, if not in body. A man does not lock himself away from the world unless he wishes to leave it."

"You visited him that afternoon."

"To borrow scrolls. He refused. Said he was done lending. Done teaching. Done—" Servilius's jaw tightened. "Done with everything, I think, though he did not say it."

"And the woman?"

For a moment, something other than resentment crossed the neighbor's face. Fear, perhaps. Or guilt. "I heard voices. Three nights before. A woman's voice, raised. Then silence."

"Could you describe her?"

"I saw nothing. Only heard." Servilius looked past Verinus, toward the stained desk. "Ask the servant. Ask the student. Ask anyone but me. I am only a neighbor. I only heard what I heard."

"Which was?"

"A woman shouting. Then weeping. Then silence." He met Verinus's eyes. "That is all. That is everything. I do not know who she was or why she was here. I do not know what Varro said to make her weep. I know only that three days later, he was dead."

---

After Servilius left, Verinus stood alone in the study. The scrolls surrounded him like witnesses who had forgotten how to speak. Marcus waited in the doorway, watching.

"Well?" Marcus asked.

"The servant lies to protect someone. The student lies to protect himself. The neighbor lies because the truth would cost him something he values." Verinus touched the stained desk, the wood smooth beneath his fingers. "None of them killed Varro. All of them are hiding something."

"Perhaps they are hiding the same thing."

"No. Their silences have different shapes."

Marcus stepped into the room, careful not to disturb the scrolls. "You're trying to build a mosaic from broken tiles. Some pieces will never fit."

"Then I must find new pieces."

"Or accept that the picture is incomplete."

Verinus looked down at the testimonies spread across the stained desk. The servant's fear. The student's performance. The neighbor's resentment. Each account carried its own truth, shaped by perspective and memory and what each witness needed to protect.

He could force them into coherence—select the pieces that fit, discard the rest, build a narrative that satisfied the tribunal. He had done it before. But that would be his truth, not theirs. Not Varro's.

"Perhaps," he said slowly, "the picture is not incomplete. Perhaps it is fractured. Reality itself, not just our accounts of it." The words felt dangerous, but also necessary. "I can hold that. For now."

He turned to face his friend. "A man is dead. His household lies. His student postures. His neighbor trembles at the mention of a woman no one will describe. These are not incompleteness—they are fragments of a truth someone has shattered."

"And if the truth cannot be reassembled?"

"Then I will know it by its absence." Verinus retrieved his stylus, began to clean it. The motion was slower than usual, less certain. "The shape of what is missing tells us what was there."

Marcus watched him for a long moment. "You know what I think?"

"You think I should listen to the emotion beneath the words. You think the servant's fear and the student's pride and the neighbor's guilt are the evidence I'm ignoring."

"Am I wrong?"

Verinus did not answer. Outside, the afternoon light was failing, the dust settling back into the scrolls. Somewhere in this room was the truth of Gaius Quintilius Varro's death—a truth made of fragments and silences and lies that were not quite lies.

He would find it. He would make it coherent.

That was what he did.
