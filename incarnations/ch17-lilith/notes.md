# Chapter 17 - Lilith: Extended Interaction

## Context
Following Chapter 16 (Renaissance Skeptic - France)

## Power Level
**Extended interaction**

## Capabilities
- Can engage in extended interactions and sustained conversations with past incarnations

## Limitations
- Silas does not recognize her across lives
- Cannot reveal her true nature

## Intervention
Appears as philosophical companion encouraging radical doubt

## Objective This Chapter
Feed his doubt. The Renaissance skeptic is already questioning—she appears as a philosophical companion who encourages radical doubt that extends to the spiritual path itself. If he stops believing enlightenment is possible, he stops pursuing it.

## Backfire
Her challenges sharpen his understanding rather than destroying it

## Emotional State
Intellectually engaged; this is a battle of ideas she thinks she can win
