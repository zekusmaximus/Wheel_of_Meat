Morning light pressed against his eyelids.

Silas opened his eyes to a ceiling he recognized—the familiar cracks and shadows of his bedroom in the faculty housing complex, the way the plaster caught the particular grey-gold of Manchester morning through curtains he never fully closed. He was in his bed. He was wearing yesterday's clothes, rumpled and still faintly damp. He had no memory of the drive home.

The clock on his bedside table read 8:47.

He lay still, letting the facts assemble themselves. The rooftop. Stewart. Lilith. The reaching, the absence, three bodies linked. All of it present, immediate, but somehow distant too—information from a night that belonged to a configuration of self that no longer quite applied.

Through the window, he could hear the ordinary sounds of morning: traffic on the street below, students talking as they walked toward campus, a cyclist's bell. The city continuing its patterns. The world unchanged.

But he was not.

His body catalogued its complaints—the bruise across his hip where the barrier had pressed, the rawness of his abraded palms, a general ache in muscles that had strained past their reasonable limits. His phone, extracted from his pocket at some point between the rooftop and here, showed seventeen missed calls and thirty-two unread messages. He silenced it without reading them.

*I am boundless awareness.*

The mantra surfaced automatically, and he watched it rise like a bubble through water. It carried no charge. No urgency. The words were tools he no longer needed to use, a ladder he'd climbed and could now set aside. What the mantra described—boundless awareness, the absence of a fixed observer—wasn't something he needed to achieve anymore. It was simply the texture of his experience, as unremarkable as the ceiling above his head.

He sat up.

The movement felt different. Not in his body—his body moved as it had always moved, subject to the same stiffness and physical memory. But the *one* who moved, the Silas who had always been so firmly located behind his eyes, driving the machine of himself through the world—that one was present only as a kind of playing. A useful fiction he was continuing to inhabit because the world was organized to require such fictions.

The sheets tangled around his legs. He untangled them, swung his feet to the hardwood floor, registered the cold through his socks. His hands braced against the mattress and pushed him upright. Simple actions. Actions that had required no transformation to continue performing. The doing went on; the doer was revealed as optional.

He walked to the window.

The faculty housing complex looked out over a green space between buildings, trees and benches and a path that led toward the main campus. This morning, the green sparkled with the aftermath of the storm—droplets on leaves, puddles in the grass, the particular clean brightness that followed heavy rain. Students moved along the path with the distracted urgency of people who'd overslept.

Silas watched them without the familiar weight of professorial concern. There was a young woman rushing with coffee in one hand and a laptop case in the other. There was a cluster of students arguing about something, their voices too distant to distinguish but their gestures clear. There were all the currents of university life that he'd navigated for years, worrying about grade appeals and curriculum committees and who among these passing figures might be on the edge of something they couldn't handle.

The worry wasn't there.

Not absent the way it would be if he were depressed or empty—he could feel concern rising naturally when he considered their lives, their struggles, the invisible crises they each carried. But the old compulsion was gone. He could care without needing to intervene. He could feel for them without that feeling demanding action.

The absence was strange. Like discovering a roommate who'd always been there had moved out, leaving the apartment quieter but more spacious.

His stomach rumbled. Hunger. Ordinary biological hunger, which had no patience for metaphysical transformation and demanded attention in the usual ways. He found himself smiling at the mundanity of it—the body persisting in its patterns, the world continuing to require participation.

He went to the kitchen.

Coffee. Toast with butter. An apple from the bowl on the counter, its skin slightly wrinkled but still good. He ate standing at the window, watching the morning, and each bite was simultaneously ordinary and subtly luminous—not because the food had changed, but because the one eating had less between himself and the experience of eating.

The seventeen missed calls waited on his silenced phone. The thirty-two messages. The institutional apparatus that would want to process what had happened on the rooftop, file it into categories, determine whether Professor Pahlavan had handled the crisis appropriately or would need to be briefed on better protocols.

He would deal with it. He would answer the calls and attend the meetings and explain in the appropriate register what had happened with Stewart Harrison. The functional self that handled such things was still present, still capable.

But there was no hurry. The morning could continue a while longer. The apple was good. The light was clear. And the self that had been clutching at success, grasping to be the one who saved, had become see-through enough to simply be present, eating breakfast, watching the day unfold.

Somewhere in the city, Lilith was with Stewart. He could feel her absence like a note held after the singer has stopped, a resonance in the space where her presence would have been. They were connected. They had been connected before he understood what connecting meant, and the connection would not dissolve just because they were in separate buildings, separate contexts, separate investigations.

He would see her again. This certainty felt different from the wanting that would normally accompany such knowledge. Not desire, exactly. Not need. Something more like recognition, the way you recognize your own face in a photograph.

For now: toast crumbs on his fingers. Coffee cooling. The green outside the window. And the new texture of his experience, humming quietly where the old urgencies used to live.
