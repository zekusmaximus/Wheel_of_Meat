The paramedics would arrive in minutes. Lilith knew this the way she knew her own breathing. The cadence of emergency response, the distance from the nearest station, the time it took to navigate campus.

Minutes. To become who she needed to be again.

She pulled herself fully upright, brushing rain-damp hair from her face with hands that wouldn't stop shaking. A diagnostician's hands. A psychiatrist's hands. Hands that were supposed to assess, intervene, control. Now they trembled against her thighs like a first-year resident's, betraying what her face refused to admit.

Stewart hadn't moved from his curled position on the concrete. His eyes were open but unfocused, following some internal landscape that had nothing to do with the rooftop around him. Catatonic affect, she cataloged automatically. Dissociative response to trauma. The clinical labels arrived on schedule, slotting the unexplainable into categories that felt thinner than they'd ever felt before.

She'd had her arms around Silas. She'd felt his weight shift forward as he reached over the barrier, felt the moment when gravity should have claimed both of them and somehow hadn't. And in that moment—

No. The professional mode surged, reasserting itself. Later. Parse it later.

But Silas was looking at her, and his eyes held something she couldn't read. Not the professor's careful analysis, not the compassion she'd learned to manipulate. Something simpler and stranger. As if he'd set down a weight he'd been carrying so long that its absence was more visible than its presence had ever been.

"We should move him back from the edge," she said. Her voice came out steadier than her hands. Small victories.

"Yes." Silas didn't move immediately. Just looked at her, that strange open quality still in his face. Then he turned to Stewart, approaching slowly, kneeling beside the young man's curled form. "Stewart? Can you sit up?"

No response. The boy's breathing was shallow but regular,  it was shock, not crisis. Lilith moved to Stewart's other side, her clinical training finally finding purchase. Airway, breathing, circulation. The ABCs of survival, as basic as anything could be.

"We're going to help you sit up," she said in the measured tone she used for patients who'd gone somewhere far from the present. "You don't have to do anything. Just let us move you."

Together, they lifted him. Stewart's body was limp, cooperative, present without being present. They maneuvered him back from the barrier, settling him against the rooftop's central structure where the emergency door opened. Safe distance from the edge. Safe distance from the lights below.

Silas's hands on Stewart's shoulders were different than she expected. No trace of the frantic reaching from moments ago. No trace of the panicked grip. Just hands, doing what needed doing, with a quietness she'd never seen in him before.

The harness was gone. She could see its absence like she could see the absence of a building after demolition—the space it had occupied somehow larger for being empty. The compulsive helping that had driven him onto this rooftop, that had made him leap across the barrier after a falling student, that she'd been counting on to keep him tethered to his patterns—

Gone.

And something had replaced it. Something she couldn't quite name or strategize around.

"Lilith." His voice, her name. She realized she'd been staring.

"I've called for emergency services," she said. Professional mode, armor reassembling. "They'll be here soon. I'll need to accompany him—he's still technically under my care."

Silas nodded. His face held no accusation, no suspicion—just that strange openness, that quality of having arrived somewhere and being present there without needing the arrival to mean anything.

"I'll wait," he said.

She wanted to touch him. The impulse to reach across the space between them rose with physical force. The impulse to make contact, to reassert the connection that had been her primary weapon. But her hands stayed on Stewart's shoulders, and the space between them remained charged and uncrossed.

Below, she could hear sirens beginning their approach.

"What happened?" she asked, and the question carried more than she intended. Not what happened with Stewart. What happened to *you*. What happened to *us*. What was that moment when I grabbed you and the boundaries between everything—

But she couldn't finish the thought, not even internally. The clinical framework wouldn't hold it. The strategic framework wouldn't hold it. Nothing in her considerable arsenal of analysis and manipulation could parse what had passed through her when their three bodies became one system on the edge of the void.

Silas looked at her with those changed eyes.

"I don't know yet," he said. "Something."

The sirens grew louder. The night continued. And between them, the space that had collapsed remained uncertain, neither closed nor open, waiting for what came next.
