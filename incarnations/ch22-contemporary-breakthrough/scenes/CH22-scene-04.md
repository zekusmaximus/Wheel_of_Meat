The door closed behind them, and silence reclaimed the rooftop.

Silas stood where they'd left him, near the barrier but not touching it, his body turned toward the city spread below. The mist had nearly dissolved now, leaving the air clean and cold with the particular clarity that follows heavy rain. Manchester's lights stretched to every horizon—the university buildings, the city center's glow, the distant suburbs fading into darkness.

His phone buzzed in his pocket. He ignored it.

The security officer was gone, redirected to the ground floor to file reports and answer questions that wouldn't capture anything of what had happened here. The rooftop was empty except for Silas and the particular quality of space that lingered after crisis. The wet concrete beneath his feet. The barrier wall with its scratch marks where Stewart's fingers had scraped. The faint hum of the city below, continuing as cities continue, indifferent to the lives that pulse through them.

He should go. He knew this. There would be interviews, meetings, explanations to administrative bodies that operated on the assumption that such events could be explained. Professor intervenes in student crisis. Student retrieved from ledge. Crisis contained.

But his body wasn't ready to move. Something was still settling. It wasn't the adrenaline, which had already begun its gradual recession, but something else. A reconfiguration occurring below the level of conscious awareness, rearranging the furniture in a house he'd lived in without ever noticing what the rooms contained.

*I am boundless awareness.*

The mantra surfaced unbidden, and he examined it from this new vantage. The words were the same words he'd repeated in practice, whispered during lectures, offered to students who asked about contemplative technique. But they sounded different now. Hollow, not with emptiness but with the obviousness of what they were: a description, not a destination. He'd been using the mantra like a map, tracing its contours with his finger, when the territory it described was everywhere he looked.

He tested this again, searching for the familiar weight of it. The compulsion to intervene, to guide, to be the one who made the difference. It had driven him onto this rooftop, had propelled him across the barrier after a falling student. That much was clear. But in the moment of the reaching—

Nothing had been driving. There had been no self at the controls, no one executing the movement. Just the reaching itself, and the absence where the one who reached should have been.

Strange, how the absence could be so tangible. Like discovering a weight you'd carried so long you'd forgotten it was there—and now it was simply gone.

Below, an ambulance departed with lights but no siren, Stewart stable enough for quiet transport, the emergency becoming procedure. Silas watched its red taillights merge with traffic, carrying Lilith and their student and whatever version of events would be told in waiting rooms and hospitals.

Lilith.

Her face on the rooftop, something shifting beneath the composure. Her arms around him, pulling him back from the edge. The moment when her grasping had become indistinguishable from his reaching, when three bodies had operated as a single system of survival.

She'd felt it too. He was as certain of this as he was of his own breathing. In the instant of the chain, the boundary between them had dissolved. Not as metaphor, not as philosophy, but as experienced fact. She had been inside his action the way he had been inside her anchoring. The distinction between rescuer and anchor and rescued had been a convenience of description, not a truth of experience.

And she'd seen something. He'd watched her eyes as the paramedics worked, watched the clinical facade reasserting itself over whatever had broken through. She'd seen something she couldn't unsee, and the professional mode she was wearing was armor against its implications.

What had she seen? The connection? The dissolution? Her own face across all his scattered memories, the dark-haired woman who'd appeared every time the past had bled through today?

He didn't know. Couldn't know, not from here, not from this moment of standing alone on a rooftop that felt less solid than it had an hour ago.

But he would learn. The certainty of this was unprecedented—not driven by the old compulsion to understand so he could fix, but by something simpler. They were connected. They had been connected before tonight, before his scattered memories of other lives, before whatever it was she'd been doing watching him all these months. And the connection would reveal itself, in time, whether either of them pursued it or not.

Doors were opening in his mind. Past lives, he understood now, though the understanding offered no details. Lives he'd lived, lessons he'd learned, deaths that had carried something forward into this moment. They waited like guests arriving for a party, polite and patient, queuing at entrances he hadn't known existed.

He would see them soon. He could feel them gathering.

But for now: the rooftop. The city. The cold air filling his lungs with each breath. And the new baseline of his experience, humming quietly where the old certainties used to live.

He stayed for a few more minutes, letting the settling complete. Then he found the stairwell door and began his descent.
