Lilith wasn't here.

The thought arrived with the flat factuality of morning. She was at the hospital with Stewart, navigating the institutional aftermath of a psychiatric patient's rooftop crisis. Meetings with supervisors. Documentation. The paperwork of crisis contained. She would be busy for hours.

But presence and absence were proving to be more complicated than he'd understood.

Silas could feel her like a low frequency humming through the floor of his awareness. Not in his imagination, not the way you think about someone and conjure their image. This was different. This was sensing, in the way you sense weight or temperature or the quality of light. She was somewhere else in the city, and the somewhere else was also here, connected to where he sat by a thread that had no name but undeniable texture.

What had linked them on the rooftop hadn't dissolved.

He'd felt it form: her arms around him, his arms reaching forward, Stewart's hand finding his. Three bodies, one system. But the physical disentanglement hadn't ended the phenomenon. Whatever had linked them in the moment of crisis remained linked now, stretched across Manchester like a bridge made of something other than matter.

Silas walked into the kitchen, poured himself more coffee, and the routine action didn't diminish the sensing. The mug was warm in his hands, almost too warm, and he held it anyway, letting the heat work into his palms. He was making coffee in his kitchen on a morning after a crisis; he was also maintaining connection with Lilith wherever she was. The hospital's fluorescent halls, a supervisor's office, a room where Stewart waited in post-crisis stabilization. Both things true. Both happening.

It wasn't romantic longing. He tested this thought, examined it from the new clarity the night had given him. Longing required absence to be painful, required the gap between self and other to ache with the need for closing. But the gap wasn't aching. The gap was simply not there.

She was at the hospital. He was in his kitchen. And they were also connected, present to each other across the distance, the way two leaves on the same branch are connected through the branch even when the wind separates their movements.

Old assumptions about separation: he could feel them dissolving the way he'd felt something dissolve on the rooftop. The idea that people were discrete, bounded, located entirely in the bodies they inhabited. It had been useful, that assumption. Society depended on it. But it was also a convenient fiction, a way of parsing something continuous into manageable pieces.

He and Lilith were a single continuity wearing two faces.

The thought arrived without fanfare, and he let it settle without grasping at meaning. Too soon to understand. Too new to parse. But the experience was clear: he could sense her, and the sensing was not imagination, and whatever they were to each other extended beyond the categories that relationships usually occupied.

Lovers, yes. They'd shared that intimacy.

Collaborators of some kind, apparently. Across countless lives, she'd been present at his crises.

Something else, too. Something that exceeded both categories, hinted at by what had happened on the rooftop, confirmed by this quiet morning where her presence threaded through his solitude without violating it.

*What are we?*

The question didn't demand answer. It simply asked, and the asking was enough.

He stood at the window with his coffee, looking out at the green, and the sensing persisted like the hum of blood through his body: present, consistent, a system alive whether or not he attended to it. The glass was cool where his forehead rested against it. She was in the city somewhere, dealing with paperwork and protocols, and she was also threaded through his awareness, present in a way that location couldn't explain.

This was what the lives had been pointing toward. Not just the lessons, not just the deaths, but this: the dissolution of the boundary that made him *him* and her *her*. They weren't merging. They were recognizing that the separation had always been provisional, a convenience of embodiment rather than a truth of being.

For now: coffee, green space, morning light. And the strange new experience of presence without proximity, connection that distance couldn't interrupt.
