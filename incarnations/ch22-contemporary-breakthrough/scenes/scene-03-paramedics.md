The emergency door banged open on floodlights and high-visibility jackets.

Two paramedics came through first, a man and woman in their forties moving with the practiced efficiency of people who'd seen everything and expected worse. Behind them, a campus security officer with a radio crackling questions he couldn't answer.

"Dr. Azami?" The lead paramedic directed the question at Lilith, recognizing her or recognizing the phone call she'd made. "Patient's name?"

"Stewart Harrison. Twenty-one years old. Psychiatric evaluation patient at MRI, absconded earlier this evening." Her voice found its professional register, the words forming themselves with clinical precision. "Initial episode this morning—acute psychological break, grandiose delusions, public disrobing. He was on the edge when we arrived. No direct fall, but significant confusion and dissociative presentation."

The paramedics moved to Stewart, running through their protocols. Blood pressure. Pulse. Pupil response. The young man responded minimally—following the pen light with his eyes, allowing the blood pressure cuff, but offering no words, no resistance, no sign that he understood what was happening.

Silas watched from the periphery, and something strange settled through him. The old Silas would have hovered closer. Would have offered observations, context, the kind of helpful interjections that made him feel useful in crisis. He knew the protocols. He knew the questions to ask. He knew how to make himself indispensable.

But the urge wasn't there. He simply watched—present, attentive, but without the familiar pressure to insert himself into the machinery of rescue. The paramedics knew their work. Stewart was in capable hands. There was nothing Silas needed to add, and the recognition of that was its own kind of relief.

The security officer approached him with a clipboard and a set of questions that couldn't possibly capture what had happened. "Professor Pahlavan? Can you walk me through what you witnessed tonight?"

Silas answered accurately: the rooftop, the student, the moment of reaching. Each word technically true. Each word missing the thing that had actually occurred—the gap, the absence, the dissolution of everything he'd believed himself to be in the instant of action. The officer wrote notes in a cramped hand, checking boxes on a form designed for a world where events could be contained by paperwork.

"Did the student jump, or did he fall?"

"He stumbled. He was turning toward me when he lost his balance."

The officer nodded, satisfied with an answer that fit categories. Silas felt the distance between the documentation and the experience like weather—present, undeniable, impossible to explain to someone who hadn't been inside it.

Lilith was answering her own questions now, her voice carrying the clinical precision that had always been her armor. But he could see the gap in her too—the space between the professional presentation and whatever was churning beneath it. She moved through the protocol efficiently, but her hands hadn't stopped trembling, and once, when she thought no one was watching, she pressed her palm flat against her chest as if checking that something was still there.

The paramedics lifted Stewart onto a stretcher. His eyes drifted toward Lilith as they strapped him in, and for a moment she thought he might speak—might voice whatever he'd been reaching for on the edge, the realization that had taken him past the barrier. But his lips remained closed, and his gaze moved past her, focusing on nothing.

"Dr. Azami, you want to ride along?" The female paramedic gestured toward the door.

"Yes." She should. He was her patient. This was her responsibility. The boundaries of professional obligation clear and containing.

She turned toward Silas.

He was already looking at her. That open face, those eyes that had seen something on the edge of the barrier and been changed by it. The space between them hummed with everything unsaid—the chain, the dissolution, the moment when her grasping had become indistinguishable from his reaching.

She could have spoken. Could have offered some placeholder, some professional closure, some promise to call him later. But the words that rose were all wrong, shaped by strategies that didn't fit anymore, and the silence stretched instead.

Silas raised his hand. Not a wave, not a gesture of farewell—just his palm lifted, held open toward her for a moment. An acknowledgment. A pause in the conversation that was nowhere near finished.

She nodded once.

Then she followed the stretcher through the emergency door, leaving him alone on the rooftop with the thinning mist and the city lights below.
