The emergency door banged open on floodlights and high-visibility jackets.

Two paramedics came through first, a man and woman in their forties moving with the practiced efficiency of people who'd seen everything and expected worse. Behind them, a campus security officer with a radio crackling questions he couldn't answer.

"Dr. Azami?" The lead paramedic directed the question at Lilith, recognizing her or recognizing the phone call she'd made. "Patient's name?"

"Stewart Harrison. Twenty-one years old. Psychiatric evaluation patient at MRI, absconded earlier this evening." Her voice found its professional register, the words forming themselves with clinical precision. "Initial episode this morning—acute psychological break, grandiose delusions, public disrobing. He was on the edge when we arrived. No direct fall, but significant confusion and dissociative presentation."

The paramedics moved to Stewart, running through their protocols. Blood pressure. Pulse. Pupil response. The young man responded minimally—following the pen light with his eyes, allowing the blood pressure cuff, but offering no words, no resistance, no sign that he understood what was happening.

Lilith watched them work and felt the gap between her professional presence and her internal state widening. Here was the clinical frame she knew: patient in crisis, intervention in progress, handoff to emergency services. Standard procedure. Checkboxes she could tick without engaging the parts of herself that were still shaking.

But the parts were still shaking. No protocol for that.

Silas stood apart, near the barrier wall but not too near, his hands at his sides. The security officer approached him, asking questions—Lilith caught fragments, *professor*, *were you here when*, *do you need medical attention*—and Silas answered in that same quiet, open tone she'd heard from him since the chain had formed. As if the questions were arriving from a great distance and he was receiving them without urgency.

The paramedics lifted Stewart onto a stretcher. His eyes drifted toward Lilith as they strapped him in, and for a moment she thought he might speak—might voice whatever he'd been reaching for on the edge, the realization that had taken him past the barrier. But his lips remained closed, and his gaze moved past her, focusing on nothing.

"Dr. Azami, you want to ride along?" The female paramedic gestured toward the door.

"Yes." She should. He was her patient. This was her responsibility. The boundaries of professional obligation clear and containing.

She turned toward Silas.

He was already looking at her. That open face, those eyes that had seen something on the edge of the barrier and been changed by it. The space between them hummed with everything unsaid—the chain, the dissolution, the moment when her grasping had become indistinguishable from his reaching.

She could have spoken. Could have offered some placeholder, some professional closure, some promise to call him later. But the words that rose were all wrong, shaped by strategies that didn't fit anymore, and the silence stretched instead.

Silas raised his hand. Not a wave, not a gesture of farewell—just his palm lifted, held open toward her for a moment. An acknowledgment. A pause in the conversation that was nowhere near finished.

She nodded once.

Then she followed the stretcher through the emergency door, leaving him alone on the rooftop with the thinning mist and the city lights below.
