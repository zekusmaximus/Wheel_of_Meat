## 5. Summary Assessment

**Revision Priority: Moderate**

> **Chapter 22 Summary**: Stream entry chapter. 3 scenes have zero punctuation issues. Scene 6 at 7.9% (critical). Scene 7 HIGH gesture. The thematic content is exceptional—"Their fingers touched," "gap where perceiver vanished," "wheel of meat," "single continuity wearing two faces." This is the novel's climax and reads accordingly.
