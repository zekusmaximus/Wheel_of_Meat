## III

She traced forward.

The thread unspooled through time with a momentum she had not created but had shaped, the betrayal she had influenced now playing out in the inevitable sequence of consequence following cause. Devaka's fear had found expression. The conspirators had been warned. The guards waited in the temple passage while Chandra walked toward a trap his calculating mind had not calculated.

In Manchester, days dissolved. She sat in her tracking corner. The armchair by the window where observation had become something else. She watched the machinery complete its turning. Fresh tea had appeared beside her at some point; she did not remember making it. The steam rose from the mug in thin spirals, untouched, cooling.

Lilith's shoulders settled deeper into the chair. Chandra's investigation proceeded with the efficiency of a man who trusted his methods. She watched him examine grain weights, uncover the substitution scheme, confront the warehouse keeper whose name, Vikram, she filed alongside the other data points. She watched his certainty build like water behind a dam that would not hold.

She could see what he could not.

The pattern was clear from her vantage: Devaka's subtle hesitations, the microscopic tells that should have registered after fifteen years of partnership. The way his hands steadied when they should have trembled. The way his eyes measured distances when they should have held contact. She observed these failures of concealment with clinical precision, noting each one, cataloguing the architecture of a betrayal she had made inevitable.

Chandra noticed some of it. The thread vibrated with his subliminal recognition, the splinter in his thoughts that refused to dislodge. Yet his ledger-mind translated suspicion into alternate hypotheses, found explanations that preserved the trust he had invested. Fifteen years of calculation told him Devaka was loyal; the calculation could not be wrong.

*The numbers have never betrayed me.*

The thought surfaced from his consciousness with such clarity that she felt it in her own chest. The certainty she recognized, the faith in measurement that substituted for knowing. He trusted numbers. He trusted the pattern of partnership that had held for fifteen years.

He did not trust his body when it told him something was wrong.

In Manchester, her hands had tightened on the arms of the chair. Rain had given way to a grey stillness outside her window; how long ago, she could not say. Her tea had developed a skin again. The light through the curtains had shifted toward amber.

The temple passage approached in the thread. Guards emerging from shadows. Devaka's confession: *I had hoped you would stop*. Carrying the weight of betrayal that had been building for weeks, that she had accelerated without announcing her presence.

She leaned into the moment, letting it dominate.

Stone walls pressed close in the torchlight. The smell of incense masked the sharper smell of fear. She saw Chandra's face through his own awareness, reflected in the polished surface of a ceremonial knife. It moved from confusion to comprehension to something she could not name. Something colder than anger, deeper than grief.

*Fifteen years counts for something.*

*It has always meant nothing.*

The words passed between them, and the words were true, and the truth was her doing. She had not created Devaka's fear or his calculating nature or the gap between his loyalty and his survival instinct. She had only pressed on an edge that was already sharp.

The lesson would teach. The betrayal would crystallize understanding she could not articulate but could feel forming in the pattern of his thread. Trust cannot be calculated. Giving cannot depend on reciprocity.

In her flat, her cold hands gripped colder tea, and she watched Chandra's capture with the satisfaction of a calculation completing.

Some part of her registered: *It worked.*

Some part of her did not examine what *worked* meant, or why the satisfaction felt like hunger.
