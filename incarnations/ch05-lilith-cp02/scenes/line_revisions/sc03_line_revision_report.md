## Scene: `CH05-scene-03.md`

## 1. Technical Issues (Punctuation Audit)

| Line | Issue | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| **7** | Em-dash | "she sat in her tracking corner—the armchair by the window" |
| **13** | Em-dash | Pattern noted |
| **25** | Em-dash | Devaka's confession em-dash |
| **29** | Em-dash (2×) | "Stone walls pressed close... the smell of incense—" |

**Total issues: 5** (all em-dash)

### Recommendations

Consider converting 2-3 em-dashes to colons or commas. The scene's observational mode doesn't require the same interruption density as interventions.

## 3. Voice Pattern Compliance

| Pattern | Target | Actual | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Sensory Anchoring | 75% | ~75% | ✓ PASS |

### Loaded Gesture Analysis

**Present examples:**
- L7: "Fresh tea had appeared... The steam rose from the mug in thin spirals, untouched, cooling."
- L23: "her hands had tightened on the arms of the chair"
- L39: "her cold hands gripped colder tea"

**Missing opportunities:**
- L9-11: Chandra's investigation described without Lilith's body reaction
- L15: Observation of Devaka's tells—no physical grounding for Lilith
- L27: "She leaned into the moment"—passive body language

### Suggested Enhancement (L9):

**Current:**
> "Chandra's investigation proceeded with the efficiency of a man who trusted his methods."

**Revised:**
> "Lilith's shoulders settled deeper into the chair. Chandra's investigation proceeded with the efficiency of a man who trusted his methods."

## 4. Priority Line Revisions

### LINE 7: Steam Detail (Preserve)

**Current:**
> "The steam rose from the mug in thin spirals, untouched, cooling."

**Assessment:** Perfect environmental metaphor—spiraling, untouched, cooling mirrors her thread-work. **Do not alter.**

---

### LINE 31-33: Parallel Dialogue

**Current:**
> "*Fifteen years counts for something.*
> *It has always meant nothing.*"

**Assessment:** Devastating. The temporal collapse (counts/has meant) shows knowledge arriving too late. **Preserve exactly.**

---

### LINE 43: Closing Beat

**Current:**
> "Some part of her did not examine what *worked* meant, or why the satisfaction felt like hunger."

**Assessment:** Key fetter beat—refusal to examine. Callbacks to Ka's hunger. **Preserve.**

## 5. Summary Assessment

| Dimension | Rating |
|-----------|--------|
| Voice Consistency | Adequate |
| Technical Polish | Needs Work |
| Thematic Depth | Strong |
| **Revision Priority** | **Moderate** |

### Highest-Impact Revisions
1. Add 3-4 loaded gestures for Lilith during observation
2. Reduce em-dash count by 2
3. Check L27 for stronger physical verb

### Strengths to Preserve
- Tea steam spiraling/cooling
- "satisfaction felt like hunger" closing
- Devaka's confession rendering
