# Editorial Review: The Intervention

## Scene: `CH05-scene-02.md`

---

## Executive Summary

This 50-line pivotal scene marks Lilith's first active intervention. Technically dense (8 punctuation issues) but thematically powerful. Environmental metaphor at 33% needs attention. **Overall revision priority: Moderate**.

---

## 1. Technical Issues (Punctuation Audit)

| Line | Issue | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| **35** | Em-dash (2×) | "She wrenched back to Manchester—her breath coming hard, her hands still gripping..." |
| Multiple | Conjunction starts | 5 instances flagged |

**Total issues: 8** (5 conjunction starts, 3 em-dash)

### Recommendations

Review conjunction starts for intentional rhythm vs. habit. The em-dash in L35 is justified for the violent return.

## 2. Clarity Issues (Pronoun Audit)

**Summary**: 22 total issues

| Category | Count | Priority |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Ambiguous Pronouns | 15 | MEDIUM |
| Pronoun Starts | 5 | LOW |
| Vague Constructions | 1 | LOW |
| Vague Demonstratives | 1 | LOW |

### HIGH-Priority Flag

**Line 23**: "But there was a strangeness"
- *Suggested*: "But strangeness pressed against her" or "But something resisted"

## 3. Voice Pattern Compliance

| Pattern | Target | Actual | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Sensory Anchoring | 75% | ~70% | ✓ PASS |
| Loaded Gesture | 40% | ~35% | ⚠ Borderline |
| Environmental Metaphor | 50% | **33%** | ⚠ BELOW |
| Parallel Construction | 20% | ✓ | ✓ PASS |

### Environmental Metaphor Gap

The scene focuses heavily on interiority (threads, choice-points) with less environmental anchoring than earlier scenes. Rain appears only briefly (L3, L7).

**Suggested enhancement (L13):**
> *Add*: "Outside, the rain had intensified, drumming against glass with a rhythm that matched her quickening pulse."

## 4. Priority Line Revisions

### LINE 11: Key Thematic Beat

**Current:**
> "Her focus had weight. Her attention collapsed probabilities."

**Assessment:** Excellent parallel construction. Core mechanism revealed. **Preserve exactly.**

---

### LINE 27: Physical Grounding

**Current:**
> "Her Manchester hands trembled on the chair arms and her attention trembled at the edge of Devaka's thread..."

**Assessment:** Strong loaded gesture with mirroring. **Preserve.**

---

### LINE 41: Clinical Language

**Current:**
> "*Focused attention appears to affect unresolved choice-points.* The clinical language formed itself automatically. *Mechanism unclear. Effect unintended.*"

**Assessment:** Perfect Lilith voice—documenting while refusing to examine. **Preserve.**

---

### LINE 45: Hunger Introduction

**Current:**
> "Hunger moved in her chest—unfamiliar and unnamed, a new kind of wanting that had nothing to do with the tea she still had not drunk."

**Assessment:** Critical thematic beat—hunger transferring from Ka to Lilith. **Preserve.**

## 5. Summary Assessment

| Dimension | Rating |
|-----------|--------|
| Voice Consistency | Strong |
| Technical Polish | Needs Work |
| Thematic Depth | Exceptional |

### Strengths to Preserve
- "Her focus had weight. Her attention collapsed probabilities."
- The three-heartbeat pause before intervention
- "Participant rather than witness" revelation
