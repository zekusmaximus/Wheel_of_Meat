## Scene: `CH05-scene-01.md`

## Executive Summary

This 36-line opening scene establishes Chandra's thread with strong temporal integration. The ledger/rain overlay is effective. Minor technical issues; voice patterns comply. **Overall revision priority: Minor**.

---

## 1. Technical Issues (Punctuation Audit)

| Line | Issue | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| **7** | Em-dash (2×) | Scene-level density acceptable |
| **25** | Em-dash (2×) | "Her eyes were closed in Manchester... but in the other place—the place between—she observed" |

**Total issues: 3** (em-dash only)

**Assessment:** Em-dash usage is intentional for temporal overlay—consider minor reduction but not critical.

## 2. Clarity Issues (Pronoun Audit)

**Summary**: 15 total issues

| Category | Count | Priority |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Ambiguous Pronouns | 12 | MEDIUM |
| Pronoun Starts | 2 | LOW |
| Vague Constructions | 1 | LOW |

### HIGH-Priority Flag

**Line 9**: 7 named entities with pronouns
- *Context*: Rapid shifts between Lilith, Ka, tea, flat, thread, etc.
- *Assessment*: Intentional for temporal integration—pronouns are anchored by context. **RETAIN**

**Line 27**: "There was a relationship"
- *Suggested*: "A relationship existed" or "A partnership anchored him"

## 3. Voice Pattern Compliance

| Pattern | Target | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Sensory Anchoring | 75% | ✓ PASS |
| Loaded Gesture | 40% | ✓ ~40% |
| Environmental Metaphor | 50% | ✓ Strong |
| Parallel Construction | 20% | ✓ PASS |

**Strong examples:**
- L7: "Rain drummed the window and the warehouse ledgers"
- L13: "fingers closing around ceramic gone cold"
- L17: "precise, controlled, calculating"

## 4. Priority Line Revisions

### LINE 9: Minor Clarity

**Current:**
> "Days had passed since Ka. The prehistoric thread had receded into her awareness like a tide withdrawing, leaving deposits she had yet to fully examined."

**Issue:** "fully examined" should be "fully examine"

**Fix:** Typo correction only.

### LINE 27: Strengthen Opening

**Current:**
> "There was a relationship."

**Suggested:**
> "A relationship anchored him."
