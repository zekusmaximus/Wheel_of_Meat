## IV

The fire burned in Pataliputra.

She watched it through the thread—smoke rising from warehouses, workers fleeing through compound gates, records scattering like frightened birds. Chandra stood at the threshold between two paths, his calculating mind performing its final calculation: evidence or lives, documents or faces, the ledger or the woman who had looked at him with eyes that asked only to be seen.

He chose the records. He chose the burning building. He chose precisely what she would have predicted.

Then a shift.

In the chaos of the fire, in the smoke and screaming and the clarity that catastrophe sometimes granted, she felt the pattern of his consciousness *turn*. Calculation remained—he could never be fully free of that, the numbers were woven too deeply into his framework—but turned toward what the numbers could not hold. The woman with the infant. The elderly worker whose name he had never asked. The faces he had looked away from when looking would have cost him nothing.

He understood. In the moment of choosing wrong, he understood what choosing right would have meant.

The fire took the documents. The fall took his body. Devaka found him in the ash and spoke words that she registered without attending to: *I truly am sorry. It wasn't personal.*

Nothing was personal. Everything was calculation. The satisfaction she had felt when the betrayal crystallized—that had been calculation too. Strategic advantage. The manipulation of variables toward a desired outcome.

*He learned from this.*

The thought formed itself with clinical precision. *The betrayal taught him that giving cannot be transactional. The lesson crystallized.*

In Manchester, hours had passed again. The light through her window had shifted from amber to grey to something approaching dark. Fresh tea sat beside her, untouched, its steam long since dissipated. Her body ached in places she had failed to notice straining—shoulders from gripping the chair, neck from holding still too long, temples from the headache that had not fully released. Her fingers, when she uncurled them from the armrests, left crescents pressed into her palms.

She made herself stand. Her legs protested the motion like wood too long unworked. The flat felt strange around her—too empty, too quiet, too much like the cave where Ka had hoarded meat against a cold that eventually took him anyway.

She did not examine the parallel.

Instead she turned her attention forward, tracing the thread past Chandra's death toward whatever surfaced next. The consciousness she tracked was old, was dense, was building toward something through iteration after iteration. Ka's hoarding had given way to Chandra's ledgers. The next would be different—she could feel the shape of it already, philosophical where these had been visceral and administrative.

Athens. A physician named Philon. Questions that had no answers and a plague that did not discriminate.

The thread hummed forward, alive with the compulsion to help one more, to heal one more, to give until giving became destruction.

*This intervention will work.*

The phrase settled into her like a promise. She filed the hesitation she had felt before influencing Devaka—filed it with the parallel she had not examined, with the hunger she had not named, with all the observations she was making and not attending to.

She leaned toward the next thread.

The flat emptied behind her, and the tea grew cold, and somewhere in the pattern of her own consciousness a knot tightened without her notice.
