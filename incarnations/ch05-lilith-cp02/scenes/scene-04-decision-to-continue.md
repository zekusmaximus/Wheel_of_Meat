The notebook lay open on the kitchen table, her pen hovering above a fresh page.

An hour had passed. The tremors had faded to a fine vibration in her hands. The nausea had settled into something she could ignore. The headache remained, pulsing behind her eyes with each heartbeat, but she had learned to work through worse.

She needed to document what had happened. That was what she did—what she had always done. Fifteen years of her own iterations, catalogued and cross-referenced. Now a new section for others. For the patterns that weren't hers. For the thread she had followed from Ka's frozen cave to Chandra's calculated empire.

For the choice she had not meant to make.

Her pen touched paper.

*March 15. Tracking session: Chandra, continued.*

*Duration: approximately 3 hours. Cognitive cost: severe. focused attention appears to collapse unresolved choice-points; mechanism unclear, effect unintended.*

*Observation: subject's pattern shows significant development from Ka iteration. Sophisticated cognitive structures; systematic approach to resource distribution. Core lesson (giving of self vs. giving of resources) remains incomplete.*

She paused. The clinical language felt like armor—familiar, protective, inadequate to what she was trying to contain.

*Note: during observation of relationship with associate (Devaka), discovered that focused attention appears to affect unresolved choice-points. The mechanism is unclear. The effect was not intended.*

Not intended. She stared at the words. They were true. They were also insufficient.

She had not intended to influence anything. But intention, she was beginning to understand, might not be the relevant variable. She had leaned close to an unresolved choice, and the choice had resolved. She had observed a probability, and the probability had collapsed. Cause and effect, operating across distances of time that should have made causation impossible.

*Further investigation required to determine scope and consistency of effect.*

Her hand had begun to shake again. She set the pen down and pressed her palms flat against the table, waiting for the tremor to pass.

*He'll learn from this.* The thought arrived in her clinical voice, the one she used with patients when reframing their suffering. *If Devaka betrays him, he'll learn that generosity cannot depend on reciprocity. That trust must be given without guarantee of return. The lesson might even accelerate—*

*And if it doesn't?*

The counter-thought surfaced before she could suppress it. What if betrayal didn't teach? What if it only hardened? What if she had just damaged a pattern that had been working toward completion for longer than human civilization had existed?

She closed the notebook. The question didn't need finishing.

The rain had stopped sometime in the past hour. Through the window, she could see the first stars appearing between clouds—pale points of light in the darkness, impossibly distant, impossibly old.

*A fellow traveler.* That was what she had called him, after the first discovery. Someone else doing the work she was doing, following the path she was following, approaching the completion she was approaching. The phrase had felt generous then. Collegial. The recognition of a parallel journey.

It felt different now.

She had reached across time and touched his pattern. Had pressed her attention against a choice that was his to make—or Devaka's to make—and had altered it. Not deliberately. Not maliciously. But altered nonetheless.

*If I can do it once, I can do it again.*

The thought was simple. The implications were not.

She stood and crossed to the window. Her reflection looked back at her from the dark glass—pale, dark-haired, the face she had worn for twenty-six years. Behind the reflection, Manchester's lights blurred through residual rain.

Chandra didn't know she existed. Devaka didn't know why he would choose what he would choose. The pattern unfolded without awareness that it was being observed, being influenced, being shaped by attention that reached across millennia.

And beyond Chandra's thread—she could feel it now, even through exhaustion—another thread waited. The next iteration. Athens. Marble columns and the sound of discourse and a man speaking to students who would someday betray him. The pattern continuing forward, carrying whatever she had just done into whatever came next.

She should stop.

The thought arrived with clarity, with something that might have been conscience. She had crossed a line tonight. Had moved from observer to participant, from witness to actor. The ethical implications alone—

But the thread was there. Humming at the edge of perception. Pulling at something in her that she did not want to name.

*I should stop.*

She turned from the window and looked at the notebook on the table. The documentation of a pursuit that had barely begun. The record of a power she had not known she possessed until tonight.

*I should stop.*

The flat settled into silence around her. The lamp's glow reached just far enough to illuminate the notebook's edge, the pen beside it, the map of Mauryan trade routes on the wall.

She crossed to the table. Opened the notebook to a fresh page. Wrote a single word:

*Athens.*

Then she closed it, extinguished the lamp, and let the darkness take her.

She did not sleep for a long time. When she finally did, she dreamed of threads—Devaka's fear-thread blazing white, Chandra's pattern shuddering with impact, and somewhere ahead in the darkness, another thread waiting, already beginning to brighten under the weight of her attention.
