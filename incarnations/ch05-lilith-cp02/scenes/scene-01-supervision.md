The supervision room smelled of cold coffee and the particular staleness of air that had circulated through too many anxious conversations. March light fell gray through windows streaked with yesterday's rain, illuminating dust motes that drifted without purpose between Lilith and Dr. Harrow's desk.

"Your instincts are developing well." Harrow's pen tapped against the case notes she'd submitted—three new intakes from the past week, each one annotated in her careful hand. "The Okonkwo assessment in particular. You caught the dissociative features that the referring GP missed entirely."

Lilith accepted the observation without letting it settle. Praise from Harrow arrived like English weather: unpredictable, rarely warm, gone before you could properly register it. "The history suggested trauma. The presentation confirmed it."

"Modest." The word carried a slight edge, though whether of approval or suspicion Lilith could not tell. "Modesty will serve you in clinical work. Up to a point."

The radiator clanked its familiar complaint against the March chill. Lilith's clinical badge hung heavy against her chest—the laminated weight of institutional belonging, the photograph already outdated by the six months since she'd begun placement. Her knee had started its low throb, the old injury announcing itself in the damp weather.

"I have a patient this afternoon who might benefit from your perspective." Harrow closed the case file and reached for another. "Gerald Ashworth. Forty-three. Academic. Referred following what his department chair called 'concerning behavior' during a restructuring process."

"Concerning how?"

"Obsessive rumination. Sleep disruption. The usual markers of adjustment disorder, but there's something else underneath." Harrow slid the intake form across the desk. "He's been tracking his colleague's career for the past eight years. Documenting every publication, every committee appointment, every grant. He has spreadsheets."

The word landed with unexpected weight. Lilith kept her face neutral as she scanned the form—age, occupation, presenting complaint—but something in her chest had tightened, a thread pulled taut without warning.

"Spreadsheets," she repeated.

"Meticulous ones, apparently. His wife found them. That's what prompted the referral." Harrow's eyes held the particular sharpness of a supervisor testing a student's limits. "I thought you might find the case instructive."

Lilith nodded, still scanning the intake form. The details blurred slightly—sleep disruption, weight loss, the usual markers of a mind consuming itself.

"One caution." Harrow's voice shifted, carrying something that might have been genuine counsel. "Pattern-recognition is a clinical asset. But be careful you don't start seeing patterns where none exist. Sometimes tracking becomes its own pathology."

The words settled into the room's stale air. Lilith looked up, but Harrow had already turned to the next file, the moment passing as if it had never occurred.
