# Chapter 9, Scene II: Navigating the Review

-----

The review meeting convened in a conference room on the administrative floor—a space designed for precisely this purpose, which meant it was designed to make everyone uncomfortable. Fluorescent panels cast their flat, unforgiving light across a table too large for the four people assembled around it. Lilith sat on one side, her session notes arranged before her. Across from her: Whitmore, Patel, Harrow.

Ten days had passed since the complaint arrived. Ten days of continuing her clinical work while the accusation hung suspended, waiting to be examined. The tracking had remained at the edge of her attention, patient as always. Rome was not going anywhere. Neither was she.

"We've reviewed the documentation from both parties," Whitmore began, her tone carrying the careful neutrality of someone who had conducted dozens of these proceedings. "The purpose of today's meeting is to assess whether Dr. Azami's clinical judgment met the expected standard of care. Dr. Patel will be addressing the ethical dimensions. Dr. Harrow—" she glanced at him briefly "—will be evaluating the therapeutic approach."

Lilith noted Harrow's posture. He sat with his hands folded on the table, his expression the familiar mask of professional skepticism she had learned to read during their supervision sessions. Whatever he was thinking, he was not advertising it.

"Let's begin with the specific allegations." Whitmore opened the folder. "Mr. Crane claims that in your fourth session, you explicitly advised him to—" she read from the document "—'confront his wife about her pattern of emotional neglect and demand she acknowledge the harm she had caused to his sense of purpose.'"

The words hung in the air, bearing no resemblance to anything Lilith had said.

"I have my notes from that session," Lilith said. She slid a page across the table. "The relevant passage is highlighted. What I actually suggested was that he might consider sharing his experience of feeling undervalued—not as an accusation, but as an invitation to dialogue. I framed it as one option among several. I used the phrase 'if he felt ready.'"

Whitmore examined the notes. Passed them to Patel, who read with the particular attention of someone trained to spot ethical fault lines. Passed them finally to Harrow.

Lilith watched him read. His eyes moved across the page with the same methodical precision he brought to everything—the supervision sessions where he questioned her reasoning, the case consultations where he probed for weakness. She expected him to find something. Some gap between what she claimed and what the documentation showed. Some thread he could pull.

He set the page down.

"The notes are consistent with what you've described," he said. "There's no reference to 'confrontation.' No mention of 'emotional neglect.' The framing is exploratory, not prescriptive."

Something shifted in the room. Whitmore's posture relaxed, almost imperceptibly. Patel made a notation.

"Mr. Crane also alleges," Whitmore continued, "that you abandoned him 'mid-crisis' when he was most vulnerable."

Lilith produced another page. "The session log shows that Mr. Crane cancelled three consecutive appointments after our seventh meeting. I sent two follow-up messages offering to reschedule. He did not respond. Our eighth session—the final one—was conducted at his request, two weeks later. He terminated treatment at the end of that session."

Harrow took this page as well. Read it. Set it down with the same deliberate care.

"The timeline contradicts his account," he said. "If anything, the documentation suggests he withdrew from treatment, not the other way around."

Patel spoke for the first time, her voice soft but precise. "Dr. Azami, in your clinical judgment, what was Mr. Crane's primary presenting issue?"

"Displaced ambition," Lilith said. "He had been successful in a previous career and struggled to adapt when his wife's work took precedence. He framed this as his wife's failure to value him, but the clinical picture suggested unprocessed grief about his own professional identity."

"And when you offered the suggestion he's now characterizing as 'dangerous advice'—what was your therapeutic intention?"

"To help him articulate his experience without requiring his wife to validate it. The goal was internal clarity, not external confrontation."

Patel nodded, made another notation. The silence that followed was the silence of a case resolving itself—the evidence pointing clearly in one direction, the formal process simply confirming what the documents had already established.

Harrow cleared his throat.

"I have a question." He leaned forward slightly, and Lilith felt the familiar tension of being examined. "In your seventh session—the one before his cancellations—did anything occur that might have prompted his withdrawal?"

She considered. The seventh session had been difficult. Luther had begun to see, for the first time, the shape of his own resistance. He had not liked what he saw.

"I reflected back a pattern I was observing," she said. "He was rejecting suggestions before he had fully heard them. I named this in a way that was meant to be curious rather than critical. He did not receive it well."

"Did you document that exchange?"

"Yes." She found the relevant page, offered it.

Harrow read. His expression did not change, but something in his attention shifted—a quality of assessment rather than accusation.

"The reflection was appropriate," he said finally. "Perhaps a more experienced clinician might have softened the approach, but the intervention itself was sound. His response appears to be about his own resistance, not your technique."

Lilith absorbed this. Harrow—whom she had categorized, after months of supervision, as someone who would be difficult if given the opportunity—was following the evidence. Not piling on. Not using the complaint as leverage. Simply reading what the documents showed and reporting what he found.

She had filed him incorrectly. Or perhaps she had filed him correctly but incompletely. He was difficult—and he was also fair. The two qualities were not mutually exclusive.

*Interesting,* she thought.

Whitmore gathered the papers. "Unless there are further questions, I believe we have sufficient information to reach a determination."

The panel conferred briefly, their voices low. Lilith sat with her hands folded, her breathing steady, her attention resting on the institutional carpet and the humming fluorescent lights and the particular quality of waiting that came with having done everything correctly and still being required to prove it.

"Dr. Azami." Whitmore's voice brought her back. "The panel finds no evidence of professional misconduct. Your clinical judgment appears to have been sound, and the patient's allegations are not supported by the documentation. The complaint will be dismissed."

Lilith nodded. "Thank you."

She rose, gathered her notes, and walked toward the door. Harrow's voice stopped her.

"Dr. Azami."

She turned. He was still seated, his expression unreadable.

"Your documentation was thorough," he said. "That's what made this straightforward."

It was not an apology for the difficulty of their previous interactions. It was not an acknowledgment that he had misjudged her. It was simply an observation—professional, precise, and unexpectedly generous.

"Thank you, Dr. Harrow," she said.

She walked back through the corridors, past the administrative floor and down the stairs to the clinical wing. The complaint was dismissed. Her judgment had been vindicated. The process had taken time and attention, but it was finished.

And yet something about the pattern lingered. Luther Crane's ill-will—his need to blame, to transfer responsibility, to make someone else the cause of his suffering. Her own response: composed, curious, navigating the injustice without becoming consumed by it.

She had demonstrated what she taught her patients. Responded to accusation without counter-accusation. Faced unfairness without bitterness.

The tracking was waiting. The thread toward Rome hummed at the edge of perception. Soon she would follow it, assess her interventions, plan her next move.

But first: lunch. Then two more patients. Then the accumulated documentation that clinical work required.

The ordinary architecture of a life, continuing its ordinary patterns.
