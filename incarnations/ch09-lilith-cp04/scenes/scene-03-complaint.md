Philosophers were arguing in a portico.

The sound reached her before the image—voices layered like sediment, each assertion complicated by counter-assertion, each certainty undermined by the certainty that followed. She felt Verinus approaching before she saw him, his consciousness pressing toward the debate with the hunger of a man seeking ground that would not shift beneath him.

She let herself sink deeper into the thread.

The Portico of Octavia materialized around her awareness: columns throwing long shadows across marble, afternoon light slanting through the colonnade, citizens and students gathered in clusters to watch two men in philosopher's dress dismantle each other's premises. The crowd had the restless energy of an audience expecting blood—intellectual blood, carefully drawn, but blood nonetheless.

*"We begin with Epictetus,"* the older philosopher was saying. His beard was grey, his voice measured, his certainty absolute. *"The discipline of assent. We must examine our impressions before we judge them true or false."*

*"The question,"* said the younger man—perhaps Verinus's age, built for disagreement—*"is what follows from this discipline. Does careful examination reveal the truth? Or does it reveal that reality itself is fractured—that honest observers, examining the same phenomenon, may arrive at incompatible conclusions?"*

Trembling in Verinus's chest. She felt it as if it were her own—the soft collapse of an assumption long held, the first crack in a structure that had seemed unbreakable.

He was standing at the crowd's edge, arms folded, his stylus clutched in his hand but not cleaned. He had come here seeking clarity. He had come here because the Varro case had offered none. Three witnesses, three accounts, no reconciliation. He needed philosophy to tell him that truth was still possible.

Philosophy was telling him something else.

*"If honest examination yields incompatible conclusions,"* the younger philosopher continued, *"then virtue requires something other than certainty. We must act well despite not knowing, not because we have eliminated doubt."*

The older man's voice rose. *"This is sophistry. If truth is plural, then virtue is arbitrary. We are reduced to animals, groping in darkness."*

*"Or we are elevated to humility."*

The words fell like stones into water, and Lilith felt the ripples spread through Verinus's consciousness—felt them spread through her own. The complaint the philosophers were making was the same complaint she had been making since Ka: reality refuses to behave. Evidence contradicts. Testimony diverges. The things we track do not resolve into the patterns we require of them.

She had come to observe. She had come to watch his certainty tremble.

She was there.

The realization arrived with the weight of physical presence—not the projected observation she had maintained through most of the thread, not the remote perception that cost her headaches and cramped hands, but *being*. Her body in the colonnade. Her lungs breathing marble dust and afternoon heat. Her arms folded in a posture that mirrored his.

Dark-haired. Still. Watching.

She was Marcia Faenia now—the vessel she had chosen for this manifestation, a young woman whose identity mattered less than her presence. She stood at the far edge of the crowd, her attention fixed on Verinus's face as the philosophers contradicted each other, as his worldview trembled, as the investigation he trusted revealed itself to be built on sand.

He saw her.

The moment registered across both frames—his recognition of her stillness, her recognition of his recognition. His eyes found hers through the crowd: observational, measuring, the look of a man cataloguing something he could not yet categorize.

She did not smile. She did not look away. She simply watched, the way she had watched from the thread, the way she had watched since the beginning.

But the watching felt different from inside the portico. Not the clinical distance of observation but the weighted intimacy of presence. She could smell the street vendors' food, feel the stone cool beneath her sandals, hear the quality of his breath when the younger philosopher's words struck home.

*"Consider the testimony of witnesses,"* the younger man was saying. *"Three people observe a death. Each tells a different story. The investigator examines their accounts with perfect discipline. He seeks the point where their stories converge. But what if there is no such point? What if each witness perceived accurately, within the limits of their perception, and the accounts cannot be reconciled because reality itself is already fractured?"*

Verinus's hand tightened on his stylus. She felt his certainty shatter and reform, shatter and reform, the process of a man rebuilding his foundations in real-time.

And she felt—

For a moment, she could not sort which reaction was his and which was hers.

The philosophers argued about whether truth could be singular. She was arguing with herself about whether strategy could be perfected. The frustration in his chest matched the frustration in her chest. The trembling of his worldview matched her own trembling since Ka, since she first recognized in him the patterns she carried herself.

*Which consciousness—*

The thought did not complete. The crowd shifted; someone stepped between them; and when she looked again through Marcia's eyes, Verinus was scanning the colonnade, searching for the dark-haired woman who had been watching him.

She was gone.

Marcia's body still stood at the portico's edge, but the merged sensation had released her, and she was back in Manchester, gasping in her armchair, her hands cold around cold ceramic, her breath coming hard.

The flat reasserted itself: rain, silence, the laptop's patient glow. Her heart was beating too fast. Warmth had settled in her chest that was not satisfaction exactly—that was not anything she could name or file or document.

She had been seen.

He had looked at her—not at Marcia Faenia, not at the vessel she had chosen, but at *her*—and the looking had felt like being known. The philosophers' arguments still echoed: incompatible conclusions, fractured reality, humility elevated. She had observed his certainty trembling and her own certainty had trembled with it.

*Which reaction was his and which was mine?*

The question did not have an answer. She did not want an answer. She closed her eyes, feeling the thread hum forward through time, feeling the investigation continue, feeling Verinus walk out of the portico with something cracked in his framework.

The damage was done. She had not needed to do anything; the philosophers had done it for her. The observation alone had been enough.

But she had not been observing. She had been there. She had felt his eyes find hers.

*I was close enough to touch him.*

The thought surfaced with a strangeness she could not place. It did not feel like strategy. It did not feel like the clinical distance she had maintained through three historical lives.

It felt different—unfamiliar in a way she pressed down immediately, filed with the documentation gaps and the unexamined hunger and all the things she was choosing not to see.

The thread continued. The investigation continued. Verinus's stylus remained uncleaned in his hand, and somewhere in her flat the radiator had stopped ticking, and the boundary between watching and being watched had blurred in a way she would not let herself remember.
