# Scene II: The Seeding

---

The praetor's office smelled of old ink and older ambition. She was inside it now—not observing from distance but pressed against the membrane of the moment, feeling the dust motes hang in morning light, the scrolls packed into honeycombed shelving, the particular weight of accumulated civic anxiety that made the air itself feel documented.

Verinus stood before a table scarred by generations of stylus work. Fresh papyrus lay between him and a freedman whose face had been carved by bureaucratic disappointment into permanent grievance. Somewhere in the back rooms, a clerk was coughing.

She found the cough first.

The sound was small, persistent, the kind of distraction a tired mind might not even register. But she registered it. She traced its source through the office's layered consciousness—past the freedman, past Verinus, to a scribe hunched over his copying work in a room where the light came wrong and the Saturnalia pressure had stretched the hours thin.

The clerk was copying testimonial scrolls. His stylus moved across papyrus with the mechanical precision of exhaustion, transcribing the servant's account of the philosopher's final evening. She could feel the words forming under his hand:

*After the evening meal, his mood intemperate. He shouted at the cook over the fish sauce. Small things angered him.*

Intemperate. The word that would tell Verinus something was wrong. The detail that might lead to questions about what had unsettled the philosopher, what letter he had burned, what woman no one would name.

The cough came again.

In Manchester, a headache bloomed behind her eyes—the cost of proximity, the pressure of attention focused too precisely on too small a target. Her cold hands gripped the edges of her desk, the sensation registering across both frames: her fingers on wood, the clerk's hand hesitating above papyrus as the cough worked through his chest.

She leaned into the hesitation.

Not hard. Not the blazing pressure she had used on Devaka's fear-thread. This was subtler—the weight of attention on a moment already unstable, the focused observation that collapsed probability into outcome. The clerk's hand trembled. His exhausted mind reached for the next word and found—

*Temperate.*

The ink flowed. The meaning inverted. *His mood temperate* where the original said *intemperate*. Calm where there had been agitation. A man at peace where there had been a man unraveling.

The fracture propagated through the document like a crack in ice.

She withdrew from the clerk's awareness before the headache could sharpen into something worse. The Rome-sounds faded—the coughing, the rustle of papyrus, the distant murmur of the freedman explaining the case to Verinus—and Manchester pressed forward: rain against glass, the laptop's glow, her own breath coming harder than it should.

Her hands were steadier than they had been before the intervention.

*This is what precision looks like.* The thought formed with clinical satisfaction. *Not the broad pressure of Philon. Not the heat of Devaka's fear. This is surgical. Microscopic. The smallest possible change with the maximum possible effect.*

She had created two parallel records. The original scroll said *intemperate*; the copy said *temperate*. Every subsequent reading would encounter contradiction. Verinus would notice—his rigid mind would seize on the discrepancy like a splinter—and the doubt would begin.

Doubt was the point.

If she could fracture his certainty early, destabilize the framework he trusted, then when the larger pressures came—the contradictory testimonies, the impossible timelines, the senator's expectations—he would have nothing solid to stand on. A man who could not trust his evidence should trust power. A man who could not find truth should accept convenience.

That was the theory. That was the refinement she had developed since Philon.

The headache pulsed once and began to recede. Her tea had gone cold again—or still, she could not say which. The light through her window suggested afternoon, but afternoon of which day? The documentation gaps had grown.

She opened her laptop, fingers finding keys with the same automatic precision that Verinus's fingers found his stylus. Notes. She needed notes. The clinical language would anchor her, would remind her that this was research, that the hunger in her chest was simply engagement with a problem, that the satisfaction settling into her muscles was the natural reward of precision successfully deployed.

*Focused attention affects unresolved moments. Mechanism requires proximity; cost manifests as physical strain. Intervention successful: parallel testimonial records created. Fracture will propagate.*

The words looked correct on the screen. They captured what had happened without capturing what it felt like to happen it—the intimacy of pressing into someone's hesitation, the strange satisfaction of making a word become something other than what it was.

She did not document the satisfaction. She did not examine why the documentation felt incomplete.

The thread hummed forward, and she followed. Days passed in the investigation—or hours, or weeks, she could not always distinguish—and each new fragment of Verinus's case pressed against her awareness like evidence accumulating toward a verdict she had already written.

The clerk would continue coughing. The freedman would blame poor light and long hours. And somewhere in the praetor's office, two versions of a dead man's mood would wait for a precise investigator to find the fracture she had planted.

*This intervention will work differently,* she told herself. *More precise. More isolated.*

The phrase had a familiar shape. She had thought it before Philon too—believed it, meant it, been wrong about it in ways she still refused to examine. But this time was different. This time she had learned. This time she was not accelerating or isolating or pressuring the consciousness she tracked.

This time she was only seeding doubt.

The distinction felt important. She did not ask why she needed it to feel important. She leaned deeper into the thread instead, feeling for the next pressure point, already certain that precision was the answer.

Her headache had faded entirely. Her hands were steady on the keys. The hunger beneath her sternum had not diminished, but she had learned to ignore it—had filed it with the documentation gaps and the cold tea and all the other observations she was making and not attending to.

Rome waited in the thread. Verinus was reading the contradictory testimonies, his stylus gripped too tight in his hand, his certainty beginning to tremble.

She watched. She waited. She told herself that watching and waiting were enough.
