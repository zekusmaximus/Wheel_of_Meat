The contradictions mounted without her help.

She watched from the thread as testimony piled on testimony: the cook who heard voices at the third hour of night, the neighbor who heard them hours earlier, the servant who claimed to have heard nothing at all. The young kitchen worker who wept in a courtyard and said the philosopher had wept too. Alone in his study, after the woman left, weeping in a way that factual precision could not measure.

Verinus's investigation was collapsing under the weight of truths that refused to cohere.

She could see his mind working against itself. The procedural rigor that demanded reconciliation, the evidence that offered none. He spread the testimonies before him like a man trying to assemble a mosaic from broken tiles, and the tiles would not fit, and his certainty that they *should* fit was itself the obstacle.

*You are not assembling truth,* his friend Marcus told him. *You are choosing which fragments to trust.*

She felt the words land like a blow to his chest, her chest, the distinction increasingly irrelevant. In the flat, her breath caught. The choosing was the problem. The choosing was what she had been doing since Ka: selecting which evidence to weight, which pressure to apply, which fragment of reality to treat as more real than the others.

But the choosing had a purpose. Her choosing had a purpose. She was directing his development, shaping his awakening, correcting the path that would otherwise take too long or go nowhere—

The butcher and the merchant were arguing in the Forum Boarium.

She had triggered it hours ago, or days, or minutes, time moved strangely now. A small nudge in the probability space where commercial resentment lived. The butcher's awning. The merchant's cart. The volume of Roman grievance that could block traffic for longer than rational calculation would suggest.

Verinus was trying to reach the praetor's office. A witness was waiting. The cook, finally willing to speak, carrying information that might reconcile the impossible timeline. Every moment of delay gave her time to reshape memory, gave uncertainty time to erode certainty, gave the investigation one more push toward incoherence.

She watched him stand in the stalled street, Marcus beside him, sweat gathering at his collar. The cook was growing impatient. The testimony she would give would contradict everything that came before, would make the timeline impossible, would force Verinus to choose—

*To choose which fragments to trust.*

The echo came unbidden. She pressed it down.

The cook's testimony was devastating. She claimed to have heard voices at the third hour of night; the neighbor had heard them hours earlier. Both claimed certainty; both could not be true. Verinus's stylus tightened in his grip as he wrote the words, and she felt the fracture propagate through his framework. The same fracture she had seeded with the scribal error, now spreading, now branching, now too complex to reconstruct.

He was breaking. She could feel it.

He would compromise. He was supposed to compromise. The senator—Varro's patron, awaiting a verdict that protected his dignity and would offer a way out. Condemn the servant, preserve the status quo, accept that certainty was unreachable and power was the closest substitute.

That was what men did when their frameworks collapsed. They traded truth for security. They sacrificed the innocent for the convenient. They learned that the world was as dark as she needed him to understand.

The tribunal chamber was smaller than she expected.

She was there now—not Marcia this time, but something less visible, less present, a weight in the air that watched without being watched. The praetor sat at the table's head. The senator's attendants flanked him like reminders of rank. Verinus stood alone with his notes spread before him and his stylus held like a weapon he no longer knew how to use.

*"You have reached a conclusion,"* the praetor said.

*"I have."*

For an instant—she felt it happen.

The verdict forming in his mind. The path of least resistance opening. *Condemn the servant. Restore order. Let procedure be sufficient.* The contradictions she had seeded, the impossible testimonies she had manufactured—they had accumulated into exactly the pressure she intended. His certainty had shattered. His framework had collapsed. And now the cold logic of Roman law offered him the only escape: sacrifice the innocent to preserve the system.

She leaned into that instant. Pressed against it with the weight of her attention. This was what she had engineered—the accumulated impossibilities forcing him toward expedient cruelty. Toward becoming the system. Toward breaking.

His mouth opened to speak—

And then he saw Philo's hands.

White-knuckled on the table's edge. Trembling with the effort of stillness. The physical truth of another person's terror, cutting through the abstraction of verdict and procedure.

The cold certainty cracked. Something warmer moved through the fissure—recognition, humanity, the compassion that had no place in her strategy. The escape route she had not sealed.

The verdict stopped. Reformed. Became something else.

*Closer.*

The word surfaced in her awareness with the precision of a diagnosis. Not failure—calibration. The pressure had nearly worked. The certainty-attachment had nearly tipped into rigid condemnation. She had felt him on the edge of breaking, felt the cold satisfaction of approaching success—

And then compassion had broken through.

*I'm learning what works.*

The thought filed itself with dangerous satisfaction. The approach was correct. The target was correct. The intensity just needed adjustment. Next time, she would anticipate the compassion. Next time, she would seal that crack before it formed.

*Closer.*

His voice was steady now. His certainty remained absent. She could feel the cracks running through every sentence but something else had taken its place. Something she could not name but had just watched emerge.

*"The death of Gaius Quintilius Varro was neither murder nor accident. It was a philosophical act—a final lesson, delivered to himself."*

The senator's jaw tightened. The praetor's face went carefully neutral. And Verinus continued, speaking truth he could not prove, offering interpretation because interpretation was all the evidence allowed.

The servant was legally guilty. Roman law made him so. Responsible for his master's safety, present in the household, unable to account for the night's events. The senator wanted condemnation. The senator expected condemnation. The path of least resistance was clear.

Verinus refused.

*"Philo is guilty only of being human—frightened, confused, unable to comprehend the philosophical torment that consumed his master. If I condemn him, I condemn innocence itself."*

She felt the senator's displeasure shift into something larger, felt it the way she had felt Devaka's fear, the way she had felt the clerk's hesitation. Here was a thread she could pull. Here was a pressure point she could use.

She leaned in.

With precision rather than force, she had learned the value of restraint, steady, focused, weighted. The senator's irritation had been genuine; she only amplified it. The offense had been real; she only sharpened it. The rage that built in Publius Cornelius Scipio exceeded its cause in exactly the way that convincing rage must: disproportionate enough to destroy, measured enough to seem earned.

*"You presume to lecture me on innocence?"* His voice rose. *"You—a functionary, a mere investigator—"*

The words came too loud, too fast. Something had been loosened that could not be contained. In the tribunal chamber, the praetor's face went grey. She was in her flat again her hands gripped the chair arms and she watched the machinery complete its turning.

Verinus was exiled. The sentence came within hours, delivered with the efficiency of Roman political revenge. *Relegatio*—removal from Rome, stranding in some coastal province, the end of everything he had built over forty years of careful service.

The senator meant to break him. She had meant to break him. A man marooned without certainty, without structure, without the investigation that had given his life meaning. Such a man should collapse into cynicism, should learn that virtue was arbitrary and power was the only truth.

*"You cannot save me,"* Verinus said to Marcus in the tribunal's emptied chamber. *"This is the consequence of choosing compassion over convenience."*

She felt the words arrive in her awareness with an impact that was not supposed to happen.

Compassion. He was calling it compassion. He had refused to condemn an innocent man—had lost his career, his home, his city, his friend. Yet he was naming the refusal *compassion*. As if the incoherence did not matter. As if the uncertainty only made the choice more necessary. As if virtue could live where certainty failed.

The thought refused to file.

She tried to document it. Tried to find the clinical language that would reduce it to data but the words would not form. She had broken his certainty. She had fractured his investigation. She had amplified the rage that would exile him from everything stable he had ever known.

And he was calling it compassion.

*"Live well,"* Verinus said. *"That is enough."*

The chamber emptied. Marcus walked away with grief in his spine. Verinus gathered the contradictory testimonies, the impossible timelines, the evidence that remained unresolved and carried them with him toward the exile she had engineered.

She watched him go.

In Manchester, something cold moved through her chest. Her breath had gone shallow in the cold flat. The radiator had stopped ticking. The flat held a silence that felt less like stillness and more like absence—the emptiness of a space where something had been let go.

The radiator clicked once in the flat. He was supposed to break. He was not supposed to choose.

But he had chosen. And the choosing had not looked like breaking.
