# Editorial Review: The Seeding

## Scene: `CH09-scene-02.md`

## Executive Summary

This 70-line scene depicts Lilith's "surgical" intervention—the scribal error. Loaded gesture at 17.1% is critical. The clinical satisfaction is thematically appropriate but body vanishes during the intervention. **Overall revision priority: Major**.

## 3. Voice Pattern Compliance

| Pattern | Target | Actual | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Sensory Anchoring | 75% | ~55% | ⚠ BELOW |
| Loaded Gesture | 40% | **17.1%** | ❌ CRITICAL |
| Environmental Metaphor | 50% | ~40% | ⚠ BORDERLINE |
| Parallel Construction | 20% | ~25% | ✓ PASS |

### ❌ CRITICAL: Loaded Gesture Deficit

Only 3-4 gesture paragraphs in 70 lines:
- L17: "Her cold hands gripped the edges of her desk"
- L29: "her own breath coming harder than it should"
- L31: "Her hands were steadier than they had been"

**Pure interiority (needs gesture):**
- L9-11: Transcription description—no Lilith body
- L33: Clinical satisfaction—internal only
- L45-49: Documentation—no physical cost shown

**Assessment:** The scribal fracture. Clean, precise. **Preserve.**

### LINE 33: Add Physical Satisfaction

**Current:**
> "*This is what precision looks like.* The thought formed with clinical satisfaction."

**Suggested:**
> "The words looked correct on the screen. Her fingers had stilled on the keys. They captured what had happened without capturing what it felt like..."
