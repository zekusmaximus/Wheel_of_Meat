## 3. Voice Pattern Compliance

| Pattern | Target | Actual | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Sensory Anchoring | 75% | ~50% | ⚠ BELOW |
| Loaded Gesture | 40% | **12.8%** | ❌ CRITICAL |
| Environmental Metaphor | 50% | ~35% | ⚠ BELOW |
| Parallel Construction | 20% | ~30% | ✓ PASS |

### ❌ CRITICAL: Gesture and Environment Deficit

**Only 3 gesture paragraphs in 94 lines:**
- L65: "her hands gripped the chair arms"
- L85: "grief in his spine"
- L89: "something cold moved through her chest"

**Pure interiority (needs grounding):**
- L1-27: Investigation collapse—no Manchester anchors
- L35-65: Tribunal scene—Lilith vanishes from flat
- L73-83: Realization—internal processing only

## 4. Priority Line Revisions

### LINE 11: Add Manchester Anchor

**Current:**
> "She felt the words land like a blow to the chest—his chest, her chest, the distinction increasingly irrelevant."

**Suggested:**
> "She felt the words land like a blow to the chest—his chest, her chest, the distinction increasingly irrelevant. In the flat, her breath caught."

---

### LINE 75: Perfect Beat (Preserve)

**Current:**
> "Compassion. He was calling it compassion. He had refused to condemn an innocent man—had lost his career, his home, his city, his friend—and he was naming the refusal *compassion*."

**Assessment:** Backfire crystallizes. **Do not alter.**

---

### LINE 83: Key Echo (Preserve)

**Current:**
> "*Live well,* Verinus said. *That is enough.*"

**Assessment:** Core teaching. **Do not alter.**

---

### LINE 91-93: Closing (Preserve core, add environment)

**Current:**
> "He was supposed to break. He was not supposed to choose.
> But he had chosen. And the choosing had not looked like breaking."

**Suggested addition before:**
> "The radiator clicked once in the cold flat."
