## Executive Summary

This 58-line opening scene transitions from Philon to Verinus with strong sensory differentiation (plague-rot → papyrus). Loaded gesture at 24.1% needs work; the stylus/laptop parallel at closing is excellent. **Overall revision priority: Moderate**.

### Loaded Gesture Analysis

**Strong examples:**
- L15: "His fingers find it automatically... the motion small and rhythmic"
- L25: "her own hand reached for the laptop. The motion was identical"
- L55: "The stylus gleamed... the laptop hummed"

**Missing opportunities:**
- L11: Verinus description lacks Lilith body grounding
- L27-35: Extended observation without Manchester anchor

### LINE 55-57: Perfect Parallel (Preserve)

**Current:**
> "The stylus gleamed in Verinus's hand. In Manchester, the laptop hummed beneath her fingers.
> Both of them were cleaning their tools against a disorder that would not be cleaned."

**Assessment:** Chapter thesis. **Do not alter.**
