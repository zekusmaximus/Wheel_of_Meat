# Editorial Review: The Complaint

## Executive Summary

This 84-line pivotal scene depicts Lilith's physical manifestation (as Marcia Faenia) and the portico philosophers. The "He saw her" moment is charged with consequence. Loaded gesture at 19% needs work; the philosophical debate is well-rendered. **Overall revision priority: Moderate**.

### Loaded Gesture Analysis

**Strong examples:**
- L43: "She could smell the street vendors' food, feel the stone cool beneath her sandals"
- L61: "gasping in her armchair, her hands cold around cold ceramic"
- L47: "Verinus's hand tightened on his stylus"

**Missing opportunities:**
- L25-27: Philosophers arguing—Lilith's body absent
- L49-53: "She felt—" without physical grounding
