# Chapter 9, Scene V: Finding Egypt

-----

The tea cooled in her hands. Manchester's lights blurred through the window, her attention still caught in the residue of the memory-slice.

*Together doesn't hold.*

The phrase circled like something orbiting a gravity well. She did not understand it—not yet. But it had settled into her observations, another data point in the model she was building.

She set down the cup and returned to her tracking corner. The headache had eased; the trembling had stilled. There was more work to do. Verinus's death had shown her the genuine insight, the subtle pride, the seed of vulnerability carrying forward. Now she needed to find where that seed would take root.

She closed her eyes. Let her breathing slow. Reached for the familiar thinning at the edges of consciousness.

The gap between incarnations was always difficult to navigate—that formless space where patterns persisted without persisting, where consciousness existed as potential rather than actuality. She had learned to scan it the way one might scan a horizon, looking for the moment when the thread reformed, when the pattern found its new conditions.

She used her own lives as landmarks. The physician in Alexandria—her consciousness touched that iteration briefly, confirming its position in time. Forward from there. The sutler in Spain. Forward again. The washerwoman in Guangzhou, her hands still carrying the memory of lye and exhaustion.

And there—ahead of where she had been looking, further forward than she had expected—the thread brightened.

Desert. The impression arrived as heat and silence, the quality of light that existed only where civilization had thinned to its barest threads. Sand and rock and sky. A solitude so complete it felt like a presence rather than an absence.

She moved closer, letting the perception sharpen.

A cell carved into rock. A man kneeling in prayer—or what looked like prayer, the posture of supplication held with the rigidity of practice rather than spontaneity. Around him, the spare furnishings of extreme renunciation: a sleeping mat woven from reeds, a clay water jug, baskets he had made himself from materials gathered in the hills. Nothing unnecessary. Nothing comfortable. Nothing that might distract from the work of transcendence.

A Desert Father. One of the hermits who had fled the cities to seek God in the emptiness, to strip away everything that was not essential. She had read about them—fragments surviving in contemporary accounts, the sayings and stories that had shaped early Christianity. But she had not expected to find *him* among them.

She looked closer. Beneath the posture of humility, she found what she was looking for.

The pride was subtle—far subtler than it had been in Verinus. It wore the clothing of virtue, dressed itself in the language of renunciation. But it was there, woven through every gesture of self-denial.

*I have given up more than others. I pray longer than my brothers. My cell is sparser, my fasting more severe. I have achieved what they are still struggling to achieve.*

The satisfaction of being further along. The quiet pleasure of asceticism as accomplishment. Verinus had died proud of having understood; this man lived proud of having surrendered. The content had changed, but the structure remained.

She saw, with the clarity that tracking sometimes provided, exactly how she might work with this.

Direct attack would fail—it had failed with Chandra, with Philon, with Verinus. Every intervention that created suffering seemed to deepen wisdom. Every isolation strengthened rather than broke. The pattern was too resilient for frontal assault.

But what if she didn't attack? What if she *fed* instead?

The strategy formed as she watched him pray. She would not try to corrupt his renunciation—that would only harden it. Instead, she would nurture the pride. Create situations where his spiritual accomplishments were recognized, praised, envied. Let the asceticism become performance. Let the humility curdle into its opposite.

Nuance rather than force. Stalling rather than derailing. Perhaps that was what she had been missing.

She withdrew from the perception, letting the desert fade, the hermit blur back into time. Egypt would wait. The strategy would require planning. And the body she inhabited was making its needs known—hollowness in her stomach, the particular exhaustion that followed extended tracking.

She crossed to the kitchen, found bread and cheese, ate standing at the counter without tasting. The notebooks waited. The documentation could wait until morning.

*Together doesn't hold.*

The phrase surfaced again, unbidden. She did not push it away. Let it rest alongside her other observations: the backfire pattern, the kinship whisper, the strange sense of parallel journeys that had begun with Philon and deepened with Verinus and now included this memory-slice she did not yet understand.

Luther Crane had filed a complaint against her, and she had navigated it without ill-will. Nadia was planning a wedding, and Lilith would attend, would be present, would demonstrate the equanimity that her sister half-admired and half-distrusted. Her professional life continued. Her family life continued. The ordinary architecture of her days remained stable, unremarkable, exactly as it should appear.

And beneath it—always beneath it—the other work continued.

A hermit in Egypt, carrying forward a thread of pride. A strategy forming: nuance rather than force. A question filed but not answered, circling at the edge of awareness like something waiting to be understood.

Lilith turned from the window and moved toward her bedroom. The city slept below, its lights scattered and dimming. The threads hummed at the edge of perception, patient as always.

She did not know—could not yet know—that the question she had filed would grow. That *together doesn't hold* was not an observation but a seed, and that seeds, once planted, did not stop growing simply because one stopped tending them. That the pattern she had glimpsed in that ancient collapse was not an anomaly but a law, and that laws, once intuited, had a way of shaping behavior even before they were understood.

For now, she knew only that she was tired. That Egypt waited. That the work would continue tomorrow, and the day after, and the years after that.

As did his.

As did hers.
