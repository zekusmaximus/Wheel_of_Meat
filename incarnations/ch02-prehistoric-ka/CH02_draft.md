Ka wake to blood taste. Tongue blood. Teeth bite in sleep. Body knows bad coming before mind knows. Cave dark. No light. Air wrong on skin. Wrong smell in nose. Ground remembers feet different now. Used to drink feet in wet season. Now feet stay on top, like walking on frozen water. Wind carries dying grass smell. Fear smell. Wrong bird sound. Neck hair stiff like big hunt time. Belly tight like long hunger time.

Tribe sleep in cave pile. Bodies touch like wolf pups. Safe sounds. Breathing together. Meat dream warm. Strong hunters close. Cave walls weep more water now. Like sky-water stuck in stone. Ka sleep alone near cave mouth. Cave mouth breathes different wind. Used to breathe warm. Now breathes like ice-time. Always alone. Something in Ka's chest. Like ice wall.

Ka think burning makes strong. Ka think alone safe. Eye catches moving. Down in mist valley. Mist like white snake. Shadow shapes run fast. Many shadows. One shadow. Wolf pack shape but wrong. Wrong moving. Sky water used to fall soft like mist-breath. Now falls hard like thrown stones.

New hunters come. Hunters flow together like water drops. Hunt together like hand fingers. Ka chest tightens. Change coming. Smell it wind. Wind changes color of sky. Red wind brings dry time. White wind brings cold time. Feel it ground. Ground shakes into feet into belly. Old hunt ways die like old season prey. Food hard to find. Sweet-root goes deeper in ground now. Must dig past three hand-lengths. Used to be one hand-length. Herds move wrong way. Old hunting grounds empty.

Ka knows better way. Ka hunts alone. Prey blood stays warm shorter time now. Gets stiff-cold fast like frozen stream. Ka stays strong by self. Ka needs no one. Morning birds stop. All stop. Mist valley opens like ripped skin. Ka sees them. New hunters. Strange hunters. Move together. One mind. Herd beasts bunch tighter now. Used to spread like water drops. Now clump like fire sparks. Sky brightens. Dawn red like fresh meat. Ka not know. This dawn test. This dawn end old ways. This dawn end alone time. Or Ka run.


Ka watches cave mouth. Strange hunters in valley. Move like one big animal. Not wolf. Not bear. Not cat. Something new. Fur like night sky after sun goes. Eyes like fire in dark. They hunt. But hunt different. Not like Ka. Not like tribe. Like wolves - strong ones on outside, weak ones inside circle.

They smell ground. Find trail. Big one leads. Back marked with fighting scars. Eyes like ice chunks. Makes throat sounds. Others listen. They move. Like one breath. One heart. Long-tooth cat leaves different marks now. Drags kill higher up rock-places. Follows cold. Elk runs. Young elk. Afraid. Hunters chase. Fast. Quiet.

Ka grips spear. Stick for spear must come from trees that face sun-rise. Other sticks break too easy. Wood feels good in hand. Ka strong. Ka good hunter. But hunters, different. They hunt together. Elk fights. Antlers hit. Hooves kick. No good. Hunters all around. Teeth bite. Claws tear. Elk cries. Falls.

Hunters eat. Blood on fur. Blood on ground. Ka watches. Ka's belly turns. Ka kill before. Many kills. But not like this. This, fast. This, together. One hunter hurt. Small one. Leg cut. Makes hurt sounds. Others eat. Big one stops. Goes to hurt one. Licks hurt leg. Other hunters come. Help hurt one.

Ka not understand. Hunters eat. Hunters help. Together. Always together. Hurt one stands. Walks slow. Others close. They go into trees. Gone. Elk dead. Valley quiet. But quiet different. Like when small-fast-prey dig deeper holes. Means big-cold coming soon. Small-fast-prey knows first.

Ka goes back cave. Dark marks on cave wall dance different when fire moves. Tell new stories. Spear heavy. Sun high. But day feels dark. Ka thinks hunters. Thinks together. Thinks new way. Ka not like new way. But Ka feels. Cold. Like ground getting hard.

Spear drags. Makes small dust clouds. Sky heavy. Like before big storm. Body fur stands up before storm comes. Body knows sky-water coming before eyes know. Ka thinks hunters. Thinks together. Their strange moving as one. New way.

Ka hates new way. Like hating sky-bird stealing meat from Ka's kill. Hates how they move together. Like many-leg beast, all legs moving same time. Fear crawls on Ka's skin. Like crawling bugs. Cold fear sits in Ka's belly. Cold in chest. Like stone where heart should be. Heavy. Dead. Ground hard under Ka's feet. Like earth angry. Holding breath. Waiting to bite.


Cave feels small now. Walls press close. Squeeze breath from Ka. Air thick with tribe smell. Too much. Smell of sweat and fear and too many bodies. Like fur wrap too tight. Other hunters make sleep sounds. Deep sounds. Talk in sleep. Dream of meat and warm. Safe in tribe pile. Ka cannot sleep. Ka sees hunters move as one. Over and over in Ka's head. Like shadows dancing on cave wall. Shows how different they are. How strong. How together. Ka feels small. Like small-fast-prey when sky-bird shadow comes. Weak. Seen. Easy to kill.

Ka pushes fear down deep. Ka big. Ka strong. Words feel empty. Like dead leaves in wind. Cave walls press closer. Tribe smell chokes. Ka needs air. Needs hunt. Needs alone. Away from tribe pile smell. Needs sky above. Wind on face. Hunt alone. Ka leaves cave. No look back. Not want to see tribe body pile. Their touching limbs. Their shared breath sounds.

Tribe noise gone on wind. Like dust blown away. Ka alone. Good. This right. This how Ka should be. Alone under big sky. Under star eyes. Sun lower now. Still hot, but air holds cold promise. Wind whispers. Peace comes. Soft touch on Ka's skin. Sun warm on face. Gazelle smell strong. Fresh. Meat smell. Full belly promise. Good.

Hunt feels right. Chase feels good. Plains quiet. Birds sing morning songs. Sun makes sky colors. Yellow. Blue. Red. Like fire touching clouds. Good. Ka walks low. Like hunting cat. Silent. Watching. Belly to ground. Feel earth under skin. Know earth. Be earth. Feet soft-soft. Leave no marks. See broken grass. Bent low. Shows prey path. Many prey here. Good hunting ground. But wrong. Something wrong. Like when teeth feel storm coming. Ache like after eating ice-cold meat.

Skin prickles. Like ants walking under skin. Warning. Old One words come: "Ground talk. Listen." Ka listens. Closes eyes. Makes self quiet inside. Ground says danger. Low growl deep in earth. Ground says change. Earth moves under feet. Restless. Like sick prey. Birds stop songs. Cut off like broken branch. No sound now. Heavy quiet. Bad quiet.

Ground shakes. Many feet. Not gazelle. Not wind. Hunters. Word forms in Ka's head. Cold fear comes. Ka climbs. Red rock. Must see. Must look from high place. Hands grip rock. Find holds. Strong from many climbs. Many hunts. Many living. Feet push. Strong push. Up. Up. Higher. Above plains. Above trees. Reach top. Wind pulls Ka's hair. Smell sharp now. Smell dry earth and fear. Gazelle fear smell. Plains fear smell. Something else, Smoke smell. Strange bite in nose. Wrong smell.

Ka looks. Eyes search far place. See gazelle herd. Moving fast. Noses up. Tails shake. Afraid. Dark shapes at plain's edge. Coming. Moving toward gazelle. Like dawn hunters. But more. Many more. Like ground insects taking dead prey. Dark wave spreads across plains. Sun sits low. Shadows stretch long. Reach across plain like grabbing hands. Claw at earth. Red light like wounded prey eye. Burns with anger.

Ka remembers before-time. Much water time. Rivers full like fat prey. Lakes overflow like split water skin. Fat herds everywhere. Gazelle thick on plains like flies on meat. Tribe happy then. Faces show teeth in good way. Bellies full of meat. Ka kill big-nose beast. Bigger than any gazelle now. Proud memory. Tribe eat many suns. Old One laugh then. Deep sound like earth sound. Hit Ka's back. Say "Strong hunter." Good words. Warm memory. Time of being part. But other hunters, eyes sharp. Like flint edges. Angry sounds. Like stones hitting Ka's back. "Too good." "Alone." Ka is alone. Good. Ka likes alone.


Tribe like pack dogs. Always fight. Always show teeth. Always want. Never enough. Ka like mountain cat. Quiet. Strong. Alone. Free. But new hunters, together. Why? Question claws Ka's mind like thorn. Together they strong. Like strong vine wrapped many times. Why? Ka pushes thought away. No. Alone is strong. Like lone wolf. But, gazelle, how fast they kill, how all work together, Small doubt grows like winter ice.

Hunters spread out. Like black water on dry ground. Moving stain. Circle gazelle. Tight circle. Closing like trap. No escape place. Hunters share one mind. Kill. Fast. Clean. No waste. Ka watches. Together. Strange power. Scary power. Ka holds spear tight. Feels smooth wood on rough hand. Knows this thing. Good thing. Hunter. Ka kill many. Alone. Always. But hunters make ice grow in Ka's mind. Like cold wind. Make spine shiver. Can Ka live through this new way? This together way?

Wind brings hunter smell. Smoke smell stronger now. But no fire seen. Wrong. Not right. Sky bleeds red. Then black comes. Like rot spreading on meat. Eating light. Hunters eat. Tear meat fast. No waste. Every piece taken. Then move. Not split up. Stay together. As one. Toward red rock. Toward Ka. Ka gets low. Heart beats fast. Like caught bird fighting hand grip. Fear rises. Ka feels fear. Cold knot in belly. Hands shake. Mouth dry like old bone.

Many hunters. Too many. Like stars in sky. Heavy feeling falls on Ka. Like rock slide. Go? Leave? Find new hunting ground? No. Something holds Ka. Not stubborn. Not just want-to-know. Something deeper. Pull like prey pull. Challenge like hunt challenge. Something new. Need to understand fills Ka. Like hunger but different. Ka watches. Learns. Stars burn in dark sky now. Cold bites hard. Makes sweat turn to ice on Ka's skin. Hunters closer. Ka hears them now. Low sounds. Teeth sounds. Throat sounds. They come. Closer. Closer. Their walking sounds like heart beating in Ka's ears. Ka breathes slow. Waits. Watches. Hunters come. Learn or die. Meet, or nothing. Change, or be left behind. Earth whispers truth to Ka. Wind carries message. Old ways die now. Ka must change. Or be left behind. Alone. True alone.

Hunt ground changes. Each sun brings less prey. Good hitting-stone hides under white-ground now. Must remember summer finding-places. Others make scared sounds, point at ice mountains where white never melts now. White ground comes closer each sleep-time. Old trails empty now. Like bones picked clean. Small-fast-prey go first. Then big herd beasts walk away. Now even birds make wrong sounds. Where grass once grew tall like standing hunter, now bends low like sleeping prey. Trees talk more before big wind comes. Leaves shake even when air sleeps.

Wind tastes of strange stone and ice bite. Makes throat dry like after long run. Hurts teeth to breath. Others dig deep for water roots, scrape bark for wet food. Share around night fire. Cubs get first bite now - new thing. Pack changes ways to live. Ka watches from high rocks. Their hands passing food. Their sounds together, like bird flock sounds but deeper. Their hunt marks in dirt showing many spears taking down big prey.

Alpha male still takes first meat, but now shares more. Still, Ka remembers. Remembers spear wound in side from fighting time. Remembers alpha male's teeth showing, others turning away. Remembers sleeping cold, apart. Young hunters look at Ka sometimes. Make come-here movements. Show fresh kill. But joining means giving up own ways. Means being lowest rank again. Means watching cubs while others hunt.

No. Better to find new ground. Better to hunt alone. Sun-warmed stone feels good on tired feet. Red stone here different from old hunt ground. Holds heat longer. Makes good rest place. Stop. Listen. New sounds carry on wind. Like pack songs, but different. Deeper. Stronger. Like many throats making one throat sound. Makes neck hair stiffen.

Others heard these too. Drew warning marks in dirt. Made throat-cutting moves. Pointed to places where strange tracks crossed hunting grounds. Made signs of many hunters becoming prey. Ka follows dry stream bed where water once ran deep enough to swim. Good signs here. Fresh dung still wet inside when broken. Broken grass stems leak white juice - very fresh. Prey passed when sun was at shoulder height. Ground still holds shadow marks of deer feet. Big herd. Good meat.

But other marks in dirt make belly cold. Many marks. Too many. Cross and circle like pack hunts, but wrong shape. New tracks cover old ones. Not random. Makes pattern like hunters use to trap prey against cliff walls. But these hunters different. Leave marks Ka never sees before. Strange smell now. Like pack animal but stronger. Like big cat but different. Musk smell that makes throat want to whimper.

Others spoke of this smell at night fire. Made signs of quick death. No escape. Ka look close in dirt. Reach down feel sand. Not warm. Look up, sun high, should be warm. Dog paws. Tracks wrong. Too close together.

Ka watches hunters go over hill edge. Black shapes against dying sun. Together. Ka feels empty inside. Like after big kill, but no meat. Hollow hurt in belly. Deep hurt that goes past hunger. Hunters come. Learn or die. Old One words beat in Ka's head. Like heart drum. Change, or be left behind. Earth whispers. Ka looks at empty hands. Nothing. No kill. No strong feeling. Just empty.


Ka turns from setting sun. Cold wind bites back. Goes back to cave. Cave smells wrong now. Tribe smell stronger. Fear smell. Change smell. Weak smell. Ka cannot take air in. Too thick. Ka leaves again. Needs air. Needs hunt. Needs alone. Away from pressing tribe smell. Needs big plains. Needs hunt alone. To feel big again. To feel strong again.

Ka waits. No moving. Spear gripped tight. Something watches. Feeling crawls on Ka's skin. No sound. No moving. But Ka knows. Ka looks at trees, dark shadows, twisted branches like grabbing hands. Looks at rocks, sharp edges against dying light. Nothing. But watching feeling stays. Makes skin prickle. Wind changes, brings dog smell again. Stronger now. Closer. Smell like pack animal but stronger. Death smell.

Ka holds spear tighter. Knuckles white like bone. Heart beats like caught bird. Fear sits cold in belly. Then, moving happens. Shadow flickers across stream bed. Now just dust and old stones. Dogs. Not big like wolves. Smaller. Lean-strong. Made for running. Made for killing. Eyes like fire sparks, burning in shadows. Hunters. They move as one, like flowing water stream, like wind through grass, scary-beautiful moving.

Ka watches from rock-hide place. No breathing. Must learn their ways. Must understand new thing. Dogs follow deer trail. Same trail Ka finds. Fresh trail. Good trail. But dogs move different. Not like Ka. Not like tribe. They spread wide, like opened hand. Cover all ground. Silent moving. Only soft paw sounds on dry earth, like whispers in wind. Ka watches. Something like respect grows. They hunt like one mind. One thinking. Kill-skill that makes Ka afraid.

Deer come. Big herd. Not knowing danger. Eating grass. Peaceful like morning time. Ka watches. Spear ready. Good weight feels right. Ka could take one. Maybe two. But dogs wait. Patient like spider. Waiting for strike time. Ka feels new thing. Knows their together-skill. Their waiting-skill.

Dogs attack. Fast like snake strike. Hard like rock fall. Blur of moving. Like storm breaking. Deer run wild. Fear-moving. Dogs too fast. Too many. Cut off escape way. Drive deer toward cliff wall. Death-smart hunting. Ka watches. Mind-struck. Hunters better than Ka. Better than tribe.

Deer trapped now. Cliff behind. Big drop. Dogs make wall in front. Wall of teeth and muscle. Wall of death. Deer fight. Antlers flash like lightning. Hooves hit like thunder. No use fighting. Dogs too many. Too fast. Too together-minded. Deer fall. One. Two. Three. More falling. Bodies hit ground. Dogs eat fast. Smart-eating. No waste. Then gone. Like wind. Like they never were. Ka alone. Spear not used. Nothing done. Empty feeling comes back. Heavier now. Deeper cut.

Ka climbs down. Body feels not-there. Goes to kill place. Sees bodies. Many bodies. More than Ka ever kill alone. Dogs take what they need. Leave rest. Sky birds circle above. Ka feels small. Weak like cub. Hunters change everything. Ka always hunt alone. Always strong alone. Now doubt grows like ice in stream.


Ka thinks about tribe. About sharing food. Hunting together. New ways. Ka always alone. Strong alone. But now alone feels cold. Empty like dry stream. Ka looks at setting sun. Feels wind. Cold wind. Lonely wind. Hears nothing. No birds. No prey. No tribe sounds. Just alone. Word echoes inside. Empty sound. Ka remembers fire warmth. Voice sounds. Even alpha male's rough laugh. Something pulls in chest. Want-feeling?

Ka thinks about dogs. Together-strong. Pack-strong. Ka remembers tribe. Sharing-ways. Helping-ways. Ka remembers alpha male sharing meat. New thing. Breaking of old ways. Or, strength Ka never saw before? Ka remembers young hunters offering food. Kind eyes. Why? Why give good things to Ka who turns away? Ka pushes thoughts down. Alone. Always alone. But ice wall in chest cracks small. Something different grows. Not-sure feeling. Want-to-know feeling. Need feeling. Hunters. Dogs. Tribe. Two different ways. Both live. Both strong. Ka's way, dying?

Ka sits on red stone. Cold comes up through sitting-flesh. Rough stone reminds Ka of alone-time. Watches star-eyes come in big dark. Many stars. Like dogs. Each small. But together, make big light. Watches moon rise. Cold light. Alone light. Not good now. Not strong now. Just, alone. Night air bites cold. Sharp teeth. Carries blood smell. Far-sound of dog howls. Good hunters. Ka, empty-handed. Thought bites deep.

Shadow moves. Close. Not dog. Bigger. Ka's body goes tight. Grips spear. Hunter now? Or, hunted? Thought makes more cold than night wind. Shadow moves again. Closer now. Ka sees eyes. Glow like moon-light. Like dogs but bigger. Cat. Big cat. Hunting. Ka alone.

Dog howls echo. Closer sounds. They hunt. They win. Together. Ka's heart hits like running prey. Cat closer still. Ka could run. Could hide. But, something holds Ka still. Strange quiet feeling. New thought comes. Dogs together. Tribe together. Ka, alone.

Cat makes circle. Low kill-sound. Ka grips spear harder. Alone, Ka weak. Thought comes clear. Sharp like fresh-knapped flint. Understanding breaks like dawn. Ka's way, not strong. Ka's way, dying. Like old hunting grounds. Like dry stream bed.

Smoke smell stronger now. Wrong smell. Something comes. And cat, now. Ka looks at big sky. Cold moon. Alone-time, not strength. Heavy like carrying dead prey. Weak-making. Ka, must change. Thought grows like seed in spring ground. Cat jumps. Ka raises spear. Alone. But new feeling flickers. Not fear. Not pride. Hope-feeling.

Cat moves fast. Muscle. Teeth. Claws. Death comes quick. Ka pushes spear hard. Alone. But spark grows. Not fear. Not pride. Hope. Spear hits. Cat makes pain-sound. Fury-sound. Not deep enough wound. Cat claws strike. Tear Ka's arm open. Deep cut. Blood hot. Pain big. Ka makes sound. Falls down. Cat on top now. Death close like night. Ka smells cat's hot breath. Feels weight pressing down. Crushing Ka. Fear sharp now. Bitter like blood in mouth.

Ka sees tribe running. Coming fast. Making hunt sounds. Spears up. Tribe. Ka never ask help. Never need help. Now, need. Tribe attacks cat. Many spears. Many points biting. Cat fights strong, but tribe stronger. Together. Ka hears grunt sounds. Hunt sounds. Cat sounds. All mix like storm sounds. Cat falls. Dead now. Tribe circles Ka. Alpha male looks down. Not anger face. Not mock face. Worry face? Ka sees it in alpha male's eyes. Something new. Care?

Ka stands. Legs shake like new cub. Arm burns. Blood flows hot-wet. Sticky on skin. World spins like drunk on fire-water berries. Young hunter brings green things. Makes healing wrap. Binds wound. Gentle touch, like mother-touch. Ka smells healing plants. Bitter smell but good smell. Makes pain less. Ka looks at tribe. Together. They save Ka. Ka saved by, tribe. Ka always alone. Strong. Now, not alone. Not strong. But alive. Word sits in Ka's mind. Gift from tribe.


Alpha male points where sun dies. Points to far herd. Big-nose beasts. Dangerous prey. Tribe needs food. Cold time comes. Ka looks at spear. Broken now. No use. Alpha male gives Ka new spear. Strong spear. Sharp point. Wood smooth-cool in Ka's hand. Ka looks at tribe. At big-nose beasts. Together. Ka makes small head move. Small move. Big change.

Tribe hunts. Together. Like dogs. Like water flowing. Around big-nose beast. Making it go where they want. Ka hunts with them. Not alone now. New feeling. Not weak. Not strong. Part of something. Ka learns. Tribe moves as one. Sign-moves. Call-sounds. Hand-talks. Silent speaking. Ka follows. Learns. Watches how they work together. Each hunter doing part. Like strong net with many ties.

Big-nose beast big. Angry. Tusks cut air. Ground shakes. Tribe makes circle. Spears bite. Ka's spear bites with others. Feels power of together-hunting. All-strength. Big-nose beast falls. Mountain of meat and bone. Tribe makes happy sounds. Big sounds. Ka feels, part. Not alone. Warm spreads in Ka's chest. Not like fire. Like sun. Deep warm. Good warm.

Ka eats with tribe. Shares meat. Taste good. Rich taste. Alpha male moves head at Ka. Respect-move. Silent knowing. Ka moves head back. New understanding. Young hunters show teeth in good way. Real warm showing. Ka almost shows teeth back. Small tie-feeling. Fire warm good. Makes pop sounds. Happy sounds. Belly full. Tribe together. Ka, part now. Word sits good in Ka's mind. Right weight.

Night comes big. Star-eyes bright. Many eyes watch from dark place. Moon full-round. Makes long shadows dance. Ka sits by fire. With tribe now. Not alone. Ka watches fire-fingers dance. Orange-red against black night. Hears tribe make song. New song. Together-song. Hunt-song. Tribe-song. Sound-weaving moves through night air like bright fur wrap. Ka closes eyes. Smells smoke. Smells earth. Smells tribe sweat. Not bad smell now. Known smell. Safe smell. Ka feels, peace. Strange new feeling. Good feeling. Ka feels fire warm on face. Hears fire speak-crack. Soft tribe sounds. Drum beats like heart. Night not empty now. Full. Full of life. Full of together. Ka sleeps, not alone. First time, Ka sleeps, with pack. Deep sleep. Good sleep.

New sun breaks earth edge. Sky clear-bright blue. Full of promise like fresh kill. Birds make hope sounds. New start sounds. Ka wakes, not alone. With tribe. Part of pack. New sun. New way. Rising sun makes sky-fire colors. Soft wind moves through grass. Brings wet-earth smell and far-bird calls. Ka stands. Strong now. Ready. Together. Hunt starts. But this time, not just about kill. About tribe. About being part. About being, together. Sky-bird circles high. Makes sharp sound that echoes. Reminds of danger still waiting. But Ka not afraid now. Ka is pack now. Together, they strong.


Cold time comes. Wind cries like hurt prey. White-ground falls soft. Silent like cat-feet. World white now. Like old bones. Cold bites deep. Like wolf teeth in flesh. Hunt hard now. Prey hides. Under white-ground blanket. Tribe hungry. Ka smells hungry on them. Sharp smell. Bad smell. Ka remembers old ways. Hunt alone. Keep all kill. Lone wolf way. Now, Ka hunts with tribe. Together. New way. Ka still strong hunter. But now, Ka shares. Sees cubs shake-cold. Small bodies press close for warm. Breath makes sky-smoke in cold air. Mothers weak now. Faces pulled tight. Eyes empty. Ka gives meat. Feels, good. Warm grows in chest. Not fire warm. Deeper. Sun warm. Feeling spreads. Melts ice around Ka's heart.

Many suns pass. Hunts good. Tribe strong. Cave has much meat. More meat than ever before. Safe feeling. Strong feeling. But something new grows in Ka. Tight chest feeling. Not fear. Not cold. Something else. Want-to-keep feeling. Ka looks at meat pile. Mine. Ka touches meat. Cold-smooth under fingers. Ka starts sleeping near meat pile. Guards like mother guards cubs. Others look at Ka. Not-understanding looks. Question looks. Ka makes throat-warning sound. Others move back. Eyes big with, fear? Respect? Ka not care.

Young hunters come. Ask meat. For cubs. For mothers. Voices small. Eyes begging. Ka stops. Word beats in head. Hard sound. Cold sound. Ka gives small meat piece. Feels, pinch in chest. Bad pinch. Loss feeling. Ka wants more meat. All meat.

White-ground falls harder. Wind-storm makes white-ground dance wild. Wind cries louder. Like dying prey sound. World gets colder. Ice grows on cave walls. Shines in fire-light. Hunts harder now. Tribe tired. Body-weak. Ka hunts. Finds deer. Big deer. Alone. Old hunt-feeling comes back. Ka kills deer. Drags to cave. Heavy like old memories. Hides meat. Mine. Ka eats alone. Away from tribe-eyes. Hides bones. Ka feels good-secret feeling. But also, bad-chest feeling?

Tribe hungry now. Ka sees cubs cry. Small bodies shake with cold-hungry. Mothers weak, eyes like empty holes. Ka feels, chest-pinch. Stronger now. Tight feeling in Ka's chest grows. Like stone. Hard. Cold. Heavy. Ka looks at hidden deer. Mine. Ka eats more. Alone. Takes meat-taste slow. Secret-pleasure.

Then alpha male finds Ka's hidden meat. Eyes burn like fire. Ka shows teeth, ready to fight for meat-pile. Alpha male steps closer. Hand on bone-knife. Challenge-time. Ka feels hot-blood feeling. Fight feeling. Win feeling. But then, Ka sees tribe faces. Hungry cubs. Tired mothers. Ka sees, they need. Chest-tight squeezes hard. Ka stops. But, tribe, Ka looks at alpha male, at hidden deer. Choice-time.

Ka takes deer. Puts on shoulder. Turns back on alpha male. On cave. On tribe. Walks into white-storm. But, alone. Again. Word rides wind-cry. Cold-lonely sound. Ka goes into storm. One shadow eaten by white.

Storm eats Ka. Wind bites like angry wolf. Ground hard like old bone. Each step makes foot-pain. Deer heavy. Dead-weight. Pride gone. Empty inside. Cave gives no help now. Cold takes deep. Inside and out. Meat turns hard as stone. No use now. Wind speaks of tribe. Of warm. Of sharing. Ka alone. Cold. Dying maybe. Wrong choice. Belly hurts. Not hunger-hurt. Deeper hurt. Heart-hurt. Fingers turn black-dead. Life leaving.

Ka's secret meat now hard as rock. Like Ka's black fingers. Others found share-ways, stay-warm ways. Make sleeping circles like cubs. Take turns at fire-edge and fire-heart. But Ka's hidden cave holds only cold. Cold that takes. Never gives. Through cave-mouth, Ka sees smoke rise from tribe-cave below. Not one fire - many small fires join, make big warm. Like stars gathering in night sky. Ka remembers cubs sharing body-warm when sleeping. All breath mixing like smoke. How wolf pack shares kill-meat, even low-rank wolf gets share. How birds share danger-calls, each voice joining others to make big warning.

Everything in world knows sharing way except Ka. Belly pain grows bigger. Not just empty-belly pain. Different pain. Like when Ka see thin cubs below and meat sits heavy in Ka's own belly. Pain spreads like morning ice on water. But inside ice, something moves warm. Like fire-seed hiding in cold ash. Growing warmer with each thin-cub memory.

Ka's mind fills with giving-thoughts now. Like spring flood filling dry streams. See tribe sharing memories. Small one giving water-root to old one. Mother birds feeding chicks. Wolf mother bringing meat in belly, giving to cubs through milk. Even earth gives grass, trees give fruit. Even small-quick-scratchers [rats] share Ka's meat now, taking turns, passing small pieces.

Last warm in Ka's chest feels strange. Not like dying fire. New fire. Like first spark when making flame, but inside. Burning need to know giving. To understand sharing. Hunger for this knowing stronger than belly-hunger. Spreads through Ka's cold body like dawn spreads across sky. Dark comes.

But chest-warm stays. Grows. Burns through dark like star burning through storm clouds. Through cold like spring sun melting ice. Through death like fire-seed waiting in burned ground. Ka's last meat feeds small-quick-scratchers. Ka's last warm feeds wind. Ka's last breath feeds air. Ka's last thoughts feed time-to-come.

Finally learning give-way, too late for this flesh, but time stretches ahead like summer days. Something moves through darkness. Like flame passing flame in night circle. Like mother teaching cub to hunt. Like knowing passing mouth to mouth. Ka's hunger to learn giving pushes through dark, strong as big-nose beast, fast as sky-bird. Searches like hunter seeking prey. Reaches like green vine growing toward sun. Finds new place to grow, new flesh to learn through. New chance to give.

Last small-quick-scratcher sound Ka hears is sharing sound. Last thought Ka thinks is giving thought. Last feeling is burning need to know more, learn more, give more.

Death takes Ka's meat but cannot take Ka's new hunger. Cannot take growing flame.

Ka's next spirit burns toward new life like night-flutter flies to fire.

Ready to learn.

Ready to give.
