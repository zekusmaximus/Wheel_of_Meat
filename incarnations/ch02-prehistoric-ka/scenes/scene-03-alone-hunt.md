Cave feels small now. Walls press close. Squeeze breath from Ka. Air thick with tribe smell. Too much. Smell of sweat and fear and too many bodies. Like fur wrap too tight. Other hunters make sleep sounds. Deep sounds. Talk in sleep. Dream of meat and warm. Safe in tribe pile. Ka cannot sleep. Ka sees hunters move as one. Over and over in Ka's head. Like shadows dancing on cave wall. Shows how different they are. How strong. How together. Ka feels small. Like small-fast-prey when sky-bird shadow comes. Weak. Seen. Easy to kill.

Ka pushes fear down deep. Ka big. Ka strong. Words feel empty. Like dead leaves in wind. Cave walls press closer. Tribe smell chokes. Ka needs air. Needs hunt. Needs alone. Away from tribe pile smell. Needs sky above. Wind on face. Hunt alone. Ka leaves cave. No look back. Not want to see tribe body pile. Their touching limbs. Their shared breath sounds.

Tribe noise gone on wind. Like dust blown away. Ka alone. Good. This right. This how Ka should be. Alone under big sky. Under star eyes. Sun lower now. Still hot, but air holds cold promise. Wind whispers. Peace comes. Soft touch on Ka's skin. Sun warm on face. Gazelle smell strong. Fresh. Meat smell. Full belly promise. Good.

Hunt feels right. Chase feels good. Plains quiet. Birds sing morning songs. Sun makes sky colors. Yellow. Blue. Red. Like fire touching clouds. Good. Ka walks low. Like hunting cat. Silent. Watching. Belly to ground. Feel earth under skin. Know earth. Be earth. Feet soft-soft. Leave no marks. See broken grass. Bent low. Shows prey path. Many prey here. Good hunting ground. But wrong. Something wrong. Like when teeth feel storm coming. Ache like after eating ice-cold meat.

Skin prickles. Like ants walking under skin. Warning. Old One words come: "Ground talk. Listen." Ka listens. Closes eyes. Makes self quiet inside. Ground says danger. Low growl deep in earth. Ground says change. Earth moves under feet. Restless. Like sick prey. Birds stop songs. Cut off like broken branch. No sound now. Heavy quiet. Bad quiet.

Ground shakes. Many feet. Not gazelle. Not wind. Hunters. Word forms in Ka's head. Cold fear comes. Ka climbs. Red rock. Must see. Must look from high place. Hands grip rock. Find holds. Strong from many climbs. Many hunts. Many living. Feet push. Strong push. Up. Up. Higher. Above plains. Above trees. Reach top. Wind pulls Ka's hair. Smell sharp now. Smell dry earth and fear. Gazelle fear smell. Plains fear smell. Something else, Smoke smell. Strange bite in nose. Wrong smell.

Ka looks. Eyes search far place. See gazelle herd. Moving fast. Noses up. Tails shake. Afraid. Dark shapes at plain's edge. Coming. Moving toward gazelle. Like dawn hunters. But more. Many more. Like ground insects taking dead prey. Dark wave spreads across plains. Sun sits low. Shadows stretch long. Reach across plain like grabbing hands. Claw at earth. Red light like wounded prey eye. Burns with anger.

Ka remembers before-time. Much water time. Rivers full like fat prey. Lakes overflow like split water skin. Fat herds everywhere. Gazelle thick on plains like flies on meat. Tribe happy then. Faces show teeth in good way. Bellies full of meat. Ka kill big-nose beast. Bigger than any gazelle now. Proud memory. Tribe eat many suns. Old One laugh then. Deep sound like earth sound. Hit Ka's back. Say "Strong hunter." Good words. Warm memory. Time of being part. But other hunters, eyes sharp. Like flint edges. Angry sounds. Like stones hitting Ka's back. "Too good." "Alone." Ka is alone. Good. Ka likes alone.
