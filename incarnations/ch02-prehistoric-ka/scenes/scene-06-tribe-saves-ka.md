Ka thinks about tribe. About sharing food. Hunting together. New ways. Ka always alone. Strong alone. But now alone feels cold. Empty like dry stream. Ka looks at setting sun. Feels wind. Cold wind. Lonely wind. Hears nothing. No birds. No prey. No tribe sounds. Just alone. Word echoes inside. Empty sound. Ka remembers fire warmth. Voice sounds. Even alpha male's rough laugh. Something pulls in chest. Want-feeling?

Ka thinks about dogs. Together-strong. Pack-strong. Ka remembers tribe. Sharing-ways. Helping-ways. Ka remembers alpha male sharing meat. New thing. Breaking of old ways. Or, strength Ka never saw before? Ka remembers young hunters offering food. Kind eyes. Why? Why give good things to Ka who turns away? Ka pushes thoughts down. Alone. Always alone. But ice wall in chest cracks small. Something different grows. Not-sure feeling. Want-to-know feeling. Need feeling. Hunters. Dogs. Tribe. Two different ways. Both live. Both strong. Ka's way, dying?

Ka sits on red stone. Cold comes up through sitting-flesh. Rough stone reminds Ka of alone-time. Watches star-eyes come in big dark. Many stars. Like dogs. Each small. But together, make big light. Watches moon rise. Cold light. Alone light. Not good now. Not strong now. Just, alone. Night air bites cold. Sharp teeth. Carries blood smell. Far-sound of dog howls. Good hunters. Ka, empty-handed. Thought bites deep.

Shadow moves. Close. Not dog. Bigger. Ka's body goes tight. Grips spear. Hunter now? Or, hunted? Thought makes more cold than night wind. Shadow moves again. Closer now. Ka sees eyes. Glow like moon-light. Like dogs but bigger. Cat. Big cat. Hunting. Ka alone.

Dog howls echo. Closer sounds. They hunt. They win. Together. Ka's heart hits like running prey. Cat closer still. Ka could run. Could hide. But, something holds Ka still. Strange quiet feeling. New thought comes. Dogs together. Tribe together. Ka, alone.

Cat makes circle. Low kill-sound. Ka grips spear harder. Alone, Ka weak. Thought comes clear. Sharp like fresh-knapped flint. Understanding breaks like dawn. Ka's way, not strong. Ka's way, dying. Like old hunting grounds. Like dry stream bed.

Smoke smell stronger now. Wrong smell. Something comes. And cat, now. Ka looks at big sky. Cold moon. Alone-time, not strength. Heavy like carrying dead prey. Weak-making. Ka, must change. Thought grows like seed in spring ground. Cat jumps. Ka raises spear. Alone. But new feeling flickers. Not fear. Not pride. Hope-feeling.

Cat moves fast. Muscle. Teeth. Claws. Death comes quick. Ka pushes spear hard. Alone. But spark grows. Not fear. Not pride. Hope. Spear hits. Cat makes pain-sound. Fury-sound. Not deep enough wound. Cat claws strike. Tear Ka's arm open. Deep cut. Blood hot. Pain big. Ka makes sound. Falls down. Cat on top now. Death close like night. Ka smells cat's hot breath. Feels weight pressing down. Crushing Ka. Fear sharp now. Bitter like blood in mouth.

Ka sees tribe running. Coming fast. Making hunt sounds. Spears up. Tribe. Ka never ask help. Never need help. Now, need. Tribe attacks cat. Many spears. Many points biting. Cat fights strong, but tribe stronger. Together. Ka hears grunt sounds. Hunt sounds. Cat sounds. All mix like storm sounds. Cat falls. Dead now. Tribe circles Ka. Alpha male looks down. Not anger face. Not mock face. Worry face? Ka sees it in alpha male's eyes. Something new. Care?

Ka stands. Legs shake like new cub. Arm burns. Blood flows hot-wet. Sticky on skin. World spins like drunk on fire-water berries. Young hunter brings green things. Makes healing wrap. Binds wound. Gentle touch, like mother-touch. Ka smells healing plants. Bitter smell but good smell. Makes pain less. Ka looks at tribe. Together. They save Ka. Ka saved by, tribe. Ka always alone. Strong. Now, not alone. Not strong. But alive. Word sits in Ka's mind. Gift from tribe.
