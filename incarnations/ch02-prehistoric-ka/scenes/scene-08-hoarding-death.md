Cold time comes. Wind cries like hurt prey. White-ground falls soft. Silent like cat-feet. World white now. Like old bones. Cold bites deep. Like wolf teeth in flesh. Hunt hard now. Prey hides. Under white-ground blanket. Tribe hungry. Ka smells hungry on them. Sharp smell. Bad smell. Ka remembers old ways. Hunt alone. Keep all kill. Lone wolf way. Now, Ka hunts with tribe. Together. New way. Ka still strong hunter. But now, Ka shares. Sees cubs shake-cold. Small bodies press close for warm. Breath makes sky-smoke in cold air. Mothers weak now. Faces pulled tight. Eyes empty. Ka gives meat. Feels, good. Warm grows in chest. Not fire warm. Deeper. Sun warm. Feeling spreads. Melts ice around Ka's heart.

Many suns pass. Hunts good. Tribe strong. Cave has much meat. More meat than ever before. Safe feeling. Strong feeling. But something new grows in Ka. Tight chest feeling. Not fear. Not cold. Something else. Want-to-keep feeling. Ka looks at meat pile. Mine. Ka touches meat. Cold-smooth under fingers. Ka starts sleeping near meat pile. Guards like mother guards cubs. Others look at Ka. Not-understanding looks. Question looks. Ka makes throat-warning sound. Others move back. Eyes big with, fear? Respect? Ka not care.

Young hunters come. Ask meat. For cubs. For mothers. Voices small. Eyes begging. Ka stops. Word beats in head. Hard sound. Cold sound. Ka gives small meat piece. Feels, pinch in chest. Bad pinch. Loss feeling. Ka wants more meat. All meat.

White-ground falls harder. Wind-storm makes white-ground dance wild. Wind cries louder. Like dying prey sound. World gets colder. Ice grows on cave walls. Shines in fire-light. Hunts harder now. Tribe tired. Body-weak. Ka hunts. Finds deer. Big deer. Alone. Old hunt-feeling comes back. Ka kills deer. Drags to cave. Heavy like old memories. Hides meat. Mine. Ka eats alone. Away from tribe-eyes. Hides bones. Ka feels good-secret feeling. But also, bad-chest feeling?

Tribe hungry now. Ka sees cubs cry. Small bodies shake with cold-hungry. Mothers weak, eyes like empty holes. Ka feels, chest-pinch. Stronger now. Tight feeling in Ka's chest grows. Like stone. Hard. Cold. Heavy. Ka looks at hidden deer. Mine. Ka eats more. Alone. Takes meat-taste slow. Secret-pleasure.

Then alpha male finds Ka's hidden meat. Eyes burn like fire. Ka shows teeth, ready to fight for meat-pile. Alpha male steps closer. Hand on bone-knife. Challenge-time. Ka feels hot-blood feeling. Fight feeling. Win feeling. But then, Ka sees tribe faces. Hungry cubs. Tired mothers. Ka sees, they need. Chest-tight squeezes hard. Ka stops. But, tribe, Ka looks at alpha male, at hidden deer. Choice-time.

Ka takes deer. Puts on shoulder. Turns back on alpha male. On cave. On tribe. Walks into white-storm. But, alone. Again. Word rides wind-cry. Cold-lonely sound. Ka goes into storm. One shadow eaten by white.

Storm eats Ka. Wind bites like angry wolf. Ground hard like old bone. Each step makes foot-pain. Deer heavy. Dead-weight. Pride gone. Empty inside. Cave gives no help now. Cold takes deep. Inside and out. Meat turns hard as stone. No use now. Wind speaks of tribe. Of warm. Of sharing. Ka alone. Cold. Dying maybe. Wrong choice. Belly hurts. Not hunger-hurt. Deeper hurt. Heart-hurt. Fingers turn black-dead. Life leaving.

Ka's secret meat now hard as rock. Like Ka's black fingers. Others found share-ways, stay-warm ways. Make sleeping circles like cubs. Take turns at fire-edge and fire-heart. But Ka's hidden cave holds only cold. Cold that takes. Never gives. Through cave-mouth, Ka sees smoke rise from tribe-cave below. Not one fire - many small fires join, make big warm. Like stars gathering in night sky. Ka remembers cubs sharing body-warm when sleeping. All breath mixing like smoke. How wolf pack shares kill-meat, even low-rank wolf gets share. How birds share danger-calls, each voice joining others to make big warning.

Everything in world knows sharing way except Ka. Belly pain grows bigger. Not just empty-belly pain. Different pain. Like when Ka see thin cubs below and meat sits heavy in Ka's own belly. Pain spreads like morning ice on water. But inside ice, something moves warm. Like fire-seed hiding in cold ash. Growing warmer with each thin-cub memory.

Ka's mind fills with giving-thoughts now. Like spring flood filling dry streams. See tribe sharing memories. Small one giving water-root to old one. Mother birds feeding chicks. Wolf mother bringing meat in belly, giving to cubs through milk. Even earth gives grass, trees give fruit. Even small-quick-scratchers [rats] share Ka's meat now, taking turns, passing small pieces.

Last warm in Ka's chest feels strange. Not like dying fire. New fire. Like first spark when making flame, but inside. Burning need to know giving. To understand sharing. Hunger for this knowing stronger than belly-hunger. Spreads through Ka's cold body like dawn spreads across sky. Dark comes.

But chest-warm stays. Grows. Burns through dark like star burning through storm clouds. Through cold like spring sun melting ice. Through death like fire-seed waiting in burned ground. Ka's last meat feeds small-quick-scratchers. Ka's last warm feeds wind. Ka's last breath feeds air. Ka's last thoughts feed time-to-come.

Finally learning give-way, too late for this flesh, but time stretches ahead like summer days. Something moves through darkness. Like flame passing flame in night circle. Like mother teaching cub to hunt. Like knowing passing mouth to mouth. Ka's hunger to learn giving pushes through dark, strong as big-nose beast, fast as sky-bird. Searches like hunter seeking prey. Reaches like green vine growing toward sun. Finds new place to grow, new flesh to learn through. New chance to give.

Last small-quick-scratcher sound Ka hears is sharing sound. Last thought Ka thinks is giving thought. Last feeling is burning need to know more, learn more, give more.

Death takes Ka's meat but cannot take Ka's new hunger. Cannot take growing flame.

Ka's next spirit burns toward new life like night-flutter flies to fire.

Ready to learn.

Ready to give.
