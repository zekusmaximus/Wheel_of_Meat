Ka watches cave mouth. Strange hunters in valley. Move like one big animal. Not wolf. Not bear. Not cat. Something new. Fur like night sky after sun goes. Eyes like fire in dark. They hunt. But hunt different. Not like Ka. Not like tribe. Like wolves - strong ones on outside, weak ones inside circle.

They smell ground. Find trail. Big one leads. Back marked with fighting scars. Eyes like ice chunks. Makes throat sounds. Others listen. They move. Like one breath. One heart. Long-tooth cat leaves different marks now. Drags kill higher up rock-places. Follows cold. Elk runs. Young elk. Afraid. Hunters chase. Fast. Quiet.

Ka grips spear. Stick for spear must come from trees that face sun-rise. Other sticks break too easy. Wood feels good in hand. Ka strong. Ka good hunter. But hunters, different. They hunt together. Elk fights. Antlers hit. Hooves kick. No good. Hunters all around. Teeth bite. Claws tear. Elk cries. Falls.

Hunters eat. Blood on fur. Blood on ground. Ka watches. Ka's belly turns. Ka kill before. Many kills. But not like this. This, fast. This, together. One hunter hurt. Small one. Leg cut. Makes hurt sounds. Others eat. Big one stops. Goes to hurt one. Licks hurt leg. Other hunters come. Help hurt one.

Ka not understand. Hunters eat. Hunters help. Together. Always together. Hurt one stands. Walks slow. Others close. They go into trees. Gone. Elk dead. Valley quiet. But quiet different. Like when small-fast-prey dig deeper holes. Means big-cold coming soon. Small-fast-prey knows first.

Ka goes back cave. Dark marks on cave wall dance different when fire moves. Tell new stories. Spear heavy. Sun high. But day feels dark. Ka thinks hunters. Thinks together. Thinks new way. Ka not like new way. But Ka feels. Cold. Like ground getting hard.

Spear drags. Makes small dust clouds. Sky heavy. Like before big storm. Body fur stands up before storm comes. Body knows sky-water coming before eyes know. Ka thinks hunters. Thinks together. Their strange moving as one. New way.

Ka hates new way. Like hating sky-bird stealing meat from Ka's kill. Hates how they move together. Like many-leg beast, all legs moving same time. Fear crawls on Ka's skin. Like crawling bugs. Cold fear sits in Ka's belly. Cold in chest. Like stone where heart should be. Heavy. Dead. Ground hard under Ka's feet. Like earth angry. Holding breath. Waiting to bite.
