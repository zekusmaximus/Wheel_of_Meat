Tribe like pack dogs. Always fight. Always show teeth. Always want. Never enough. Ka like mountain cat. Quiet. Strong. Alone. Free. But new hunters, together. Why? Question claws Ka's mind like thorn. Together they strong. Like strong vine wrapped many times. Why? Ka pushes thought away. No. Alone is strong. Like lone wolf. But, gazelle, how fast they kill, how all work together, Small doubt grows like winter ice.

Hunters spread out. Like black water on dry ground. Moving stain. Circle gazelle. Tight circle. Closing like trap. No escape place. Hunters share one mind. Kill. Fast. Clean. No waste. Ka watches. Together. Strange power. Scary power. Ka holds spear tight. Feels smooth wood on rough hand. Knows this thing. Good thing. Hunter. Ka kill many. Alone. Always. But hunters make ice grow in Ka's mind. Like cold wind. Make spine shiver. Can Ka live through this new way? This together way?

Wind brings hunter smell. Smoke smell stronger now. But no fire seen. Wrong. Not right. Sky bleeds red. Then black comes. Like rot spreading on meat. Eating light. Hunters eat. Tear meat fast. No waste. Every piece taken. Then move. Not split up. Stay together. As one. Toward red rock. Toward Ka. Ka gets low. Heart beats fast. Like caught bird fighting hand grip. Fear rises. Ka feels fear. Cold knot in belly. Hands shake. Mouth dry like old bone.

Many hunters. Too many. Like stars in sky. Heavy feeling falls on Ka. Like rock slide. Go? Leave? Find new hunting ground? No. Something holds Ka. Not stubborn. Not just want-to-know. Something deeper. Pull like prey pull. Challenge like hunt challenge. Something new. Need to understand fills Ka. Like hunger but different. Ka watches. Learns. Stars burn in dark sky now. Cold bites hard. Makes sweat turn to ice on Ka's skin. Hunters closer. Ka hears them now. Low sounds. Teeth sounds. Throat sounds. They come. Closer. Closer. Their walking sounds like heart beating in Ka's ears. Ka breathes slow. Waits. Watches. Hunters come. Learn or die. Meet, or nothing. Change, or be left behind. Earth whispers truth to Ka. Wind carries message. Old ways die now. Ka must change. Or be left behind. Alone. True alone.

Hunt ground changes. Each sun brings less prey. Good hitting-stone hides under white-ground now. Must remember summer finding-places. Others make scared sounds, point at ice mountains where white never melts now. White ground comes closer each sleep-time. Old trails empty now. Like bones picked clean. Small-fast-prey go first. Then big herd beasts walk away. Now even birds make wrong sounds. Where grass once grew tall like standing hunter, now bends low like sleeping prey. Trees talk more before big wind comes. Leaves shake even when air sleeps.

Wind tastes of strange stone and ice bite. Makes throat dry like after long run. Hurts teeth to breath. Others dig deep for water roots, scrape bark for wet food. Share around night fire. Cubs get first bite now - new thing. Pack changes ways to live. Ka watches from high rocks. Their hands passing food. Their sounds together, like bird flock sounds but deeper. Their hunt marks in dirt showing many spears taking down big prey.

Alpha male still takes first meat, but now shares more. Still, Ka remembers. Remembers spear wound in side from fighting time. Remembers alpha male's teeth showing, others turning away. Remembers sleeping cold, apart. Young hunters look at Ka sometimes. Make come-here movements. Show fresh kill. But joining means giving up own ways. Means being lowest rank again. Means watching cubs while others hunt.

No. Better to find new ground. Better to hunt alone. Sun-warmed stone feels good on tired feet. Red stone here different from old hunt ground. Holds heat longer. Makes good rest place. Stop. Listen. New sounds carry on wind. Like pack songs, but different. Deeper. Stronger. Like many throats making one throat sound. Makes neck hair stiffen.

Others heard these too. Drew warning marks in dirt. Made throat-cutting moves. Pointed to places where strange tracks crossed hunting grounds. Made signs of many hunters becoming prey. Ka follows dry stream bed where water once ran deep enough to swim. Good signs here. Fresh dung still wet inside when broken. Broken grass stems leak white juice - very fresh. Prey passed when sun was at shoulder height. Ground still holds shadow marks of deer feet. Big herd. Good meat.

But other marks in dirt make belly cold. Many marks. Too many. Cross and circle like pack hunts, but wrong shape. New tracks cover old ones. Not random. Makes pattern like hunters use to trap prey against cliff walls. But these hunters different. Leave marks Ka never sees before. Strange smell now. Like pack animal but stronger. Like big cat but different. Musk smell that makes throat want to whimper.

Others spoke of this smell at night fire. Made signs of quick death. No escape. Ka look close in dirt. Reach down feel sand. Not warm. Look up, sun high, should be warm. Dog paws. Tracks wrong. Too close together.

Ka watches hunters go over hill edge. Black shapes against dying sun. Together. Ka feels empty inside. Like after big kill, but no meat. Hollow hurt in belly. Deep hurt that goes past hunger. Hunters come. Learn or die. Old One words beat in Ka's head. Like heart drum. Change, or be left behind. Earth whispers. Ka looks at empty hands. Nothing. No kill. No strong feeling. Just empty.
