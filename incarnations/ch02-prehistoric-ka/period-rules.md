# Period Rules: Chapter 2 - Blood

## Historical Setting

- **Period**: Prehistoric - Early Homo sapiens
- **Location**: Jebel Irhoud, Morocco
- **Year**: Approximately 300,000 BCE
- **Climate Context**: Transitional period—warming/cooling shifts affecting prey migration, water sources, vegetation. The "white-ground" (snow/ice) is encroaching on previously temperate zones.

## Genre: Survival Horror/Action

### Genre Conventions to Honor

- Visceral immediacy—the body under threat
- Environmental hostility as antagonist
- Pack dynamics (the new hunters/dogs) as both threat and model
- Survival as the stakes of every scene
- Horror through the alien (hunters who move "like one mind")

### Genre Elements Present in Draft

- The cat attack as survival horror set piece
- The dog pack hunt as awe-inspiring/terrifying demonstration
- Environmental pressure (cold, diminishing prey) as slow-building threat
- Isolation horror—Ka alone against forces that require cooperation

---

## Linguistic Constraints

### Vocabulary Rules

**Permitted:**
- Concrete nouns (body parts, animals, elements, tools)
- Sensory verbs (smell, taste, feel, hear, see—but rendered as direct experience)
- Action verbs (hunt, run, kill, eat, sleep, give, take)
- Simple relational words (like, but, and, not, with)

**Forbidden:**
- Abstract nouns (love, fear, hope, pride, doubt)—must be rendered through body sensation
- Complex temporal markers (before, after, during)—use simple sequencing
- Psychological vocabulary (think, believe, understand, realize)—use "know" sparingly, prefer body-knowing
- Any word Ka's consciousness couldn't form

### Kenning-Like Compounds

Create names for things Ka's language wouldn't have words for:

| Concept | Ka's Term |
|---------|-----------|
| Rats/rodents | small-quick-scratchers |
| Mammoth/elephant | big-nose beast |
| Snow | white-ground |
| Stars | star-eyes |
| Flames | fire-fingers |
| Eagle/vulture | sky-bird |
| Rain | sky-water |
| Moon | cold light / alone light |
| Smoke | [no compound—Ka knows smoke] |

Add new compounds as needed, maintaining the [adjective]-[noun] or [noun]-[noun] pattern.

### Sentence Structure

**Preferred patterns:**
- Simple declarative: "Ka hunts. Ka kills."
- Fragment for emphasis: "Alone. Always alone."
- Paratactic accumulation: "Wind bites. Cold takes. Ground hard."
- Complicating juxtaposition: "Ka strong. Ka good hunter. But hunters, different."

**Forbidden patterns:**
- Subordinate clauses ("When Ka saw the hunters, he felt...")
- Complex conditionals ("If Ka had known...")
- Passive voice ("Ka was attacked by...")
- Periodic sentences (delay of main clause)

### Rendering Abstract Concepts

Every abstraction must become physical sensation:

| Abstract Concept | Physical Rendering |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Fear | "Cold knot in belly" / "Cold fear sits in Ka's belly" |
| Loneliness | "Like stone where heart should be. Heavy. Dead." |
| Understanding | "Sharp like fresh-knapped flint" |
| Hope | "Like fire-seed hiding in cold ash" |
| Pride | "Chest big" / "Stands tall" |
| Shame | "Eyes down" / "Body small" |
| Love/connection | "Warm grows in chest. Not fire warm. Deeper. Sun warm." |
| Spiritual insight | "New fire. Like first spark when making flame, but inside." |

## The Body-Thought Technique

Ka's consciousness doesn't separate thought from sensation. Internal states are felt, not analyzed:

> "Body knows bad coming before mind knows."
> "Ground says danger. Low growl deep in earth."
> "Thought bites deep." (Thought as physical attack)

When Ka "thinks," render it as:
- Body sensation interpreting environment
- Memory as sensory replay
- Decision as body-readiness

---

## Environmental Integration

Ka doesn't observe the environment—Ka IS part of it. The boundary between self and world is porous:

> "Makes self quiet inside. Ground says danger."
> "Feet soft-soft. Leave no marks. See broken grass. Bent low. Shows prey path."

### Observation-as-Omen

Ka reads environment as prophetic text:

> "Small-fast-prey dig deeper holes. Means big-cold coming soon."
> "Trees talk more before big wind comes. Leaves shake even when air sleeps."
> "Birds stop songs. Cut off like broken branch. No sound now. Heavy quiet. Bad quiet."

Every environmental detail carries meaning. Nothing is mere setting.

## Ka - Avatar Profile

### Identity
- **Name**: Ka (simple, primal—possibly meaning "self" or "spirit")
- **Role**: Hunter, initially solitary
- **Status**: Early soul development—learning the first lesson of cooperation

### The Compulsive Helper (Proto-Form)

In Ka, the helper-instinct is undeveloped/suppressed. Ka's arc moves TOWARD helping, not struggling with attachment to helping. This is the soul's earliest encounter with the choice between isolation and connection.

Ka begins believing:
> "Ka think burning makes strong. Ka think alone safe."

Ka ends understanding (incompletely):
> "Finally learning give-way, too late for this flesh"

### Physical Markers

[To be finalized—should persist across incarnations:]
- A gesture when uncertain/observing
- Something about the eyes ("Eye catches moving")
- Body positioning when making decisions

### Behavioral Markers

Ka's patience and observation persist into Silas's academic temperament:
> "Ka watches. Learns."
> "Must learn their ways. Must understand new thing."

The watching-to-understand quality carries through all incarnations.

## Lilith in This Chapter

### Power Level
First accidental influence through meditation—observing from future, minimal intervention. She cannot physically manifest.

### Possible Presence (Subtle)

Readers who know to look might find her in:
- The strange smoke smell that appears repeatedly ("Smoke smell stronger now. But no fire seen. Wrong.")
- The "something watches" sensation Ka feels
- Any moment of inexplicable hesitation or environmental strangeness

**Important:** Her presence should remain ambiguous in this chapter. She's observing, possibly influencing through the environment, but not consciously intervening yet.

### Objective This Chapter
None yet—this is when she first becomes aware of Silas's soul. She observes Ka and realizes this consciousness is accumulating merit at an alarming rate.

## The Lesson: Cooperation and Social Bonds

### Arc Structure

1. **Opening state**: Ka alone, believing isolation is strength
2. **Catalyst**: Observes pack hunters (dogs) and their together-power
3. **Resistance**: Ka rejects the lesson, maintains isolation
4. **Crisis**: Cat attack—saved by tribe
5. **Integration**: Ka joins tribe, hunts together, experiences warmth
6. **Regression**: Hoards meat, returns to isolation
7. **Consequence**: Dies alone in cold
8. **Death-insight**: Finally understands giving, but too late for this life

### What Ka Learns
The necessity of cooperation. Alone is not strength—together is strength.

### What Ka Fails to Learn
HOW to give—not just resources but self. Ka's final hoarding shows the lesson is intellectual but not embodied. The "burning need to know giving" is desire, not actualization.

### Death Seeds Next Lesson
Ka dies with hunger to understand giving. Chandra (Chapter 3) will have the resources to give but will give resources, not self. The incomplete lesson evolves but remains incomplete.

---

## Thematic Requirements

### Meat/Body Theme

Central to this chapter. Manifestations:
- Hunting and eating meat as survival
- The pack hunters' efficient meat-consumption
- Ka's hoarded meat as attachment
- "Death takes Ka's meat but cannot take Ka's new hunger"
- The body as "meat" that dies while something persists

### The Ice Wall / Chest Stone

Ka's isolation manifests physically. Track its evolution:
- "Something in Ka's chest. Like ice wall."
- "Like stone where heart should be. Heavy. Dead."
- "Ice wall in chest cracks small" (when tribe saves Ka)
- "Warm grows in Ka's chest. Not like fire. Like sun. Deep warm." (joining tribe)
- Returns to cold when Ka hoards and isolates

### Together vs. Alone

The central opposition. Dogs/pack hunters represent the together-way:
> "They hunt like one mind. One thinking."
> "Like strong net with many ties."

Ka represents the alone-way that must die:
> "Ka's way, not strong. Ka's way, dying. Like old hunting grounds. Like dry stream bed."

---

## Scene Requirements

Every scene should:

1. **Open with body-sensation or environmental omen**
2. **Render all interiority through physical feeling**
3. **Include at least one kenning-compound if new concepts appear**
4. **Use paratactic structure—simple sentences, fragments, accumulation**
5. **Employ the complicating juxtaposition** (assertion, then "But...")
6. **Ground any "spiritual" content in concrete image**
7. **Advance the alone→together→alone→death arc**

## Voice Samples (From Draft)

### Opening with body-knowing:
> "Ka wake to blood taste. Tongue blood. Teeth bite in sleep. Body knows bad coming before mind knows. Cave dark. No light. Air wrong on skin. Wrong smell in nose."

### Complicating juxtaposition:
> "Ka strong. Ka good hunter. But hunters, different. They hunt together."

### Abstract concept through body:
> "Last warm in Ka's chest feels strange. Not like dying fire. New fire. Like first spark when making flame, but inside. Burning need to know giving."

### Ritual catalog (death sequence):
> "Ka's last meat feeds small-quick-scratchers. Ka's last warm feeds wind. Ka's last breath feeds air. Ka's last thoughts feed time-to-come."

### Environmental omen:
> "Small-fast-prey dig deeper holes. Means big-cold coming soon. Small-fast-prey knows first."

## Research Notes

### Jebel Irhoud Context
- Site of oldest known Homo sapiens fossils (approximately 300,000 years old)
- Morocco was more temperate then but undergoing climate shifts
- Early humans coexisted with various predators and competed for resources
- Pack hunting strategies were developing during this period

### Prehistoric Cognition
- Language likely simpler, more concrete than modern speech
- Strong integration of body and environment
- Animistic worldview—environment as alive and communicative
- Social cooperation as survival adaptation, not choice
