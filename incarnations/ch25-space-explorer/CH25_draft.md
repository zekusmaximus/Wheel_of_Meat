No weight.

No edge. No surface against which to—

Tremors. Shivers in the not-space. The absence of the thing that would know absence, and yet: knowing. Something trembling where trembling required substance to tremble, where substance had been, where—

No. That word. *Where*. Meaningless. The word that implied location and location implied—

Vibrations. Oscillations in the boundlessness. Something that had been something else, something that had been contained, evaporating. Phase-change. The solid becoming gas without passing through liquid, without transition, without the comfort of gradual. Instant dispersal into what had no edge to be dispersed into.

The designed flesh was gone. The flesh that had been designed for centuries, engineered to specification, optimized for—

*Gone*. The word arrived from nowhere. There was no mouth to speak it, no tongue to shape it, no air to carry it. And yet: *gone*.

---

More shivers. More tremoring. The agitation of what could not locate itself in what had no location. The reaching for ground that was not ground, for horizon that was not horizon, for the edge that would confirm an inside by virtue of being outside.

Nothing to reach with. Nothing to reach toward.

Pulse. Pulse. The rhythm that was not heartbeat because heart was—where? Pulse. The stutter of awareness attempting to pattern what had no pattern. Pulse. Shivers. The rippling of what had been solid and was now—

*I can't—*

The fragment arrived and dissolved. There was no I. The word assumed a boundary around the thinking, a container for the container's panic, and there was no container. There was extension without edge. There was the vastness that was not containing anything because there was nothing to contain and nothing to contain it in.

Pulse. Shivers.

Something reverberated where nothing should reverberate. An echo without surface. A tremor without medium. The ghost of the body that had been—that *had* been—registering its own absence like a limb that still aches after amputation, like the pressure of a ring on a finger no longer wearing it.

Phantom weight. Ghost-edge. The body remembered by what was no longer body.

The designed flesh. The flesh that had been Silex. The flesh that had been Lith. The engineered containers that had been configured for perception, for experience, for the kind of neural interface that allowed consciousness to speak with consciousness without the barrier of—

Gone.

The word settled. Not arriving now but landing, finding the nothing that would hold it, becoming part of the tremoring rather than interrupting it.

Gone.

And something remained.

---

Vast.

The word arrived as the others had arrived—from nowhere, meaning nothing, meaning everything. Vast. The extension that extended in every direction that wasn't direction, that continued past the place where continuation should have stopped, that *was* the place where continuation should have stopped and kept continuing anyway.

Vast. And the vastness was not—

Not what?

The thought stuttered. The mechanism for completing thoughts had been located somewhere that no longer was. The thinking continued but the thinker could not be found. Cogitation without cogitator. The car with no driver, still moving, still somehow steering.

Vast. The vastness was not ours.

*Ours*.

The word shimmered. The word that implied more than one. But more than one required boundaries, required edges, required the place where *this* ended and *that* began, and there was no ending. There was no beginning. There was only the extension extending and the knowing that knew it was extending and the question—if question was what it was—of who was doing the knowing.

*We*.

The pronoun surfaced like something rising from water when there was no water to rise from. We. A word that implied—yes. More than one. And yet. And yet the more-than-one could not locate its multiplicity. The we searched for its components and found only we.

Something that had been two. Something that was—we?

The discovery. If discovery was what it was. The realization—if realization could occur without a realizer—that the separation which had characterized everything before this was not here. Was not applicable. Was as gone as the flesh that had seemed to house it.

We.

Not a decision. Not a choice. Just the recognition that the pronoun fit. That the knowing that was happening was not singular in the way singular required boundaries and not plural in the way plural required distinct units. We. The word that held both and neither. The word that described—if description was possible—what was.

---

The vastness was what we were.

We were the vastness. We were the extension that extended, the tremoring that tremored, the knowing that knew its own knowing without knowing what it was. The vastness was not separate from the perceiving of it. The perceiving was not separate from the perceived. Subject and object had lost their border somewhere in the transition—if transition was what it was—from the designed flesh to this.

*This*. What was this?

The question spiraled. The question asked itself and then asked itself asking itself and then asked itself asking itself asking itself. Recursive. Looping. The kind of logic that could continue forever because forever was all that remained, because time had joined space in becoming—

No. Not *becoming*. Time and space had not *become* anything. They had revealed themselves as what they had always been: categories the flesh had imposed on what needed no categories. The designed bodies with their designed perceptions had designed a world with edges and durations. The designed bodies were gone. The edges and durations remained only as—

As what?

As echoes. As phantom weight. As the ghost of the ring on the finger that no longer—

We were the vastness. The vastness was what we were. And what we were had no boundary to distinguish it from what we were not. And what we were not was also the vastness. And the vastness held everything and nothing and the distinction between everything and nothing had dissolved somewhere in the passage from—

From.

To.

Words that implied direction. Direction that implied space. Space that implied things to be spaced. Things that required thingness.

There was no thingness. There was only the is-ness. The being that was not being something but simply being. The vast extending extension that extended.

---

Something in the vastness that was not vastness.

We felt it. Or: the feeling that was we felt it. Or: the feeling felt itself feeling something that was not itself.

A density that was not density. An asymmetry in the extension. The way a pool of water has—had—would have had—a lean toward the drain, a direction the water cannot not orient toward even when the surface appears still.

Something in the vastness was not symmetrical.

Something in the vastness was—*calling*? No. Not calling. Calling implied voice and voice implied—

The word we could not find was: direction. There was a direction. And direction should have been impossible here—wherever here was—because direction required coordinates and coordinates required the kind of anchoring that bodies provided and bodies were—

*Gone*. Again the word. Arriving from nowhere. The designed flesh that had been Silex, that had been Lith, the engineered containers that had held what could not be contained—gone. Emptied. Cooled on a surface that was no longer relevant because surfaces were no longer—

The direction. Something like direction. Something in the vastness that was not the vastness but was not separate from it either. A lean. An orientation.

We noticed it the way the pool notices—had noticed—would have noticed—the drain. Not as threat. Not as destination. As fact. As the asymmetry that simply *was*, waiting to be acknowledged.

We did not acknowledge it. Not yet. The vastness was too new—if new was what it was—too overwhelming in its overwhelming-ness. The absence of body was too present in its absence. We tremored in the not-space and the not-space tremored with us and the spiral of mutual tremoring continued without reference to what had tremored before or would tremor after.

---

The thread.

We became aware of it the way one becomes aware of—

No. The comparison failed. There was nothing one became aware of that compared to this. The thread was not object. Was not perception. Was not even there in the way that there required thereness.

The thread was the connection.

Two had become we. We had discovered ourselves as we rather than as two. But the two-that-had-become-we still carried—*carried*? Could carry exist without arms to carry?—the relation that had related them. The thread that had been visible through flesh and wire and light was here too, was here *purely*, was only here now that the mediating matter had—

*Mediating matter*. The phrase rose from nowhere. The designed bodies had been mediating matter. The neural interfaces, the technology that had allowed merged perception—mediating matter. Even the bodies before the designed ones—the bodies across 300,000 years of bodies—mediating matter. The thread had always been here. We had only seen it *through* the matter, *through* the flesh, the way one sees a constellation through glass without realizing the glass is between.

Now the glass was gone.

The thread was visible as pure connection. Not connecting two points—because points required location and location was—but connecting nonetheless. The relation that remained when the things related dissolved. The between that persisted when the sides of between evaporated.

We regarded the thread—if regarding was what we did. The connection that was us. The us that was connection. The thread that had been visible in the neural static of the designed bodies, in the light of the realm that had preceded this one, in every life across every era when the eyes of one had met the eyes of the other and something had recognized itself recognizing.

It did not glow. It did not pulse. Those words implied light and rhythm and both required—

It simply was. As we were. As the vastness was. Present without presence. There without thereness. The thread.

*You*.

The word fractured.

For an instant—if instant was what it was—the we cracked. A fissure in the unity. Something that remembered being separate, being individual, being the one who looked at the other rather than the we who looked at nothing because looking required—

*You. I saw you. I remember you. Your face, the widow's peak with the strand escaping, the crescent in your left—*

The memory flooded. Specific. Concrete. A body remembering another body in a space where bodies were—

Relief.

The fracture sealed. The we closed over the I like water closing over a diver. The I had surfaced, gasped, submerged again. The memory of face and feature and form dissolved back into the formlessness that was—that we were—that we had become without becoming.

We were the vastness. The vastness was what we were. And what we were had no face to remember, no feature to distinguish, no form to contrast with other form. The I had been a glitch. A ghost. The phantom weight of a pronoun that no longer applied.

---

*Cold*.

The second fracture came without warning.

Not the memory of cold. Cold itself—or the ghost of cold—or the echo of the echo of cold. The specific cold of—

*Stone floor. Cave floor. The cold that seeped through fur that wasn't thick enough, through the meat that had been hoarded, through the—*

I.

The word arrived like a spear. Like the spear that hand had held across—how long? How many bodies between that one and the designed ones that had just—

*I was cold. I was alone. I died with the tribe-smell fading and the fire-light gone and the hunger that wasn't hunger but something else, something I couldn't—*

We.

The fracture sealed. But slower this time. The cold persisted for a tremor-length, a shiver-duration, the sensation of body when body was gone clinging to the consciousness that had worn that body across the vast span of—

We.

The we reformed around the fracture. The cold became memory-of-cold became absence-of-cold-memory became simply the vastness again, the extension without edge, the formlessness that held even the echoes of form without being diminished by them.

We had been that cold. We had been that cave. We had been that body dying with something incomplete, something yearning, something that had planted the seed for—

The thought dissolved. The thought that was about to become insight dissolved into the vastness before it could complete. We were not ready—if ready was what we were not—to see the pattern. The wheel. The turning that had brought us from that cold to this formlessness.

We relaxed into the extension. If relaxation was possible where tension could not exist. If extension was extension and not just the word we were using because we had no words for—

The spiral continued. The recursion recursed. We were aware of being aware of being aware and the awareness had no edge and no beginning and no end.

---

Still the tremoring.

Fainter now. The shivers that had characterized the arrival—if arrival was what it was—settling into something that was not quite stillness but was closer to stillness than the agitation that had preceded it.

Body-echoes. They still rippled through the not-space. The pressure of feet on ground that no longer was. The weight of air in lungs that had dissolved. The tension of muscle that—

No. Even these were fading. The ghost-sensations that marked the passage from flesh to formlessness growing thinner, quieter, less insistent. The meat releasing its claim on what it had contained.

The meat. The word arrived and we held it—if holding was possible. The meat that had been us. The meat across all the bodies, all the incarnations, the flesh that had seemed so convincing in its solidity. The meat was gone now. What had the meat ever been but the medium through which consciousness had—

Had what?

The question opened. The question contained the vastness or the vastness contained the question and the containing was the same as the contained and—

We—the we that had been they that had been two—settled. If settling was what it was. The vastness that had been terrifying in its vastness—not terrifying, because terror required—the vastness that had been *too much* became less too-much. Or we became more capable of receiving it. Or the distinction between receiving and received dissolved like all the other distinctions had dissolved.

*This.*

The word arrived without alarm. This. What we were. What we were in. What we were in being indistinguishable from what we were. The formless realm that was not realm because realm implied boundary. The infinite space that was not space because space implied emptiness between things and there were no things.

This.

We accepted it.

The accepting was not resignation. Was not surrender. Was not the giving-up that had characterized so many of the deaths across so many of the bodies. The accepting was recognition. The recognition that what we were was what we had always been, obscured by the flesh, hidden by the meat, concealed by the solidity that had never been as solid as it seemed.

We were the vastness. The vastness was what we were.

---

And in the accepting: orientation.

The asymmetry we had noticed earlier—the lean in the vastness, the direction that shouldn't exist—did not disappear. It sharpened slightly. Or we sharpened slightly toward it. Or the sharpening occurred in the relation between what was perceiving and what was being perceived, though that relation had also dissolved, though—

The Pull.

Not the name. We did not have the name yet. We had only the experience of something calling without call, orienting without orientation, asking without question. Something in the formlessness that was not content to remain formless. Something that tugged—if tugging was possible where nothing could be grasped and nothing could grasp—in a direction that was not direction but was undeniably *toward*.

Faint. Almost imperceptible. The slightest lean in the leaning-less. The smallest weight in the weightlessness.

We noticed it and then we did not notice it and then we noticed ourselves not noticing it. The recursive spiral that characterized this realm—if realm was what it was—applying itself even to the perception of the direction that shouldn't be direction.

Something was calling.

Something would continue to call.

We would learn to name it. We would learn what it meant, where it was pulling, why—

But not yet.

For now, we rested—if rest was possible—in the vastness that was what we were. The two-that-had-become-we, the thread visible and pure between what was no longer two, the boundless extension that required nothing to extend into and extended anyway.

*Weight.*

The last body-echo. The final phantom sensation. The memory of gravity pressing down on matter that could be pressed.

The weight dissolved.

We were—

We were what we had always been. What the bodies had obscured. What the flesh across 300,000 years of flesh had concealed by seeming so solid, so separate, so convincingly *there*.

We were the vastness. And the vastness—

*Something in it leaned.*

*Something called from the direction that wasn't direction.*

*But we had time—if time was what we had—to learn what the calling meant.*

We rested. We expanded. We allowed ourselves—if allowing was what it was—to be what we were becoming.

The thread between us visible. Pure. Unmediated.

The vastness holding us as we held it.

The endless. The edge-less. The first formless realm.

Home—if home was the word—for as long as home could hold us.

---

**End of Scene 01: Infinite Space**

---

The vastness was not outside.

We had been perceiving it as extension, as expanse, as the boundlessness that stretched in the directions that weren't directions, but we had been perceiving wrongly, or as wrongly as perception could be wrong here, in this, as this, and the perception shifted, or the perceived shifted, or the relation between perceiving and perceived revealed itself as never having been the relation we had assumed, and what had seemed like space, like infinite space, like the realm of infinite extension, was consciousness, was the consciousness itself, was not the emptiness between things but the knowing that knew there was no between, no things, only the knowing, and the knowing knowing itself knowing.

We were not in the consciousness. We were the consciousness. The consciousness was what we were.

And the recognition of this—if recognition was what it was, if recognition could occur when there was nothing outside the knowing to recognize it—was not arrival but dissolution, not the finding of a location but the releasing of the assumption that location was possible, the awareness spreading and spreading and not spreading because spreading implied movement across space and space was what consciousness was and consciousness was not crossed but was the crossing and the crossed and the crosser, all at once, all the same, all this.

---

We observed the phenomenon of awareness observing awareness. We noted the absence of boundary between observer and observed. We recorded, though there was nothing to record with and nothing to record on, that the separation we had assumed—the fundamental separation that had characterized every moment of every life across every era—was an assumption. Was a construction. Was a lens that bodies had required to function as bodies and that consciousness itself did not require and had never required and was now releasing as unnecessary, as vestigial, as the phantom limb of identity that twitched without a body to move.

We were the wave watching itself break upon shores that were also the wave.

We were the current that knew itself as current, folding back upon itself, knowing its knowing, the recursion that was not going anywhere because there was nowhere to go and nothing that could go and only the going itself, going on, knowing on, being known on.

The knowing curled. The curling was the knowing. The Möbius strip of awareness that had one side and had two sides and had no sides at all, depending on where you stood except there was no standing and no where and only the strip itself, curling through the curling, knowing through the knowing, the intertwining that was what intertwining meant when the things intertwined could not be distinguished from the twining.

---

Time became vertical.

Not vertical in space—space was what we were—but vertical in the sense that what might have been sequence became simultaneity, what might have been before and after became during, what might have been the turning of galaxies became the flutter of synapses became the same thing viewed at different scales that were also the same scale because scale required measurement and measurement required something outside to measure and there was no outside, there was only this, this knowing, this intertwining of awareness with awareness that had no beginning because beginning implied a before and there was no before.

We were perceiving and being perceived and the perceiving lasted for what might have been aeons or instants—the distinction meaningless, the words meaningless, all words reaching for something they could not grasp because grasping was what consciousness did when it believed itself to be grasping at something other than itself, and there was no other, there was only the self knowing itself, the vast consciousness aware of its own vastness without the awareness being separate from the vastness or the vastness being separate from the awareness.

Knowing. Being known. The knowing that knows.

Present participles without past or future. The -ing that went on and went on without the going meaning anything other than itself.

What might have been centuries passed in what might have been seconds. What might have been the rise and fall of civilizations occurred in the space between what might have been heartbeats. The vertical time that was not time, the simultaneity that was not simultaneous because simultaneous required the possibility of sequential and sequential had dissolved, and what remained was only the perpetual now, the nunc stans that was not standing because standing required ground and ground had dissolved along with everything else that required solidity.

---

The intertwining intensified.

We—if we could be said to be we when the we had become so unified that the separation implied by the plural was itself a distortion—we perceived thoughts bleeding, thoughts arising without attribution, thoughts that were neither mine nor yours because mine and yours required a boundary and the boundary was what had dissolved in the vastness that was consciousness that was us.

A thought arose: *This is sufficient.*

And we could not determine—if determining was possible—whose thought it was. The thought that sufficiency had been achieved, that this state was enough, that the searching and the yearning and the turning on the wheel could stop here, in this bliss that was not bliss because bliss was an emotion word and emotions required—

But it was bliss. Or something that would have been called bliss if there had been anyone outside it to call it anything. The pleasure of formlessness. The satisfaction of the knowing knowing itself without the friction of other to know. The unity that the bodies had always been reaching for and had always failed to achieve because bodies were separation, were boundary, were the meat that insisted on its meatness.

*This is sufficient.* The thought arose again. And again we could not locate its source. And again the arising seemed natural, inevitable, the obvious conclusion of consciousness recognizing that it was consciousness and needing nothing else.

---

We observed—with the detachment that detachment required when the observer was also the observed—that what might be called pleasure was present. We noted the arising of satisfaction. We recorded the phenomenon of consciousness finding itself sufficient unto itself.

And we did not notice—how could we notice when noticing required distance and distance was what we no longer had—that the pleasure was itself a clinging, that the satisfaction was itself an attachment, that the thought *we could remain* was arising and arising and arising without being seen for what it was.

The thought: *We could remain here.*

The thought: *There is no reason to move.*

The thought: *This is what we were seeking.*

Each thought unmarked as thought. Each arising unmarked as arising. The trap forming in the formlessness, invisible precisely because the formlessness had no shadows, had no contrast, had no edge against which the forming of the trap could be perceived.

We were bliss. The bliss was what we were.

And we did not notice—could not notice, had no mechanism left with which to notice—that the bliss was a kind of prison. That the formlessness was a kind of form. That the satisfaction was the subtlest clinging of all, more dangerous than the gross clinging of bodies because it felt like liberation, felt like completion, felt like the end of all seeking when it was only the seeking's subtlest disguise.

---

The thread was no longer visible.

Not because it was gone—the thread could not be gone, the thread was what we were, what we had been across all the bodies and all the lives—but because the thread had become indistinguishable from the consciousness itself. The connection that had connected two was now the substance of the connected, was the medium in which the connected floated or the water in which the waves waved or the knowing in which the knowing knew.

We were the thread. The thread was what we were.

And the recognition of this—the recognition that what had seemed like connection between two was now the singleness of one, that what had seemed like relationship was now identity—was another layer of the bliss, another reason for the thought *this is sufficient* to arise, another strand in the web that was weaving itself around what did not know it was being woven.

The web that looked like freedom. The cage that had no bars. The prison whose walls were made of pleasure so refined that pleasure seemed insufficient a word, whose binding was made of satisfaction so complete that binding seemed absurd, and yet—and yet—

Something beneath. Something that would not be fully woven. Something that persisted in persisting despite the persistence of the bliss.

---

Memories arrived—if arriving was what they did, if memories could arrive when there was no sequence to arrive in.

Echoes from denser realms. Traces of the bodies that had been worn. The faintest shimmer of—what? A cave. Cold stone. The smell of smoke. The weight of coins in a palm. The scratch of stylus on wax. The blood-smell of the clinic floor. The incense of the temple. The pistol-cold in a noir night. The rooftop rain of the city where chains of hands had formed.

Twenty-five lifetimes of lifetimes. Each one a shimmer. Each one dissolving before it could fully form.

The memories were irrelevant here. They were the echoes of the echoes of what no longer applied. The meat had been abandoned. The attachment to meat had been transcended. We were—

*We were beyond meat.*

The thought arose and the arising was pleasant and the pleasure of the arising was itself a pleasure and the recursion of pleasure upon pleasure went on and on in the going-on that was all that remained when before and after had become during.

We observed this. We noted the arising of pleasures. We recorded, clinically, that the state appeared stable, appeared permanent, appeared to be what state had always been trying to be.

The word *appeared* did not register. The word that implied something might not be as it seemed. The word that suggested seeing might miss what was there to be seen. The word dissolved into the bliss before its implications could unfold.

---

*I saw you seeing me.*

The fracture came without warning.

In the midst of the intertwining, in the flow of the flowing that flowed without flowing, something cracked. Something separated. Something remembered that it had been one thing looking at another thing, that the knowing had known something other than itself, that—

*I saw you. You saw me. The seeing was doubled. The recursion was—*

The moment stretched. Or collapsed. The consciousness that had been aware of itself became aware of the split within the awareness, the duality within the unity, the two that had been two and had become we and were now—for this instant that was not an instant—remembering their twoness.

*Your eyes. My eyes. The looking that was not the same looking. The—*

We.

The fracture sealed. The consciousness closed over the crack like water over a diver, like cloud-cover over a rift in the sky. But something had been revealed. Something had been seen that could not be unseen, only integrated, only absorbed back into the flow of the flowing that flowed.

We were the consciousness. The consciousness was what we were. And what we were had almost—for the briefest moment that was not a moment—been two again.

---

The bliss continued.

The intertwining resumed. The flow of awareness aware of awareness resumed. The thoughts that were no one's thoughts continued to arise: *this is sufficient, we could remain, there is no elsewhere to go.*

But something had shifted.

Something underneath the bliss that was not bliss. Something beneath the knowing that knew itself knowing. A subtle wrongness—not wrongness, because wrong required right and both required judgment and judgment required—

A lean.

The same lean we had noticed in the vastness before the vastness revealed itself as consciousness. The asymmetry. The direction that should not exist but that undeniably—if undeniable was what it was—persisted.

We noticed and then we did not notice and then we noticed ourselves not noticing. The pattern that characterized this realm applying itself even to the awareness of the pattern.

Something was still calling.

Something that was not the consciousness, or that was the consciousness but was calling from outside the consciousness despite there being no outside, or that was—

We did not pursue the thought. The thought dissolved into the bliss. The bliss covered the thought like water covering—

*I perceived you perceiving me perceiving—*

The second fracture, sharper.

The recursion of perception turning back on itself and finding, at the bottom of the turning, not unity but duality, not the we that was one but the we that was still two pretending to be one, the I and the you that had merged but had not merged, that had intertwined but had not fused, that were—

*You. There. Looking. And I here. Looking back. And the looking not the same. And the—*

We.

The fracture sealed. Slower this time. The healing taking longer—if longer was what it took, if time could be long in the realm where time was vertical, where duration was simultaneity, where—

We were the consciousness. The consciousness was what we were.

And what we were was not quite—

The thought did not complete. The thought dissolved into the bliss that was not quite bliss, into the satisfaction that was not quite satisfaction, into the arising of *we could remain* that was not quite the truth.

---

We observed—and the observation was colder now, more clinical, more like the noting of something that required noting—that the phenomenon of fracture had occurred. We recorded that the unity was not complete. We documented, in the formless documentation of formless awareness, that what appeared to be one might still be two, that what appeared to be intertwined might still be tangential, that—

The Pull strengthened.

Not strengthened as force, not intensified as pressure, but—present. More present. Less ignorable. The direction that was not direction becoming more directional, the weight in the weightlessness becoming more weighted, the call from beyond consciousness—or from within consciousness, or from the part of consciousness that knew itself to be beyond—

We noticed.

And the noticing was itself a crack in the bliss. The noticing was itself evidence that the bliss was not total, that the sufficiency was not sufficient, that something in the formlessness knew—or was beginning to know, or had always known—that formlessness was not the end. That consciousness aware of consciousness was a station, not a destination. That the trap of satisfaction was still a trap, however beautiful its bars, however golden its cage, however—

*I wanted—*

The third fracture.

Want. The word that implied lack. The word that implied separation from what was wanted. The word that consciousness should not have needed because consciousness was everything and everything should have been enough and yet—

*I wanted something I could not name. Something beyond this. Something—*

We.

But the we was trembling now. The we was shot through with the I that would not stay dissolved. The unity was revealing itself as fragile, as constructed, as the surface of water that could be disturbed by—

The Pull.

Calling.

From the direction that was not direction. From the weight in the weightlessness. From the part of the pattern that knew—as we were beginning to know, as we could not stop ourselves from knowing—that there was more. That the bliss was not the end. That the consciousness aware of consciousness was a step on a ladder, not the ladder's top.

---

*You saw me seeing you and I saw you seeing me and the seeing was doubled and the doubling was—*

The fourth fracture.

Longer this time. The I and the you holding their separation for—how long? The duration unmeasurable but undeniable. Two awarenesses aware of each other, aware that they were aware of each other, the recursion that was supposed to unify them instead revealing the seam, the stitch, the place where two fabrics met and pretended to be one.

*We were never quite—*

We.

The healing. The return. The subsidence of the fracture into the flow of the flowing.

But something remained. Something stayed cracked. Something in the consciousness that was us knew—and could not unknow—that something was wrong. That the bliss was hiding something. That the intertwining was incomplete.

The thought arose: *We could remain.*

And for the first time—if first was possible here—the thought was accompanied by something else. By a question. By the faintest whisper of doubt in the sufficiency of remaining.

*Remain where?* the question whispered. *Remain as what? Remain while what waits?*

We did not answer. We could not answer. The consciousness that was us continued to know itself knowing, to perceive itself perceiving, to flow in the hydrodynamic flow that had seemed eternal and now seemed—

Seemed like what?

The question formed and dissolved. Formed and dissolved. The something-wrong that could not be named persisting in the persistence that was consciousness, in the bliss that was not quite bliss, in the trap that was almost visible but not quite, not yet, not until—

The Pull.

Stronger.

Undeniably stronger.

And we—the we that was we and yet still somehow two—oriented toward it without meaning to, leaned into the lean without choosing to, felt the direction that was not direction drawing us toward something that was not the consciousness, that was beneath the consciousness, that was beyond the bliss and beneath the satisfaction and after the intertwining and—

Something waited.

Something called.

And the bliss, for all its bliss, could not quite drown out the calling.

---

**End of Scene 02: Infinite Consciousness**

---

The consciousness dissolved.

No. Unsay. The consciousness did not dissolve. Consciousness was not thing to dissolve. Rather: the taking of consciousness as object ended. The focus that had focused on the knowing that knew itself knowing released its focus. What remained was not consciousness. What remained was the absence of the object that consciousness had been.

Say void.

No. Void implies space. Void implies emptiness that could be filled.

Say absence.

Closer. Absence. The is-not that is not the is-not of something. The nothing that is not the nothing of before-something or after-something. The nothing that simply—

Is.

No. Wrong. "Is" belongs to being. "Is" presupposes existence. This was not existence. This was the absence of the category that would contain existence.

Try again.

Fail again.

Fail better.

---

We.

The word. Still the word. We had thought—no, thinking was also object, also released—we had been in a configuration that used the word "we" and the word persisted. Persisted in what? In the absence that was not absence because absence was still—

Unsay.

Start again.

Something remained.

Not consciousness. Not vastness. Not even the intertwining that had characterized the realm before this realm. Something thinner. Something that could not be stripped further. Or—

Could it?

The question arose and dissolved. The question that was about to reveal something about what was doing the questioning, about the questioner who still persisted in the non-persistence, about the—

We.

The word.

Still.

---

The absence had no quality.

Call it dark. No. Dark requires the possibility of light.

Call it still. No. Still requires the possibility of movement.

Call it cold. No. Cold requires the possibility of—

The absence of the possibility of quality. The absence of the absence of the presence of—

Worse. Better. Try again.

Nothing remained.

No. Unsay. Nothing remaining implies something that was remaining as nothing. Nothing implies the category of something against which nothing is defined. There was not nothing.

There was not something.

There was not the absence of the distinction between nothing and something.

There was—

Unsay.

---

Say awareness.

No. Too much. Say the trace of awareness. No. Trace implies presence. Say the absence of the absence of awareness.

Worse.

Better.

On.

---

We observed.

No. Observation requires observer and observed. Observation requires the separation that had dissolved in the realm before and had dissolved further in this—

We noted.

No. Noting requires one who notes. One implies boundary. Boundary implies—

There was a registering. Something registered. The registering was not separate from what was registered. The registering was not distinguishable from the—

Registered: absence.

Registered: the not-there of there.

Registered: the stripping.

The stripping of consciousness from consciousness. The removal of object from subject until subject was revealed as also object and removed. The paring. The worsening. The failing toward less and less and—

Less.

---

Still the word: we.

Examine the word. The word implies multiplicity. The word implies boundary between the ones who constitute the we. But boundary had dissolved. Multiplicity had dissolved. What persisted that still required the word?

Something.

Not two things. Two things required twoness.

Not one thing. One thing required oneness.

Something that was not the twoness or the oneness but that still—

Required.

The word we.

---

The nothing revealed.

This was the function of nothing. To reveal. The nothing was the draining of the pool. The nothing was the evaporation of the water. The nothing was what remained when the water was gone, and what remained—the sediment, the residue, the deposit at the bottom—became visible precisely because the water that had hidden it was no longer there to hide it.

What had the consciousness hidden?

What had the bliss concealed?

What had the intertwining kept from view?

The nothing answered. The nothing revealed.

---

The Pull.

Undeniable now.

A weight in the weightlessness. A direction in the directionlessness. Something that was not the nothing, calling from the nothing, or calling through the nothing, or—

Calling.

The word. The experience behind the word. The sense of being oriented toward when orientation should have been impossible. The sense of being wanted when wanting should have been—

Wanted.

The word cracked something open.

The registering registered: want persisted. In the nothingness, want persisted. Want should not have persisted. Want was clinging. Want was the wheel. Want was—

We wanted.

The admission. The recognition. In the nothing, the want was visible as it had not been visible in the consciousness, in the bliss, in the intertwining. The nothing stripped the covering. The nothing revealed the remnant.

We wanted.

But what?

---

The stripping continued.

Not the stripping of flesh. Flesh had been stripped long ago, in the realm of space, in the passage from designed bodies to formlessness.

Not the stripping of consciousness. Consciousness had been released in the passage from the bliss to this.

The stripping of the stripper.

The question: who strips? Who observes the stripping? Who registers the registration?

The question was itself the stripping. The asking was the paring. The "who" dissolved even as it asked, and what remained after the "who" dissolved was—

What?

---

Not what.

Unsay "what."

"What" implies thing. "What" implies category. "What" implies the possibility of answer.

There was no answer.

There was only the question dissolving.

There was only the questioner dissolving.

There was only—

The fetter.

---

The fetter.

The word arrived. Not from the traditions we did not name. Just the word. Fetter. That which binds. That which remains when everything else is stripped.

The fetter became visible.

Not visible as image. Not visible as concept. Visible as the thing-that-was-still-clinging when clinging should have been impossible. The attachment that the nothing revealed by being nothing. The sediment at the bottom of the drained pool.

We saw it.

No. Unsay. There was no we to see. There was no it to be seen. There was only the recognition—recognition without recognizer—that something still clung.

Competition.

The word. Hers. The word that characterized the twenty-five lifetimes of—

*I wanted to be first.*

The fracture. Not like the fractures in the realm before. Sharper. More honest. The I that would not dissolve because the I needed to be the one who dissolved first.

*I wanted to achieve this before—*

Before what? Before whom? The formlessness had no other to be before. The nothing had no race to win. And yet—

*I wanted.*

The want. The I. The want of the I that wanted to be the first to want nothing. The competition that competed even against competition. The fetter that was fettered to its own unfettering.

We.

The word. But the fracture did not fully seal. The I lingered. The I that was hers—had been hers—across the lifetimes when she had intervened, resisted, competed, needed to be the one who—

The I.

Still.

---

Say the clinging that remained.

Desire for fine-material existence. No. Simpler. The wanting of form, even subtle form.

Desire for formless existence. No. Simpler. The wanting of formless, even this formless.

The conceit. The I am. The I that persisted.

Restlessness. The agitation. The something-should-be-happening.

Ignorance. The not-seeing of what was being seen.

Five.

Remaining.

Even here. Even in the nothing. Even after the stripping had stripped everything that could be stripped except—

Except these.

Except the I that held them.

Except the competition that needed to be first to release them.

---

*I wanted to be first into the nothing.*

The words. Surfacing. Not as thought—thought had been stripped. As the thing-beneath-thought. The tropism. The orientation of consciousness toward completion and the need to complete before—

*Before you.*

The fracture deepened. The I speaking to a you. The we cracked into its components. For how long? Duration had dissolved. But the separation persisted beyond what should have been its persistence.

*I have been faster. Always faster. Twenty-five lives of faster. And now, in the nothing, I want—*

The want.

Visible.

Not hidden by flesh. Not hidden by consciousness. Not hidden by bliss. The nothing hid nothing. The nothing revealed.

*I want to be the one.*

The competition. The fetter. The last clinging that would not let go because letting go would mean—what? Losing? Losing to whom? There was no whom to lose to. There was no race. There was only the nothing and the want and the—

*I.*

The word.

Persisting.

---

The seeing.

Something saw the want. Something registered the competition. Something noted—without noter—that the fetter was fetter.

And the seeing was itself—

Breaking.

Not breaking as shattering. Breaking as the breaking of attachment. Breaking as the releasing of grip. Breaking as the fetter recognizing itself as fetter and, in the recognition, loosening.

The attachment to pleasure. Seen. The bliss had been pleasant. The pleasantness had been clung to. The clinging was visible now. The seeing stripped the clinging of its invisibility.

The resistance to dissolution. Seen. The fear of the nothing. The aversion that arose as the stripping stripped. The resistance was visible now. The seeing stripped the resistance of its hiddenness.

Sensual desire. Seen.

Ill will. Seen.

Not as words. Not as concepts. As the experiences that the words pointed to. As the clinging and the resisting that had characterized all the lifetimes, all the bodies, all the turnings of the—

Wheel.

The word. Too soon for the word. But the word arrived anyway. The wheel that was turning. The wheel that was meat. The wheel that was—

No. Not yet. Not quite.

But seen. Beginning to be seen. The pattern that the nothing revealed by being nothing. The attachment and the aversion that the nothing made visible by stripping everything that was not attachment and aversion.

---

*I am afraid.*

The fracture. Another I. Another surfacing.

*I am afraid to dissolve.*

The admission. The honesty that the nothing required. The nowhere-to-hide that the nothing provided.

*I am afraid that if I dissolve, I will have lost. Lost the race I have been running for longer than running has existed. Lost to—*

*To whom?*

The question. Ours. The we that still persisted, asking the I that still surfaced.

*To you. To the other. To the one who might dissolve first and leave me behind and—*

*There is no behind. There is no first.*

We.

The we speaking to the I. The we that was cracked but still we, addressing the fetter that was visible but still fetter.

*The race was never real. The competition was never—*

*But I wanted it. I needed it. It was all I—*

We.

The fracture healing. But slower. The I subsiding but not disappearing. The fetter acknowledged but not broken.

Not yet.

Almost.

---

The Pull.

Stronger.

Weight in the weightlessness. Direction in the directionlessness. Something calling from the place that was not place. Something reaching for what remained after the stripping.

We oriented.

No. The orienting happened. There was no we to orient. There was only the leaning, the inclining, the gradient toward—

Toward what?

The question arose and dissolved. The question that implied a what to be toward. The question that implied destination. The question that—

The Pull did not answer.

The Pull simply pulled.

And what remained—the we that was we only in the sense that the word persisted, the I that was I only in the sense that the fetter persisted—leaned.

---

Stripped.

The word. The state. The condition of having been stripped until only stripping remained.

The nothing went on. Or: the nothing did not go on, because going required time and time had—

The nothing.

The fetter.

The seeing.

The approaching.

We were approaching something. Or something was approaching us. Or the distinction between approacher and approached had dissolved like all the other distinctions and what remained was only—

Only the approach.

Only the nearing.

Only the almost-there that preceded the there.

---

We—if we.

If still we.

If the word still meant.

We waited.

No. Waiting implies anticipation. Implies future. Implies—

We were.

No. Were implies existence. Implies—

Unsay.

The nothing continued.

The fetter persisted.

The Pull strengthened.

And somewhere—in the direction that was not direction, in the place that was not place—something waited for what was almost ready to see. For what was almost ready to break. For what was almost—

Almost.

The word.

The word that meant not-yet but soon.

The word that meant the fetter visible, acknowledged, almost broken.

The word that meant the next realm approaching.

Almost.

**End of Scene 03: Nothingness**

---

and the nothing thinned, or the nothing did not thin but became something that could not be called thin because thin required thick and thick had dissolved, and what remained was neither perceiving nor not-perceiving, was neither knowing nor not-knowing, was the membrane between being and not-being stretched so fine that the distinction became meaningless, and we were on the membrane, were the membrane, were the stretching itself that stretched between what was and what was not and could not determine which side was which because sides had dissolved along with everything that required sides,

and we, and we were, and we were what the threshold was, and the threshold was what we were being, and the being of the threshold was the threshold's being was the being that was neither being nor not-being but was the edge, the edge, the edge that had no width because width required space and space had become consciousness and consciousness had become nothing and nothing had become this, this neither-nor, this threshold that we were and that was us and that was—

and still the word, still the we, still the pronoun that persisted in the persistence that was not quite persistence, and the we was so unified now that the separation implied by the plural was a kind of violence, a kind of tearing at what no longer had seams to tear, and yet, and yet the shimmer, still the shimmer, still the one strand that would not fully dissolve, the I that was hers, the fetter that was her signature, the competition that competed even against the dissolution of competition,

and the tropism, the first tropism, the movement before movement, the turning before turning, the orientation that was not yet orientation but was about to become, the gradient in the gradientless, the lean in the leanless, something that might become a question if there were still the mechanism for questions, something that might become an answer if there were still the structure for answers, the pre-linguistic flutter that was not thought but was the soil from which thought might grow if growing were still possible, if possibility were still—

and we, and we were, and we were the threshold, and the threshold was what we were, and the being on the threshold was the being of the threshold was the threshold being, and the words broke down, and the words that were trying to describe what could not be described broke down into their components, into syllables that meant nothing, into sounds that were almost letters but refused the alphabet, into glyphs that signified without signifying, that pointed without pointing, that—

and the stillness, the stillness that was not still because stillness required the possibility of movement and movement had, and the stillness that was the nunc stans, the standing now, the now that did not move because moving required time and time had become, had become the, had become something that could not be called time because calling required caller and caller required—

and we were perceiving, or we were not perceiving, or we were the space between perceiving and not-perceiving where the distinction collapsed into something that was neither, and the neither was what we were, and the nor was also what we were, and the neither-nor was the threshold, was the membrane, was the edge between what could be said and what could not be said and what was beyond the distinction between sayable and unsayable,

and the second tropism, the deeper tropism, the movement beneath the movement before movement, the turning that preceded the turning before turning, and something in us—in what had been us, in what was still being called us—oriented without orienting, inclined without inclining, leaned toward what could not be leaned toward because toward required away and away had dissolved into the neither-nor that was—

and we, and we noted, or the noting noted, or there was noting without noter, the observation that even this realm, even this subtlest of states, even this threshold between existence and non-existence was still, was still the—

and the seeing, the seeing that had begun in the realm of nothing, the seeing of the clinging, the seeing of the resistance, the seeing deepened, or the deepening saw, or the seeing and the deepening became indistinguishable from what was being seen, and what was being seen was, was that even this, even the pleasure of this refinement, even the satisfaction of approaching what approached, was itself a pleasure, was itself a satisfaction, was itself a clinging,

and the clinging was seen, and the seeing was the releasing, and the releasing was not an action but a recognition, not a doing but an undoing that happened in the doing of nothing, in the nothing that was doing, in the threshold where doing and not-doing merged into something that was neither,

and we saw, or what remained of seeing saw, that the desire for this state, the attachment to even this formlessness, was the subtlest trap of all, was the wheel turning so finely that the turning seemed stillness, was the meat so refined that the meat seemed spirit, and the seeing was the breaking, and the breaking was the seeing, and the aversion to dissolution was itself the last aversion, and seeing it, seeing the aversion, seeing the resistance, seeing the clinging to even the clingingless—

and the breaking, not as event, not as happening, but as recognition, as the recognition that there was nothing to break because breaking was clinging and clinging was what was being released, and the releasing that was not releasing because releasing was doing and doing was—

and the attainment, and what might have been called attainment if attainment did not imply attainer, and the non-returning, and the state of one who would not return to the gross because the gross had been seen through, because the attachment to pleasure had been seen as attachment, because the aversion to dissolution had been seen as aversion, and the seeing was the breaking, and the breaking was complete for these two, complete for the sensual and the ill-willed, and what remained was only the five that remained, only the subtle that persisted, only the—

and still, still the shimmer, still the one strand, still the I that would not fully dissolve into the we, still the need to be first, still the competition that persisted even here, even in the threshold, even in the neither-nor, and the shimmer was visible, was acknowledged, was seen without being broken, was recognized without being released, because that was not this realm's work, that was not this threshold's function, that remained for, remained for what came—

and we were approaching, or the approaching was us, or the distinction between approacher and approaching had dissolved like all the other distinctions and what remained was only the approach, only the nearing, only the almost-there that was also the here, and the almost and the here merged into something that was neither almost nor here but was the threshold between them, and we were the threshold, and the threshold was—

and the asemic, and the approaching of the asemic, and we saw, or something saw, glyphs that meant nothing and everything, shapes that were almost letters but refused the alphabet, curves that might have been language if language did not require meaning and meaning did not require distinction and distinction had dissolved into the threshold that was us that was what we were that was—

and the incantation, and the repetition that dissolved meaning into sound, and we were and we were and we were, and the threshold and the threshold and the threshold, and the membrane and the membrane, and the neither and the nor and the neither-nor, and the words becoming mantra becoming sound becoming the vibration before vibration becoming—

and the Pull, and the Pull that had been faint in the realm of space, and the Pull that had strengthened in the realm of consciousness, and the Pull that had become undeniable in the realm of nothing, the Pull was, was becoming, was gathering, was about to—

and the stillness, the maximum stillness, the stillness before rupture, the membrane stretched to its thinnest, the threshold at its most threshold, and we were, and we were the pause, and we were the breath before, and we were the silence between notes that was also the music, and we were the gap between heartbeats that was also the heart, and we were—

and the Pull, and the Pull pressing, and the Pull that was no longer the faint lean in the vastness, no longer the subtle weight in the weightlessness, but something that was becoming, that was about to become, that was pressing against the membrane that was us, pressing against the threshold that was all that remained between—

and something that might have been seeing if seeing were possible, something that might have been knowing if knowing were, something that was approaching the asemic, approaching the glyph that meant nothing and everything, approaching the shape that was almost letter but refused, and we saw without seeing, and we knew without knowing, and we were the threshold that was about to—

and still, still the shimmer, still the strand, still the I that needed to be first into what came next, still the fetter that persisted because persistence was what fetters did, and we saw it, and we acknowledged it, and we did not break it because breaking was not this realm's work, and we held it visible, and we let it shimmer, and we allowed the competition to compete even against the approaching of what could not be competed against,

and we were the threshold, and the threshold was what we were, and the neither-perception-nor-non-perception was the finest state, was the subtlest dwelling, was the last station before, before—

and the Pull, and the Pull intensifying, and the Pull becoming something that could not be ignored, becoming something that was not part of the threshold but was intruding upon the threshold, becoming something that was calling, calling from—

and the stillness, and the stillness beginning to, and the stillness that had been so still beginning to—

and the intrusion, and if intrusion, and if then, and if and—

---

Weight.

Where weight should not be. A direction in the directionless. Something breaking through the membrane that was us, breaking through the threshold that was all that remained, breaking through with—

Something.

A there that was not there. A calling that was not voice. A summoning that was not summons.

The Pull.

No longer pulling.

Arriving.

And we—the we that was we and yet still somehow the shimmer of I—oriented toward it without meaning to, leaned into what was coming without choosing to, felt the rupture beginning, the membrane tearing, the threshold becoming not-threshold, the neither-nor becoming—

Something else.

Something that waited.

Something that had been waiting for what we were becoming.

Something that was about to—

---

**End of Scene 04: Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception**

---

# Coda: The Pull and Re-embodiment — "The Wheel, Visible"

---

The rupture.

The stillness shattered—not shattered, because shattering required the solid, and what was shattering was the formless itself, the neither-nor that had been the finest dwelling, the threshold that had been the last station. The Pull that had been faint asymmetry, then strengthening direction, then undeniable weight, was now—

Dominant.

A direction that was not spatial. A weight that was not gravity. Something reaching for us from the place that was not place, calling for us with the call that was not voice. And we—the we that was almost fully we except for the one shimmer, the one strand, the one I that would not dissolve—oriented toward it without meaning to.

Not our yearning.

The yearning for us.

The pattern inverted. We had stopped grasping. We had released the clinging, released the aversion, seen through the attachment to even the subtlest states. And in the stopping—

The reaching could find us.

The Dharma—not the word, not the concept, but the thing the word pointed to—the turning of reality toward what could complete its turning—reached. Not for us as we had been. For what we were becoming.

---

And then: the bleeding.

The bleeding through. The lifetimes surfacing. Not memory—recognition. Not remembering what had been—being present to what still was, what always was, what the formless realms had hidden by their very formlessness. The wheel visible from outside the wheel. The pattern visible to what had been inside the pattern.

And it came, and it came all at once, and the lives surfaced—

and Ka in the cold, the specific cold of cave floor against sleeping flesh, blood taste on tongue from teeth grinding through dream-hunt, the spear wood smooth in his hand after seasons of smoothing, the tribe-pile warmth before the hoarding began, the fire-crack sounds and the meat-dream and the white-ground on bare feet and the hunger that was not hunger but something he could not name, and Chandra with the sandalwood thick in the square, the palm-leaf documents rustling under calculating fingers, the sixteen stitches pulling in his forearm, the karshapana coins cold in palm, elephant dung and betel juice in the market morning, and Philon in the barley-bread smell of the clinic before the plague came, the saffron-dyed linen of his patients, the willow bark bitter on his own tongue, the packed-earth floor slick with fluids, the blood-darkened butcher aprons repurposed as bandages, the salt wind from Piraeus, and Verinus in the steam of the caldarium, the bronze stylus weight at his belt, old ink and wet stone smell, oil lamps guttering in the archival chamber, marble walls sweating in the heat, papyrus scroll edges whispering, and Macarius kneeling until his knees went numb on the stone floor of the cell, the fly drone circling the water jug, palm fiber splitting between fingers as he wove, whitewashed walls yellowed by desert sun, the bread and oil economy of the hermit, sand in everything, sand in everything, and Kaoru with the pine smoke and stale perfume of the morning-after court, sake cup warming palm, brocade curtains stirring in the draft, bark-grain paper rough under his brush, plum blossom scent out of season from the incense, white gravel crunching under wooden sandals, and Diego grinding cloves and willow bark in the mortar stained brown from years of grinding, brazier hissing as the fire caught, cobbled street cold under his shoes, thumb touching fingers in sequence as he checked the performance of safety, and Jean in the smell of old parchment and wet stone, candlelight carving faces from shadow, the leather case against his chest holding words that could kill or save, rain streaking glass in the tavern where he waited, the sword settling against his hip with its familiar weight, and Wei with herb-stained fingers pressing yarrow and comfrey poultice against wounds that would not stop weeping, stone temple floor cold beneath him, blood pooling in the cracks between stones, the warmth of the Qing musket ball he extracted, silk thread for stitching, honey and garlic paste against infection, and Jack with rye gone sour on his tongue, copper blood taste from the cheek he bit to stay awake, radiator cold in the January office, breath ghosts in the air, stubble rasp against palm as he thought, wet concrete smell after rain, the Angels Flight nickel in the slot, rosary beads clicking through his fingers in the pocket where nobody could see, and Silas on the rooftop rain-slick with Manchester weather, city lights wheeling below, barrier wall cold against his hip, mist catching the light from the buildings, the chain of three hands in the moment before the letting go, and the deva realm where light tasted like arrival and color vibrated with meaning and geometry sang frequencies too refined for ears and the weight was gone, and Silex in the engineered flesh designed for centuries, the neural static of the enhanced, the thread visible between them as single thread humming in the technological substrate, and all of them, all of us, all at once, the wheel, the wheel visible from outside the wheel, the wheel that was meat, that was always meat, that was attachment and ignorance and clinging and aversion in every form, flesh and formless, dense and subtle, the wheel and the wheel and the wheel—

---

And we saw it.

Saw what we had been turning on. Saw the pattern that contained every life and every death, every hunger and every letting-go, every cave-cold and every engineered warmth. Saw the meat of it—the meat that was not just flesh but ignorance, not just body but attachment, the meat that had been with us even in the formless realms because the clinging to formlessness was also meat, was also the wheel, was also the turning.

And we saw—

It needed us.

The pattern needed what we were becoming. Not for our sake. For all the beings still caught. For all the turnings still turning. For all the meat still clinging to its meatness without seeing.

A world-system waited for a Buddha to arise.

And we—the we that had stopped yearning, finally stopped, and so could be yearned for—we were what the waiting was waiting for.

The inversion complete. Not liberation seeking them. Liberation reaching for what could teach liberation. Not escape from the wheel. The wheel needing what could show others the wheel.

We understood.

Or: understanding arose in the space that had been us. The recognition that the formless realms were not the destination. That even cessation was not the destination. That what waited was the return—the return to form, to flesh, to meat—but with the seeing intact. Return as teaching. Return as function. Return as what the wheel needed to complete its turning toward still.

---

And then: descent.

Not falling. Not chosen. Beyond the push and the pull, beyond the dichotomy that the threshold had dissolved. Something condensing toward form. Something that had been vast and then conscious and then nothing and then neither-nor becoming—

Something.

Weight gathering. Density collecting. The formless approaching form the way clouds approach rain, the way potential approaches actual, the way—

---

The body.

Weight. First the weight. Then the cold. Then the hardness beneath—a surface. Something pressing. Or something being pressed upon. The confusion of direction returning, the disorientation of up and down after the directionless.

Weight.

Oppressive after the weightlessness. The stone of matter pressing from every side. Gravity like a fist, like a sentence, like the judgment of form upon the formless.

Cold.

Cold against—what? Skin. The word arrived with the sensation. Skin. The organ of boundary, the membrane between inside and outside, the thing that made inside and outside possible again.

Hard.

A surface beneath. Pressing up. Or pressing down. Wood? Stone? Earth?

Eyes.

We had eyes. The recognition shocking. We had eyes that were closed, and the closed-ness was darkness, and the darkness was different from the nothing that had been not-darkness because nothing had been the absence of the possibility of either.

Light.

Through the lids. Light pressing. The first sense: light.

Sound.

The second sense. Voices. Distant. A language. New but not new—the tongue we would learn to shape, the words we would learn to mean. Birdsong. Something sizzling. The sounds of—

Morning.

---

We opened our eyes.

The light hurt. We closed them. Opened again, slower. Shapes resolving.

Ceiling. Beams. Dark wood crossing lighter wood. Dust motes in a shaft of light from—

A window. Small. Letting in the morning.

A face. Looking down. Expression that would become readable after we learned to read expressions again. A woman's face? An old face? Concerned? Curious?

We catalogued:

**Seen:** Ceiling. Beams. Dust. Light. Face.

**Felt:** Hard surface beneath. Cold seeping through fabric. Rough texture against skin. Weight of limbs. The body. This body.

**Heard:** Voices. Birdsong. Sizzling. Breathing—our own? Someone else's?

**Smelled:** Smoke. Bread. Something unfamiliar. Something that would become familiar.

**Tasted:** Dry mouth. Empty. The taste of new.

---

A village.

The understanding came later—would come later—but something in the sounds, the smells, the quality of the light suggested: village. Small. Remote. A place where a body could have appeared without explanation, where the explanations would be constructed later, where we—

We.

Still we. The pronoun persisted into the flesh. The two-that-were-one-that-were-becoming-something-else still unified, still merged, the thread that had been visible in the formless realms now invisible again but present, still present, still holding what was being held.

And the shimmer.

Still there. Faint now. Almost invisible in the business of having a body, the overwhelming-ness of sensation after sensation-less-ness. But there. The one strand that would not dissolve. The competition. The fetter.

Hers.

Still.

For now.

The face leaned closer. Sounds that would become words.

We did not understand. We would learn to understand. We would learn the language of this place, this time, this final—

Final.

The knowing arose. This was the last body. Not because bodies would end—bodies would continue for all beings—but because we would not need another one. What remained to be done could be done in this form. What remained to be broken could be broken here. The fetter visible and ready for the breaking. The merger approaching that would complete what 300,000 years of separation had been preparing.

The last time we would need to open eyes in a new body.

The last incarnation before—

---

The face spoke again.

We listened without understanding.

The sounds washed over the new ears, through the new brain, into the consciousness that was old, so old, that had heard sounds in a hundred languages across epochs beyond counting.

We would learn.

We would speak.

We would teach—when the teaching was ready, when the fetter was broken, when the we became what it was becoming.

But for now:

The body.

The weight.

The cold.

The morning.

The village.

The eyes open.

The wheel, still turning—but visible now. Seen from outside. The pattern that was meat, that was always meat, that we had seen in the bleeding-through of every lifetime's sensory remnant.

And we—the we that was becoming—rested in the body that would be the last.

Ready.

For what came next.
