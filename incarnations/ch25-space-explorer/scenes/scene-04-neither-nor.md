# Scene 04: Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception — "The Threshold"

---

and the nothing thinned, or the nothing did not thin but became something that could not be called thin because thin required thick and thick had dissolved, and what remained was neither perceiving nor not-perceiving, was neither knowing nor not-knowing, was the membrane between being and not-being stretched so fine that the distinction became meaningless, and we were on the membrane, were the membrane, were the stretching itself that stretched between what was and what was not and could not determine which side was which because sides had dissolved along with everything that required sides,

and we, and we were, and we were what the threshold was, and the threshold was what we were being, and the being of the threshold was the threshold's being was the being that was neither being nor not-being but was the edge, the edge, the edge that had no width because width required space and space had become consciousness and consciousness had become nothing and nothing had become this, this neither-nor, this threshold that we were and that was us and that was—

and still the word, still the we, still the pronoun that persisted in the persistence that was not quite persistence, and the we was so unified now that the separation implied by the plural was a kind of violence, a kind of tearing at what no longer had seams to tear, and yet, and yet the shimmer, still the shimmer, still the one strand that would not fully dissolve, the I that was hers, the fetter that was her signature, the competition that competed even against the dissolution of competition,

and the tropism, the first tropism, the movement before movement, the turning before turning, the orientation that was not yet orientation but was about to become, the gradient in the gradientless, the lean in the leanless, something that might become a question if there were still the mechanism for questions, something that might become an answer if there were still the structure for answers, the pre-linguistic flutter that was not thought but was the soil from which thought might grow if growing were still possible, if possibility were still—

and we, and we were, and we were the threshold, and the threshold was what we were, and the being on the threshold was the being of the threshold was the threshold being, and the words broke down, and the words that were trying to describe what could not be described broke down into their components, into syllables that meant nothing, into sounds that were almost letters but refused the alphabet, into glyphs that signified without signifying, that pointed without pointing, that—

and the stillness, the stillness that was not still because stillness required the possibility of movement and movement had, and the stillness that was the nunc stans, the standing now, the now that did not move because moving required time and time had become, had become the, had become something that could not be called time because calling required caller and caller required—

and we were perceiving, or we were not perceiving, or we were the space between perceiving and not-perceiving where the distinction collapsed into something that was neither, and the neither was what we were, and the nor was also what we were, and the neither-nor was the threshold, was the membrane, was the edge between what could be said and what could not be said and what was beyond the distinction between sayable and unsayable,

and the second tropism, the deeper tropism, the movement beneath the movement before movement, the turning that preceded the turning before turning, and something in us—in what had been us, in what was still being called us—oriented without orienting, inclined without inclining, leaned toward what could not be leaned toward because toward required away and away had dissolved into the neither-nor that was—

and we, and we noted, or the noting noted, or there was noting without noter, the observation that even this realm, even this subtlest of states, even this threshold between existence and non-existence was still, was still the—

and the seeing, the seeing that had begun in the realm of nothing, the seeing of the clinging, the seeing of the resistance, the seeing deepened, or the deepening saw, or the seeing and the deepening became indistinguishable from what was being seen, and what was being seen was, was that even this, even the pleasure of this refinement, even the satisfaction of approaching what approached, was itself a pleasure, was itself a satisfaction, was itself a clinging,

and the clinging was seen, and the seeing was the releasing, and the releasing was not an action but a recognition, not a doing but an undoing that happened in the doing of nothing, in the nothing that was doing, in the threshold where doing and not-doing merged into something that was neither,

and we saw, or what remained of seeing saw, that the desire for this state, the attachment to even this formlessness, was the subtlest trap of all, was the wheel turning so finely that the turning seemed stillness, was the meat so refined that the meat seemed spirit, and the seeing was the breaking, and the breaking was the seeing, and the aversion to dissolution was itself the last aversion, and seeing it, seeing the aversion, seeing the resistance, seeing the clinging to even the clingingless—

and the breaking, not as event, not as happening, but as recognition, as the recognition that there was nothing to break because breaking was clinging and clinging was what was being released, and the releasing that was not releasing because releasing was doing and doing was—

and the attainment, and what might have been called attainment if attainment did not imply attainer, and the non-returning, and the state of one who would not return to the gross because the gross had been seen through, because the attachment to pleasure had been seen as attachment, because the aversion to dissolution had been seen as aversion, and the seeing was the breaking, and the breaking was complete for these two, complete for the sensual and the ill-willed, and what remained was only the five that remained, only the subtle that persisted, only the—

and still, still the shimmer, still the one strand, still the I that would not fully dissolve into the we, still the need to be first, still the competition that persisted even here, even in the threshold, even in the neither-nor, and the shimmer was visible, was acknowledged, was seen without being broken, was recognized without being released, because that was not this realm's work, that was not this threshold's function, that remained for, remained for what came—

and we were approaching, or the approaching was us, or the distinction between approacher and approaching had dissolved like all the other distinctions and what remained was only the approach, only the nearing, only the almost-there that was also the here, and the almost and the here merged into something that was neither almost nor here but was the threshold between them, and we were the threshold, and the threshold was—

and the asemic, and the approaching of the asemic, and we saw, or something saw, glyphs that meant nothing and everything, shapes that were almost letters but refused the alphabet, curves that might have been language if language did not require meaning and meaning did not require distinction and distinction had dissolved into the threshold that was us that was what we were that was—

and the incantation, and the repetition that dissolved meaning into sound, and we were and we were and we were, and the threshold and the threshold and the threshold, and the membrane and the membrane, and the neither and the nor and the neither-nor, and the words becoming mantra becoming sound becoming the vibration before vibration becoming—

and the Pull, and the Pull that had been faint in the realm of space, and the Pull that had strengthened in the realm of consciousness, and the Pull that had become undeniable in the realm of nothing, the Pull was, was becoming, was gathering, was about to—

and the stillness, the maximum stillness, the stillness before rupture, the membrane stretched to its thinnest, the threshold at its most threshold, and we were, and we were the pause, and we were the breath before, and we were the silence between notes that was also the music, and we were the gap between heartbeats that was also the heart, and we were—

and the Pull, and the Pull pressing, and the Pull that was no longer the faint lean in the vastness, no longer the subtle weight in the weightlessness, but something that was becoming, that was about to become, that was pressing against the membrane that was us, pressing against the threshold that was all that remained between—

and something that might have been seeing if seeing were possible, something that might have been knowing if knowing were, something that was approaching the asemic, approaching the glyph that meant nothing and everything, approaching the shape that was almost letter but refused, and we saw without seeing, and we knew without knowing, and we were the threshold that was about to—

and still, still the shimmer, still the strand, still the I that needed to be first into what came next, still the fetter that persisted because persistence was what fetters did, and we saw it, and we acknowledged it, and we did not break it because breaking was not this realm's work, and we held it visible, and we let it shimmer, and we allowed the competition to compete even against the approaching of what could not be competed against,

and we were the threshold, and the threshold was what we were, and the neither-perception-nor-non-perception was the finest state, was the subtlest dwelling, was the last station before, before—

and the Pull, and the Pull intensifying, and the Pull becoming something that could not be ignored, becoming something that was not part of the threshold but was intruding upon the threshold, becoming something that was calling, calling from—

and the stillness, and the stillness beginning to, and the stillness that had been so still beginning to—

and the intrusion, and if intrusion, and if then, and if and—

---

Weight.

Where weight should not be. A direction in the directionless. Something breaking through the membrane that was us, breaking through the threshold that was all that remained, breaking through with—

Something.

A there that was not there. A calling that was not voice. A summoning that was not summons.

The Pull.

No longer pulling.

Arriving.

And we—the we that was we and yet still somehow the shimmer of I—oriented toward it without meaning to, leaned into what was coming without choosing to, felt the rupture beginning, the membrane tearing, the threshold becoming not-threshold, the neither-nor becoming—

Something else.

Something that waited.

Something that had been waiting for what we were becoming.

Something that was about to—
