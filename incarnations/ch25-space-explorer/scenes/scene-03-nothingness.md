# Scene 03: Nothingness — "What Remains When Everything Goes"

---

The consciousness dissolved.

No. Unsay. The consciousness did not dissolve. Consciousness was not thing to dissolve. Rather: the taking of consciousness as object ended. The focus that had focused on the knowing that knew itself knowing released its focus. What remained was not consciousness. What remained was the absence of the object that consciousness had been.

Say void.

No. Void implies space. Void implies emptiness that could be filled.

Say absence.

Closer. Absence. The is-not that is not the is-not of something. The nothing that is not the nothing of before-something or after-something. The nothing that simply—

Is.

No. Wrong. "Is" belongs to being. "Is" presupposes existence. This was not existence. This was the absence of the category that would contain existence.

Try again.

Fail again.

Fail better.

---

We.

The word. Still the word. We had thought—no, thinking was also object, also released—we had been in a configuration that used the word "we" and the word persisted. Persisted in what? In the absence that was not absence because absence was still—

Unsay.

Start again.

Something remained.

Not consciousness. Not vastness. Not even the intertwining that had characterized the realm before this realm. Something thinner. Something that could not be stripped further. Or—

Could it?

The question arose and dissolved. The question that was about to reveal something about what was doing the questioning, about the questioner who still persisted in the non-persistence, about the—

We.

The word.

Still.

---

The absence had no quality.

Call it dark. No. Dark requires the possibility of light.

Call it still. No. Still requires the possibility of movement.

Call it cold. No. Cold requires the possibility of—

The absence of the possibility of quality. The absence of the absence of the presence of—

Worse. Better. Try again.

Nothing remained.

No. Unsay. Nothing remaining implies something that was remaining as nothing. Nothing implies the category of something against which nothing is defined. There was not nothing.

There was not something.

There was not the absence of the distinction between nothing and something.

There was—

Unsay.

---

Say awareness.

No. Too much. Say the trace of awareness. No. Trace implies presence. Say the absence of the absence of awareness.

Worse.

Better.

On.

---

We observed.

No. Observation requires observer and observed. Observation requires the separation that had dissolved in the realm before and had dissolved further in this—

We noted.

No. Noting requires one who notes. One implies boundary. Boundary implies—

There was a registering. Something registered. The registering was not separate from what was registered. The registering was not distinguishable from the—

Registered: absence.

Registered: the not-there of there.

Registered: the stripping.

The stripping of consciousness from consciousness. The removal of object from subject until subject was revealed as also object and removed. The paring. The worsening. The failing toward less and less and—

Less.

---

Still the word: we.

Examine the word. The word implies multiplicity. The word implies boundary between the ones who constitute the we. But boundary had dissolved. Multiplicity had dissolved. What persisted that still required the word?

Something.

Not two things. Two things required twoness.

Not one thing. One thing required oneness.

Something that was not the twoness or the oneness but that still—

Required.

The word we.

---

The nothing revealed.

This was the function of nothing. To reveal. The nothing was the draining of the pool. The nothing was the evaporation of the water. The nothing was what remained when the water was gone, and what remained—the sediment, the residue, the deposit at the bottom—became visible precisely because the water that had hidden it was no longer there to hide it.

What had the consciousness hidden?

What had the bliss concealed?

What had the intertwining kept from view?

The nothing answered. The nothing revealed.

---

The Pull.

Undeniable now.

A weight in the weightlessness. A direction in the directionlessness. Something that was not the nothing, calling from the nothing, or calling through the nothing, or—

Calling.

The word. The experience behind the word. The sense of being oriented toward when orientation should have been impossible. The sense of being wanted when wanting should have been—

Wanted.

The word cracked something open.

The registering registered: want persisted. In the nothingness, want persisted. Want should not have persisted. Want was clinging. Want was the wheel. Want was—

We wanted.

The admission. The recognition. In the nothing, the want was visible as it had not been visible in the consciousness, in the bliss, in the intertwining. The nothing stripped the covering. The nothing revealed the remnant.

We wanted.

But what?

---

The stripping continued.

Not the stripping of flesh. Flesh had been stripped long ago, in the realm of space, in the passage from designed bodies to formlessness.

Not the stripping of consciousness. Consciousness had been released in the passage from the bliss to this.

The stripping of the stripper.

The question: who strips? Who observes the stripping? Who registers the registration?

The question was itself the stripping. The asking was the paring. The "who" dissolved even as it asked, and what remained after the "who" dissolved was—

What?

---

Not what.

Unsay "what."

"What" implies thing. "What" implies category. "What" implies the possibility of answer.

There was no answer.

There was only the question dissolving.

There was only the questioner dissolving.

There was only—

The fetter.

---

The fetter.

The word arrived. Not from the traditions we did not name. Just the word. Fetter. That which binds. That which remains when everything else is stripped.

The fetter became visible.

Not visible as image. Not visible as concept. Visible as the thing-that-was-still-clinging when clinging should have been impossible. The attachment that the nothing revealed by being nothing. The sediment at the bottom of the drained pool.

We saw it.

No. Unsay. There was no we to see. There was no it to be seen. There was only the recognition—recognition without recognizer—that something still clung.

Competition.

The word. Hers. The word that characterized the twenty-five lifetimes of—

*I wanted to be first.*

The fracture. Not like the fractures in the realm before. Sharper. More honest. The I that would not dissolve because the I needed to be the one who dissolved first.

*I wanted to achieve this before—*

Before what? Before whom? The formlessness had no other to be before. The nothing had no race to win. And yet—

*I wanted.*

The want. The I. The want of the I that wanted to be the first to want nothing. The competition that competed even against competition. The fetter that was fettered to its own unfettering.

We.

The word. But the fracture did not fully seal. The I lingered. The I that was hers—had been hers—across the lifetimes when she had intervened, resisted, competed, needed to be the one who—

The I.

Still.

---

Say the clinging that remained.

Desire for fine-material existence. No. Simpler. The wanting of form, even subtle form.

Desire for formless existence. No. Simpler. The wanting of formless, even this formless.

The conceit. The I am. The I that persisted.

Restlessness. The agitation. The something-should-be-happening.

Ignorance. The not-seeing of what was being seen.

Five.

Remaining.

Even here. Even in the nothing. Even after the stripping had stripped everything that could be stripped except—

Except these.

Except the I that held them.

Except the competition that needed to be first to release them.

---

*I wanted to be first into the nothing.*

The words. Surfacing. Not as thought—thought had been stripped. As the thing-beneath-thought. The tropism. The orientation of consciousness toward completion and the need to complete before—

*Before you.*

The fracture deepened. The I speaking to a you. The we cracked into its components. For how long? Duration had dissolved. But the separation persisted beyond what should have been its persistence.

*I have been faster. Always faster. Twenty-five lives of faster. And now, in the nothing, I want—*

The want.

Visible.

Not hidden by flesh. Not hidden by consciousness. Not hidden by bliss. The nothing hid nothing. The nothing revealed.

*I want to be the one.*

The competition. The fetter. The last clinging that would not let go because letting go would mean—what? Losing? Losing to whom? There was no whom to lose to. There was no race. There was only the nothing and the want and the—

*I.*

The word.

Persisting.

---

The seeing.

Something saw the want. Something registered the competition. Something noted—without noter—that the fetter was fetter.

And the seeing was itself—

Breaking.

Not breaking as shattering. Breaking as the breaking of attachment. Breaking as the releasing of grip. Breaking as the fetter recognizing itself as fetter and, in the recognition, loosening.

The attachment to pleasure. Seen. The bliss had been pleasant. The pleasantness had been clung to. The clinging was visible now. The seeing stripped the clinging of its invisibility.

The resistance to dissolution. Seen. The fear of the nothing. The aversion that arose as the stripping stripped. The resistance was visible now. The seeing stripped the resistance of its hiddenness.

Sensual desire. Seen.

Ill will. Seen.

Not as words. Not as concepts. As the experiences that the words pointed to. As the clinging and the resisting that had characterized all the lifetimes, all the bodies, all the turnings of the—

Wheel.

The word. Too soon for the word. But the word arrived anyway. The wheel that was turning. The wheel that was meat. The wheel that was—

No. Not yet. Not quite.

But seen. Beginning to be seen. The pattern that the nothing revealed by being nothing. The attachment and the aversion that the nothing made visible by stripping everything that was not attachment and aversion.

---

*I am afraid.*

The fracture. Another I. Another surfacing.

*I am afraid to dissolve.*

The admission. The honesty that the nothing required. The nowhere-to-hide that the nothing provided.

*I am afraid that if I dissolve, I will have lost. Lost the race I have been running for longer than running has existed. Lost to—*

*To whom?*

The question. Ours. The we that still persisted, asking the I that still surfaced.

*To you. To the other. To the one who might dissolve first and leave me behind and—*

*There is no behind. There is no first.*

We.

The we speaking to the I. The we that was cracked but still we, addressing the fetter that was visible but still fetter.

*The race was never real. The competition was never—*

*But I wanted it. I needed it. It was all I—*

We.

The fracture healing. But slower. The I subsiding but not disappearing. The fetter acknowledged but not broken.

Not yet.

Almost.

---

The Pull.

Stronger.

Weight in the weightlessness. Direction in the directionlessness. Something calling from the place that was not place. Something reaching for what remained after the stripping.

We oriented.

No. The orienting happened. There was no we to orient. There was only the leaning, the inclining, the gradient toward—

Toward what?

The question arose and dissolved. The question that implied a what to be toward. The question that implied destination. The question that—

The Pull did not answer.

The Pull simply pulled.

And what remained—the we that was we only in the sense that the word persisted, the I that was I only in the sense that the fetter persisted—leaned.

---

Stripped.

The word. The state. The condition of having been stripped until only stripping remained.

The nothing went on. Or: the nothing did not go on, because going required time and time had—

The nothing.

The fetter.

The seeing.

The approaching.

We were approaching something. Or something was approaching us. Or the distinction between approacher and approached had dissolved like all the other distinctions and what remained was only—

Only the approach.

Only the nearing.

Only the almost-there that preceded the there.

---

We—if we.

If still we.

If the word still meant.

We waited.

No. Waiting implies anticipation. Implies future. Implies—

We were.

No. Were implies existence. Implies—

Unsay.

The nothing continued.

The fetter persisted.

The Pull strengthened.

And somewhere—in the direction that was not direction, in the place that was not place—something waited for what was almost ready to see. For what was almost ready to break. For what was almost—

Almost.

The word.

The word that meant not-yet but soon.

The word that meant the fetter visible, acknowledged, almost broken.

The word that meant the next realm approaching.

Almost.
