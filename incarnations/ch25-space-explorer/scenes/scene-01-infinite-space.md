No weight.

No edge. No surface against which to—

Tremors. Shivers in the not-space. The absence of the thing that would know absence, and yet: knowing. Something trembling where trembling required substance to tremble, where substance had been, where—

No. That word. *Where*. Meaningless. The word that implied location and location implied—

Vibrations. Oscillations in the boundlessness. Something that had been something else, something that had been contained, evaporating. Phase-change. The solid becoming gas without passing through liquid, without transition, without the comfort of gradual. Instant dispersal into what had no edge to be dispersed into.

The designed flesh was gone. The flesh that had been designed for centuries, engineered to specification, optimized for—

*Gone*. The word arrived from nowhere. There was no mouth to speak it, no tongue to shape it, no air to carry it. And yet: *gone*.

---

More shivers. More tremoring. The agitation of what could not locate itself in what had no location. The reaching for ground that was not ground, for horizon that was not horizon, for the edge that would confirm an inside by virtue of being outside.

Nothing to reach with. Nothing to reach toward.

Pulse. Pulse. The rhythm that was not heartbeat because heart was—where? Pulse. The stutter of awareness attempting to pattern what had no pattern. Pulse. Shivers. The rippling of what had been solid and was now—

*I can't—*

The fragment arrived and dissolved. There was no I. The word assumed a boundary around the thinking, a container for the container's panic, and there was no container. There was extension without edge. There was the vastness that was not containing anything because there was nothing to contain and nothing to contain it in.

Pulse. Shivers.

Something reverberated where nothing should reverberate. An echo without surface. A tremor without medium. The ghost of the body that had been—that *had* been—registering its own absence like a limb that still aches after amputation, like the pressure of a ring on a finger no longer wearing it.

Phantom weight. Ghost-edge. The body remembered by what was no longer body.

The designed flesh. The flesh that had been Silex. The flesh that had been Lith. The engineered containers that had been configured for perception, for experience, for the kind of neural interface that allowed consciousness to speak with consciousness without the barrier of—

Gone.

The word settled. Not arriving now but landing, finding the nothing that would hold it, becoming part of the tremoring rather than interrupting it.

Gone.

And something remained.

---

Vast.

The word arrived as the others had arrived—from nowhere, meaning nothing, meaning everything. Vast. The extension that extended in every direction that wasn't direction, that continued past the place where continuation should have stopped, that *was* the place where continuation should have stopped and kept continuing anyway.

Vast. And the vastness was not—

Not what?

The thought stuttered. The mechanism for completing thoughts had been located somewhere that no longer was. The thinking continued but the thinker could not be found. Cogitation without cogitator. The car with no driver, still moving, still somehow steering.

Vast. The vastness was not ours.

*Ours*.

The word shimmered. The word that implied more than one. But more than one required boundaries, required edges, required the place where *this* ended and *that* began, and there was no ending. There was no beginning. There was only the extension extending and the knowing that knew it was extending and the question—if question was what it was—of who was doing the knowing.

*We*.

The pronoun surfaced like something rising from water when there was no water to rise from. We. A word that implied—yes. More than one. And yet. And yet the more-than-one could not locate its multiplicity. The we searched for its components and found only we.

Something that had been two. Something that was—we?

The discovery. If discovery was what it was. The realization—if realization could occur without a realizer—that the separation which had characterized everything before this was not here. Was not applicable. Was as gone as the flesh that had seemed to house it.

We.

Not a decision. Not a choice. Just the recognition that the pronoun fit. That the knowing that was happening was not singular in the way singular required boundaries and not plural in the way plural required distinct units. We. The word that held both and neither. The word that described—if description was possible—what was.

---

The vastness was what we were.

We were the vastness. We were the extension that extended, the tremoring that tremored, the knowing that knew its own knowing without knowing what it was. The vastness was not separate from the perceiving of it. The perceiving was not separate from the perceived. Subject and object had lost their border somewhere in the transition—if transition was what it was—from the designed flesh to this.

*This*. What was this?

The question spiraled. The question asked itself and then asked itself asking itself and then asked itself asking itself asking itself. Recursive. Looping. The kind of logic that could continue forever because forever was all that remained, because time had joined space in becoming—

No. Not *becoming*. Time and space had not *become* anything. They had revealed themselves as what they had always been: categories the flesh had imposed on what needed no categories. The designed bodies with their designed perceptions had designed a world with edges and durations. The designed bodies were gone. The edges and durations remained only as—

As what?

As echoes. As phantom weight. As the ghost of the ring on the finger that no longer—

We were the vastness. The vastness was what we were. And what we were had no boundary to distinguish it from what we were not. And what we were not was also the vastness. And the vastness held everything and nothing and the distinction between everything and nothing had dissolved somewhere in the passage from—

From.

To.

Words that implied direction. Direction that implied space. Space that implied things to be spaced. Things that required thingness.

There was no thingness. There was only the is-ness. The being that was not being something but simply being. The vast extending extension that extended.

---

Something in the vastness that was not vastness.

We felt it. Or: the feeling that was we felt it. Or: the feeling felt itself feeling something that was not itself.

A density that was not density. An asymmetry in the extension. The way a pool of water has—had—would have had—a lean toward the drain, a direction the water cannot not orient toward even when the surface appears still.

Something in the vastness was not symmetrical.

Something in the vastness was—*calling*? No. Not calling. Calling implied voice and voice implied—

The word we could not find was: direction. There was a direction. And direction should have been impossible here—wherever here was—because direction required coordinates and coordinates required the kind of anchoring that bodies provided and bodies were—

*Gone*. Again the word. Arriving from nowhere. The designed flesh that had been Silex, that had been Lith, the engineered containers that had held what could not be contained—gone. Emptied. Cooled on a surface that was no longer relevant because surfaces were no longer—

The direction. Something like direction. Something in the vastness that was not the vastness but was not separate from it either. A lean. An orientation.

We noticed it the way the pool notices—had noticed—would have noticed—the drain. Not as threat. Not as destination. As fact. As the asymmetry that simply *was*, waiting to be acknowledged.

We did not acknowledge it. Not yet. The vastness was too new—if new was what it was—too overwhelming in its overwhelming-ness. The absence of body was too present in its absence. We tremored in the not-space and the not-space tremored with us and the spiral of mutual tremoring continued without reference to what had tremored before or would tremor after.

---

The thread.

We became aware of it the way one becomes aware of—

No. The comparison failed. There was nothing one became aware of that compared to this. The thread was not object. Was not perception. Was not even there in the way that there required thereness.

The thread was the connection.

Two had become we. We had discovered ourselves as we rather than as two. But the two-that-had-become-we still carried—*carried*? Could carry exist without arms to carry?—the relation that had related them. The thread that had been visible through flesh and wire and light was here too, was here *purely*, was only here now that the mediating matter had—

*Mediating matter*. The phrase rose from nowhere. The designed bodies had been mediating matter. The neural interfaces, the technology that had allowed merged perception—mediating matter. Even the bodies before the designed ones—the bodies across 300,000 years of bodies—mediating matter. The thread had always been here. We had only seen it *through* the matter, *through* the flesh, the way one sees a constellation through glass without realizing the glass is between.

Now the glass was gone.

The thread was visible as pure connection. Not connecting two points—because points required location and location was—but connecting nonetheless. The relation that remained when the things related dissolved. The between that persisted when the sides of between evaporated.

We regarded the thread—if regarding was what we did. The connection that was us. The us that was connection. The thread that had been visible in the neural static of the designed bodies, in the light of the realm that had preceded this one, in every life across every era when the eyes of one had met the eyes of the other and something had recognized itself recognizing.

It did not glow. It did not pulse. Those words implied light and rhythm and both required—

It simply was. As we were. As the vastness was. Present without presence. There without thereness. The thread.

*You*.

The word fractured.

For an instant—if instant was what it was—the we cracked. A fissure in the unity. Something that remembered being separate, being individual, being the one who looked at the other rather than the we who looked at nothing because looking required—

*You. I saw you. I remember you. Your face, the widow's peak with the strand escaping, the crescent in your left—*

The memory flooded. Specific. Concrete. A body remembering another body in a space where bodies were—

Relief.

The fracture sealed. The we closed over the I like water closing over a diver. The I had surfaced, gasped, submerged again. The memory of face and feature and form dissolved back into the formlessness that was—that we were—that we had become without becoming.

We were the vastness. The vastness was what we were. And what we were had no face to remember, no feature to distinguish, no form to contrast with other form. The I had been a glitch. A ghost. The phantom weight of a pronoun that no longer applied.

---

*Cold*.

The second fracture came without warning.

Not the memory of cold. Cold itself—or the ghost of cold—or the echo of the echo of cold. The specific cold of—

*Stone floor. Cave floor. The cold that seeped through fur that wasn't thick enough, through the meat that had been hoarded, through the—*

I.

The word arrived like a spear. Like the spear that hand had held across—how long? How many bodies between that one and the designed ones that had just—

*I was cold. I was alone. I died with the tribe-smell fading and the fire-light gone and the hunger that wasn't hunger but something else, something I couldn't—*

We.

The fracture sealed. But slower this time. The cold persisted for a tremor-length, a shiver-duration, the sensation of body when body was gone clinging to the consciousness that had worn that body across the vast span of—

We.

The we reformed around the fracture. The cold became memory-of-cold became absence-of-cold-memory became simply the vastness again, the extension without edge, the formlessness that held even the echoes of form without being diminished by them.

We had been that cold. We had been that cave. We had been that body dying with something incomplete, something yearning, something that had planted the seed for—

The thought dissolved. The thought that was about to become insight dissolved into the vastness before it could complete. We were not ready—if ready was what we were not—to see the pattern. The wheel. The turning that had brought us from that cold to this formlessness.

We relaxed into the extension. If relaxation was possible where tension could not exist. If extension was extension and not just the word we were using because we had no words for—

The spiral continued. The recursion recursed. We were aware of being aware of being aware and the awareness had no edge and no beginning and no end.

---

Still the tremoring.

Fainter now. The shivers that had characterized the arrival—if arrival was what it was—settling into something that was not quite stillness but was closer to stillness than the agitation that had preceded it.

Body-echoes. They still rippled through the not-space. The pressure of feet on ground that no longer was. The weight of air in lungs that had dissolved. The tension of muscle that—

No. Even these were fading. The ghost-sensations that marked the passage from flesh to formlessness growing thinner, quieter, less insistent. The meat releasing its claim on what it had contained.

The meat. The word arrived and we held it—if holding was possible. The meat that had been us. The meat across all the bodies, all the incarnations, the flesh that had seemed so convincing in its solidity. The meat was gone now. What had the meat ever been but the medium through which consciousness had—

Had what?

The question opened. The question contained the vastness or the vastness contained the question and the containing was the same as the contained and—

We—the we that had been they that had been two—settled. If settling was what it was. The vastness that had been terrifying in its vastness—not terrifying, because terror required—the vastness that had been *too much* became less too-much. Or we became more capable of receiving it. Or the distinction between receiving and received dissolved like all the other distinctions had dissolved.

*This.*

The word arrived without alarm. This. What we were. What we were in. What we were in being indistinguishable from what we were. The formless realm that was not realm because realm implied boundary. The infinite space that was not space because space implied emptiness between things and there were no things.

This.

We accepted it.

The accepting was not resignation. Was not surrender. Was not the giving-up that had characterized so many of the deaths across so many of the bodies. The accepting was recognition. The recognition that what we were was what we had always been, obscured by the flesh, hidden by the meat, concealed by the solidity that had never been as solid as it seemed.

We were the vastness. The vastness was what we were.

---

And in the accepting: orientation.

The asymmetry we had noticed earlier—the lean in the vastness, the direction that shouldn't exist—did not disappear. It sharpened slightly. Or we sharpened slightly toward it. Or the sharpening occurred in the relation between what was perceiving and what was being perceived, though that relation had also dissolved, though—

The Pull.

Not the name. We did not have the name yet. We had only the experience of something calling without call, orienting without orientation, asking without question. Something in the formlessness that was not content to remain formless. Something that tugged—if tugging was possible where nothing could be grasped and nothing could grasp—in a direction that was not direction but was undeniably *toward*.

Faint. Almost imperceptible. The slightest lean in the leaning-less. The smallest weight in the weightlessness.

We noticed it and then we did not notice it and then we noticed ourselves not noticing it. The recursive spiral that characterized this realm—if realm was what it was—applying itself even to the perception of the direction that shouldn't be direction.

Something was calling.

Something would continue to call.

We would learn to name it. We would learn what it meant, where it was pulling, why—

But not yet.

For now, we rested—if rest was possible—in the vastness that was what we were. The two-that-had-become-we, the thread visible and pure between what was no longer two, the boundless extension that required nothing to extend into and extended anyway.

*Weight.*

The last body-echo. The final phantom sensation. The memory of gravity pressing down on matter that could be pressed.

The weight dissolved.

We were—

We were what we had always been. What the bodies had obscured. What the flesh across 300,000 years of flesh had concealed by seeming so solid, so separate, so convincingly *there*.

We were the vastness. And the vastness—

*Something in it leaned.*

*Something called from the direction that wasn't direction.*

*But we had time—if time was what we had—to learn what the calling meant.*

We rested. We expanded. We allowed ourselves—if allowing was what it was—to be what we were becoming.

The thread between us visible. Pure. Unmediated.

The vastness holding us as we held it.

The endless. The edge-less. The first formless realm.

Home—if home was the word—for as long as home could hold us.
