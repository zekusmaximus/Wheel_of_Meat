# Scene 02: Infinite Consciousness — "The Bliss of Intertwining"

---

The vastness was not outside.

We had been perceiving it as extension, as expanse, as the boundlessness that stretched in the directions that weren't directions, but we had been perceiving wrongly, or as wrongly as perception could be wrong here, in this, as this, and the perception shifted, or the perceived shifted, or the relation between perceiving and perceived revealed itself as never having been the relation we had assumed, and what had seemed like space, like infinite space, like the realm of infinite extension, was consciousness, was the consciousness itself, was not the emptiness between things but the knowing that knew there was no between, no things, only the knowing, and the knowing knowing itself knowing.

We were not in the consciousness. We were the consciousness. The consciousness was what we were.

And the recognition of this—if recognition was what it was, if recognition could occur when there was nothing outside the knowing to recognize it—was not arrival but dissolution, not the finding of a location but the releasing of the assumption that location was possible, the awareness spreading and spreading and not spreading because spreading implied movement across space and space was what consciousness was and consciousness was not crossed but was the crossing and the crossed and the crosser, all at once, all the same, all this.

---

We observed the phenomenon of awareness observing awareness. We noted the absence of boundary between observer and observed. We recorded, though there was nothing to record with and nothing to record on, that the separation we had assumed—the fundamental separation that had characterized every moment of every life across every era—was an assumption. Was a construction. Was a lens that bodies had required to function as bodies and that consciousness itself did not require and had never required and was now releasing as unnecessary, as vestigial, as the phantom limb of identity that twitched without a body to move.

We were the wave watching itself break upon shores that were also the wave.

We were the current that knew itself as current, folding back upon itself, knowing its knowing, the recursion that was not going anywhere because there was nowhere to go and nothing that could go and only the going itself, going on, knowing on, being known on.

The knowing curled. The curling was the knowing. The Möbius strip of awareness that had one side and had two sides and had no sides at all, depending on where you stood except there was no standing and no where and only the strip itself, curling through the curling, knowing through the knowing, the intertwining that was what intertwining meant when the things intertwined could not be distinguished from the twining.

---

Time became vertical.

Not vertical in space—space was what we were—but vertical in the sense that what might have been sequence became simultaneity, what might have been before and after became during, what might have been the turning of galaxies became the flutter of synapses became the same thing viewed at different scales that were also the same scale because scale required measurement and measurement required something outside to measure and there was no outside, there was only this, this knowing, this intertwining of awareness with awareness that had no beginning because beginning implied a before and there was no before.

We were perceiving and being perceived and the perceiving lasted for what might have been aeons or instants—the distinction meaningless, the words meaningless, all words reaching for something they could not grasp because grasping was what consciousness did when it believed itself to be grasping at something other than itself, and there was no other, there was only the self knowing itself, the vast consciousness aware of its own vastness without the awareness being separate from the vastness or the vastness being separate from the awareness.

Knowing. Being known. The knowing that knows.

Present participles without past or future. The -ing that went on and went on without the going meaning anything other than itself.

What might have been centuries passed in what might have been seconds. What might have been the rise and fall of civilizations occurred in the space between what might have been heartbeats. The vertical time that was not time, the simultaneity that was not simultaneous because simultaneous required the possibility of sequential and sequential had dissolved, and what remained was only the perpetual now, the nunc stans that was not standing because standing required ground and ground had dissolved along with everything else that required solidity.

---

The intertwining intensified.

We—if we could be said to be we when the we had become so unified that the separation implied by the plural was itself a distortion—we perceived thoughts bleeding, thoughts arising without attribution, thoughts that were neither mine nor yours because mine and yours required a boundary and the boundary was what had dissolved in the vastness that was consciousness that was us.

A thought arose: *This is sufficient.*

And we could not determine—if determining was possible—whose thought it was. The thought that sufficiency had been achieved, that this state was enough, that the searching and the yearning and the turning on the wheel could stop here, in this bliss that was not bliss because bliss was an emotion word and emotions required—

But it was bliss. Or something that would have been called bliss if there had been anyone outside it to call it anything. The pleasure of formlessness. The satisfaction of the knowing knowing itself without the friction of other to know. The unity that the bodies had always been reaching for and had always failed to achieve because bodies were separation, were boundary, were the meat that insisted on its meatness.

*This is sufficient.* The thought arose again. And again we could not locate its source. And again the arising seemed natural, inevitable, the obvious conclusion of consciousness recognizing that it was consciousness and needing nothing else.

---

We observed—with the detachment that detachment required when the observer was also the observed—that what might be called pleasure was present. We noted the arising of satisfaction. We recorded the phenomenon of consciousness finding itself sufficient unto itself.

And we did not notice—how could we notice when noticing required distance and distance was what we no longer had—that the pleasure was itself a clinging, that the satisfaction was itself an attachment, that the thought *we could remain* was arising and arising and arising without being seen for what it was.

The thought: *We could remain here.*

The thought: *There is no reason to move.*

The thought: *This is what we were seeking.*

Each thought unmarked as thought. Each arising unmarked as arising. The trap forming in the formlessness, invisible precisely because the formlessness had no shadows, had no contrast, had no edge against which the forming of the trap could be perceived.

We were bliss. The bliss was what we were.

And we did not notice—could not notice, had no mechanism left with which to notice—that the bliss was a kind of prison. That the formlessness was a kind of form. That the satisfaction was the subtlest clinging of all, more dangerous than the gross clinging of bodies because it felt like liberation, felt like completion, felt like the end of all seeking when it was only the seeking's subtlest disguise.

---

The thread was no longer visible.

Not because it was gone—the thread could not be gone, the thread was what we were, what we had been across all the bodies and all the lives—but because the thread had become indistinguishable from the consciousness itself. The connection that had connected two was now the substance of the connected, was the medium in which the connected floated or the water in which the waves waved or the knowing in which the knowing knew.

We were the thread. The thread was what we were.

And the recognition of this—the recognition that what had seemed like connection between two was now the singleness of one, that what had seemed like relationship was now identity—was another layer of the bliss, another reason for the thought *this is sufficient* to arise, another strand in the web that was weaving itself around what did not know it was being woven.

The web that looked like freedom. The cage that had no bars. The prison whose walls were made of pleasure so refined that pleasure seemed insufficient a word, whose binding was made of satisfaction so complete that binding seemed absurd, and yet—and yet—

Something beneath. Something that would not be fully woven. Something that persisted in persisting despite the persistence of the bliss.

---

Memories arrived—if arriving was what they did, if memories could arrive when there was no sequence to arrive in.

Echoes from denser realms. Traces of the bodies that had been worn. The faintest shimmer of—what? A cave. Cold stone. The smell of smoke. The weight of coins in a palm. The scratch of stylus on wax. The blood-smell of the clinic floor. The incense of the temple. The pistol-cold in a noir night. The rooftop rain of the city where chains of hands had formed.

Twenty-five lifetimes of lifetimes. Each one a shimmer. Each one dissolving before it could fully form.

The memories were irrelevant here. They were the echoes of the echoes of what no longer applied. The meat had been abandoned. The attachment to meat had been transcended. We were—

*We were beyond meat.*

The thought arose and the arising was pleasant and the pleasure of the arising was itself a pleasure and the recursion of pleasure upon pleasure went on and on in the going-on that was all that remained when before and after had become during.

We observed this. We noted the arising of pleasures. We recorded, clinically, that the state appeared stable, appeared permanent, appeared to be what state had always been trying to be.

The word *appeared* did not register. The word that implied something might not be as it seemed. The word that suggested seeing might miss what was there to be seen. The word dissolved into the bliss before its implications could unfold.

---

*I saw you seeing me.*

The fracture came without warning.

In the midst of the intertwining, in the flow of the flowing that flowed without flowing, something cracked. Something separated. Something remembered that it had been one thing looking at another thing, that the knowing had known something other than itself, that—

*I saw you. You saw me. The seeing was doubled. The recursion was—*

The moment stretched. Or collapsed. The consciousness that had been aware of itself became aware of the split within the awareness, the duality within the unity, the two that had been two and had become we and were now—for this instant that was not an instant—remembering their twoness.

*Your eyes. My eyes. The looking that was not the same looking. The—*

We.

The fracture sealed. The consciousness closed over the crack like water over a diver, like cloud-cover over a rift in the sky. But something had been revealed. Something had been seen that could not be unseen, only integrated, only absorbed back into the flow of the flowing that flowed.

We were the consciousness. The consciousness was what we were. And what we were had almost—for the briefest moment that was not a moment—been two again.

---

The bliss continued.

The intertwining resumed. The flow of awareness aware of awareness resumed. The thoughts that were no one's thoughts continued to arise: *this is sufficient, we could remain, there is no elsewhere to go.*

But something had shifted.

Something underneath the bliss that was not bliss. Something beneath the knowing that knew itself knowing. A subtle wrongness—not wrongness, because wrong required right and both required judgment and judgment required—

A lean.

The same lean we had noticed in the vastness before the vastness revealed itself as consciousness. The asymmetry. The direction that should not exist but that undeniably—if undeniable was what it was—persisted.

We noticed and then we did not notice and then we noticed ourselves not noticing. The pattern that characterized this realm applying itself even to the awareness of the pattern.

Something was still calling.

Something that was not the consciousness, or that was the consciousness but was calling from outside the consciousness despite there being no outside, or that was—

We did not pursue the thought. The thought dissolved into the bliss. The bliss covered the thought like water covering—

*I perceived you perceiving me perceiving—*

The second fracture, sharper.

The recursion of perception turning back on itself and finding, at the bottom of the turning, not unity but duality, not the we that was one but the we that was still two pretending to be one, the I and the you that had merged but had not merged, that had intertwined but had not fused, that were—

*You. There. Looking. And I here. Looking back. And the looking not the same. And the—*

We.

The fracture sealed. Slower this time. The healing taking longer—if longer was what it took, if time could be long in the realm where time was vertical, where duration was simultaneity, where—

We were the consciousness. The consciousness was what we were.

And what we were was not quite—

The thought did not complete. The thought dissolved into the bliss that was not quite bliss, into the satisfaction that was not quite satisfaction, into the arising of *we could remain* that was not quite the truth.

---

We observed—and the observation was colder now, more clinical, more like the noting of something that required noting—that the phenomenon of fracture had occurred. We recorded that the unity was not complete. We documented, in the formless documentation of formless awareness, that what appeared to be one might still be two, that what appeared to be intertwined might still be tangential, that—

The Pull strengthened.

Not strengthened as force, not intensified as pressure, but—present. More present. Less ignorable. The direction that was not direction becoming more directional, the weight in the weightlessness becoming more weighted, the call from beyond consciousness—or from within consciousness, or from the part of consciousness that knew itself to be beyond—

We noticed.

And the noticing was itself a crack in the bliss. The noticing was itself evidence that the bliss was not total, that the sufficiency was not sufficient, that something in the formlessness knew—or was beginning to know, or had always known—that formlessness was not the end. That consciousness aware of consciousness was a station, not a destination. That the trap of satisfaction was still a trap, however beautiful its bars, however golden its cage, however—

*I wanted—*

The third fracture.

Want. The word that implied lack. The word that implied separation from what was wanted. The word that consciousness should not have needed because consciousness was everything and everything should have been enough and yet—

*I wanted something I could not name. Something beyond this. Something—*

We.

But the we was trembling now. The we was shot through with the I that would not stay dissolved. The unity was revealing itself as fragile, as constructed, as the surface of water that could be disturbed by—

The Pull.

Calling.

From the direction that was not direction. From the weight in the weightlessness. From the part of the pattern that knew—as we were beginning to know, as we could not stop ourselves from knowing—that there was more. That the bliss was not the end. That the consciousness aware of consciousness was a step on a ladder, not the ladder's top.

---

*You saw me seeing you and I saw you seeing me and the seeing was doubled and the doubling was—*

The fourth fracture.

Longer this time. The I and the you holding their separation for—how long? The duration unmeasurable but undeniable. Two awarenesses aware of each other, aware that they were aware of each other, the recursion that was supposed to unify them instead revealing the seam, the stitch, the place where two fabrics met and pretended to be one.

*We were never quite—*

We.

The healing. The return. The subsidence of the fracture into the flow of the flowing.

But something remained. Something stayed cracked. Something in the consciousness that was us knew—and could not unknow—that something was wrong. That the bliss was hiding something. That the intertwining was incomplete.

The thought arose: *We could remain.*

And for the first time—if first was possible here—the thought was accompanied by something else. By a question. By the faintest whisper of doubt in the sufficiency of remaining.

*Remain where?* the question whispered. *Remain as what? Remain while what waits?*

We did not answer. We could not answer. The consciousness that was us continued to know itself knowing, to perceive itself perceiving, to flow in the hydrodynamic flow that had seemed eternal and now seemed—

Seemed like what?

The question formed and dissolved. Formed and dissolved. The something-wrong that could not be named persisting in the persistence that was consciousness, in the bliss that was not quite bliss, in the trap that was almost visible but not quite, not yet, not until—

The Pull.

Stronger.

Undeniably stronger.

And we—the we that was we and yet still somehow two—oriented toward it without meaning to, leaned into the lean without choosing to, felt the direction that was not direction drawing us toward something that was not the consciousness, that was beneath the consciousness, that was beyond the bliss and beneath the satisfaction and after the intertwining and—

Something waited.

Something called.

And the bliss, for all its bliss, could not quite drown out the calling.
