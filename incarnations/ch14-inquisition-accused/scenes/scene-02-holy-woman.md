# Scene 2: The Holy Woman

---

Evening came early in autumn, the sun sliding behind Toledo's western walls and leaving the streets in premature dusk. Diego walked through the converso quarter with his medical bag against his side, its leather strap cutting a familiar groove into his shoulder. The narrow lanes smelled of cooking fires and waste, of lives compressed into too-small spaces where neighbors knew too much about each other and silence was the only privacy anyone possessed.

He had not gone to Tomás's house. Inés's warning had been clear, and caution had served him well through forty-three years of performing safety. But the unease sat in his chest like undigested bread, heavy and sour, and so he walked instead—past the shuttered shops, past the fountain where women gathered to wash clothes and exchange whispers, past the church of San Bartolomé where he would attend Mass tomorrow morning as he did every Sunday, his presence noted, his devotion documented by the eyes that never stopped watching.

A figure stood in the shadow of the church's western wall.

Diego's feet slowed before his mind registered why. The woman wore the simple grey habit of a beata, her veil drawn forward to shadow her face. She stood motionless, hands folded at her waist, her attention fixed on something Diego could not see—or perhaps on nothing at all, the stillness of prayer or vision or some interior conversation that excluded the world entire.

He knew her. Everyone in Toledo knew Sor Catalina. The holy woman who had visions, who counseled the troubled, who spoke with bishops and beggars alike in the same measured voice. She had come to the converso quarter three months ago, taking up residence in a small house near the Plaza de Zocodover, and since then her presence had become a fixture—always watching, always available, always accompanied by whispers about those she had helped find their way back to God's grace.

Diego should have walked past. A physician had no business with a beata, no reason to draw attention to himself by acknowledging her. But his feet stopped, and he found himself standing ten paces from her shadow, close enough to see the line of her profile against the church's pale stone.

She turned her head.

The veil fell back slightly, and Diego saw her face. Dark hair drawn back severely from a widow's peak. A single thick strand had escaped and fell across her left temple, darker than the rest, catching what little light remained in the street. Her eyes were difficult to read in the dusk—one seemed lighter than the other, or perhaps it was the angle, a trick of shadow that made the left eye appear to hold some pale crescent where no crescent should exist.

She smiled. The expression did not touch her eyes.

"Physician." Her voice was soft, musical even, though something in its steadiness made Diego think of still water over deep mud. "You walk late."

"Patients do not observe the hours of prayer." The answer came automatically, the same response he had given Don Cristóbal that afternoon, the same shield of usefulness he wore against all questions.

"No." Sor Catalina's gaze did not waver. "They do not. And yet you carry your bag but visit no one. Perhaps you walk to think. Or perhaps you walk to avoid thinking."

The unease in Diego's chest sharpened into something colder. He had never spoken to this woman, never been closer to her than across a plaza or at the edge of a crowd. She should not know him well enough to read his habits, should not have noticed his movements through streets where hundreds moved daily.

"I walk for air," he said.

"Of course." She inclined her head, the gesture graceful and somehow mocking at once, as though she humored him by accepting the lie. "The air in the quarter is foul with smoke. A man needs clean breath to do his work."

Diego's hand found the strap of his medical bag. His fingers tightened against the leather, steadying himself the way his physician's hands steadied when preparing a difficult suture.

"You visited the house of Tomás de Mendoza this morning."

It was not a question. Sor Catalina spoke as though stating a fact already known, already recorded, already part of some accounting Diego could not see but whose weight he felt pressing against his ribs.

"I counsel those in distress," she continued. Her smile remained fixed, gentle, terrible in its gentleness. "Tomás suffers greatly. His son has been arrested. He fears for Rafael's soul—and for his own. The burden of sin weighs heavy on a man, physician. Confession cleanses. This is what the Holy Office teaches. This is what I help men understand."

Diego's throat had gone dry. He wanted to ask what Tomás had said, what sins he had confessed, what names he had spoken in his distress. But the questions themselves would be admissions—of shared secrets, of common guilt, of the Friday candles and Hebrew prayers that linked their households in ways the Inquisition existed to uncover.

"Tomás is a good man," Diego managed.

"All men believe themselves good." Sor Catalina took a step forward. The movement was unhurried, almost floating, as though she moved through water instead of air. "But goodness requires truth, physician. The soul cannot be clean while it harbors deception. Would you not agree? You, whose work is to heal—do you not understand that hidden infection must be drawn out before the flesh can mend?"

She stood three paces away now, close enough that Diego could see her face clearly despite the failing light. Something about her features pulled at him—not recognition, exactly, but a deeper unease, as though he had seen this face before in a dream he could not remember, as though this woman's eyes had looked at him from some other time, some other place, with the same watching stillness that made his skin draw tight across his shoulders.

"I understand that healing requires care," Diego said. His voice remained steady, though the steadiness cost him something he could not name. "And that good physicians do not cause unnecessary pain."

"How kind you are." Sor Catalina's smile widened slightly, and for a moment Diego was certain—absolutely certain—that beneath the expression lay something colder than Toledo stone, older than the church behind her, patient as a hunter watching prey circle back into range. "But perhaps some pain is necessary. Perhaps God sends suffering to test us, to burn away the dross and reveal the pure metal beneath. The Holy Office understands this. Confession is a mercy, even when it comes through fire."

She reached out as though to touch his arm, then stopped, her hand suspended between them. The gesture was casual, meaningless, but Diego's body recoiled before his mind could stop it. He stepped back, the medical bag swinging against his hip.

Sor Catalina lowered her hand. Her expression did not change, but something flickered in those strange eyes—amusement, perhaps, or satisfaction. The recognition of fear.

"Walk carefully, physician," she said. "These are uncertain times. The sick are everywhere, and not all sickness is of the body. Some infections run deeper." She drew her veil forward again, shadowing her face. "I will pray for you. And for those you love."

She turned and walked toward the darkened plaza, her grey habit blending into evening's shadows until Diego could no longer distinguish her shape from the general darkness gathering in Toledo's narrow streets.

He stood alone outside San Bartolomé, his hand still gripping his medical bag's strap, his breathing shallow and quick despite the stillness of his body. Something had just happened—some transaction, some marking, some notation made in a ledger he would never see. The Holy Office kept meticulous records. Everyone knew this. And Sor Catalina counseled those in distress, helped them confess their burdens, guided them toward the cleansing fire of truth.

Diego touched his fingers together in sequence. Index. Middle. Ring. Smallest. The physician's ritual. The steadying gesture.

His hands shook.

That night, Diego dreamed.

In the dream, he stood in his consultation room, but the light was wrong—too bright, too cold, as though the sun had moved closer to earth and burned away all shadows. A woman's face looked at him from across the table. Dark hair. Widow's peak. Eyes that watched without blinking.

He knew her. He did not know her. The certainty and impossibility existed together, two truths that should have canceled each other but instead pressed against his chest until breathing became labor.

She spoke, but he could not hear the words. Her mouth moved, shaping syllables in a language he did not understand—or perhaps in a language he had forgotten, something older than Castilian, older than Hebrew, older than any tongue still spoken in the waking world.

He wanted to run. His feet would not move.

She smiled. The same smile she had worn outside the church. Gentle and terrible, as though she pitied him for something he had not yet done but would inevitably commit.

Her hand reached across the table toward his face—

Diego woke in darkness, his heart hammering against his ribs. Beside him, Inés slept undisturbed, her breathing steady and slow. Through the window, the stars were visible—countless and cold, the same stars that had looked down on his grandfather's grandfather, on generations of men who had hidden their prayers and performed their faith and hoped that usefulness would prove armor enough against the world's suspicion.

He touched his fingers together in sequence. Index. Middle. Ring. Smallest.

The hands were steady now. They were always steady, in the end.

But beneath the steadiness, beneath the performance, beneath the physician's careful calm, something had shifted. Some knowledge he could not name, some recognition his body held that his mind refused.

The woman in grey watched him. She had always been watching. And somewhere in the spaces between waking and dreaming, in the gaps where memory could not quite reach, Diego knew—with the terrible certainty of things felt rather than understood—that she would not stop.
