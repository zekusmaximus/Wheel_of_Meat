Time lost meaning in the cell. Meals arrived through the grate's slot—bread hard enough to crack teeth, water that tasted of iron and something organic Diego's mind refused to examine. Twice a day, he thought, though the thin grey light from the high window never changed enough to mark dawn from dusk with certainty. He counted meals instead. Seven. Or eight. Perhaps nine. The numbers slipped away from him like water through fingers, leaving only the thickness of isolation, the weight of silence broken only by distant sounds—footsteps in corridors, voices too muffled to parse into words, occasionally screaming that cut off abruptly in ways Diego's physician's mind understood but refused to fully acknowledge.

He had not been interrogated. No inquisitor had come. No questions asked. The waiting was its own persuasion, he understood—the slow erosion of certainty, the grinding pressure of solitude designed to make any human contact, even interrogation, seem preferable to continued isolation.

On the tenth meal—or perhaps the twelfth—the cell gate opened.

A guard stood in the corridor, his face as expressionless as the scribe's had been. "You have a visitor. Come."

Diego's body moved before his mind could process the words. He rose from the pallet where he had been lying—conserving warmth, conserving strength, the physician's practical knowledge applied to his own deterioration—and followed the guard down the corridor he had walked days ago, though now every step required conscious effort. His legs trembled. His bare feet registered the stone's cold with a sharpness that suggested fever, though whether from illness or simply from his body's slow surrender to this place, he could not determine.

They did not go to the interrogation chambers. The guard led him instead to a small room Diego had not seen before—barely larger than his cell, but furnished with a table and two stools and lit by a single candle whose flame seemed bright as noon sun after days of grey twilight.

"Sit," the guard said. "Do not speak until the visitor arrives. Do not touch. Do not approach closer than the table's width."

Diego sat. The stool was wood, worn smooth by countless bodies, and the simple act of sitting on something other than rotting straw felt almost luxurious. His hands found the table's edge and gripped it, needing the solidity, the confirmation that he still possessed a body capable of sensation beyond cold and hunger and the peculiar numbness that came from days without human voice or human touch.

The door opened.

Tomás de Mendoza stood in the threshold.

He had aged. That was Diego's first thought—irrational, impossible, it had been less than two weeks since the arrest. But Tomás's face had hollowed, his eyes sunk deep in sockets ringed with darkness, his hair gone grey at the temples in a way Diego's physician's training said was not possible over mere days but which his eyes insisted had occurred anyway. Grief did this sometimes. Or guilt.

Or both.

Tomás sat on the opposite stool. His hands shook as he placed them on the table, palm-down, fingers splayed as though trying to hold something in place that kept threatening to slip away. He did not meet Diego's eyes.

The guard stepped back but remained in the doorway, present and watching, ensuring no contraband passed between prisoner and visitor, no forbidden communication occurred beyond whatever script the Holy Office permitted or required.

"Diego." Tomás's voice cracked. "I—"

"Why are you here?" Diego's own voice emerged hoarse from disuse, rough as gravel, but steadier than he expected. The physician's calm asserting itself even now, even here, the performance continuing because performance was all he had left.

"I had to see you. I had to—" Tomás's breath hitched. His hands pressed harder against the table, knuckles whitening. "They have Rafael. They offered me... I couldn't let them... You understand, don't you?"

Understanding arrived with the force of physical blow. Diego felt it strike his chest, drive the air from his lungs, leave him gasping against a pain that had no wound to mark it. Not surprise—he had known, had suspected from the moment of arrest—but confirmation. The difference between suspecting betrayal and hearing it confessed.

"You testified," Diego said. Not a question.

"They had Rafael." Tomás's voice rose, defensive and pleading at once. "They said he would burn unless I gave them truth. They said families who protect each other through confession find mercy. They said—"

"What did you tell them?"

Tomás flinched. His eyes finally rose to meet Diego's, and in them Diego saw the full weight of what had been done. "The Friday candles. The fasting on certain days. The prayers your father taught us both in Hebrew. The..."

He continued, but Diego stopped hearing individual words. The list became a blur of specifics—intimate details, witnessed moments, shared secrets accumulated across twenty years of friendship and trust. Every Sabbath observed in whispered secret. Every holiday marked in the old way. Every prayer spoken in the language their grandparents had been forbidden to teach their children but had taught anyway, passing down memory like contraband, like inheritance, like the poison that would eventually kill them all.

Tomás knew everything. And Tomás had spoken everything. To inquisitors who wrote it all down with the same methodical care the scribe had employed recording Diego's genealogy, building the case that would justify whatever needed justifying—torture or death or the particular mercy of strangulation before burning granted to those who confessed fully and repented truly.

"—not supposed to arrest you," Tomás was saying. His words penetrated Diego's awareness in fragments. "They said if I testified, they would question you, give you chance to confess. Reconciliation, not—" His voice broke. "You understand, Diego. What would you have done? What choice did they give me?"

Diego's hands had begun to shake. He felt the tremor start in his fingers and spread up his arms, into his shoulders, into his chest where something hot and jagged was pushing upward toward his throat. Not quite hatred yet. Not quite. But close. So close.

"Rafael is your son," Diego said quietly. The words came from somewhere very far away, somewhere cold and clear and empty of everything except observation. "You chose your son."

"Yes." Tomás seized on this as though it were absolution. "Yes. What father wouldn't? What man could watch his child burn and not—"

"I taught Rafael to read." Diego's voice remained quiet, clinical, the physician noting symptoms without judgment. "When he was seven and the fever made him delirious, I sat by his bed for three nights. When Maria was born early and the midwife said she would not live, I kept her breathing until her lungs strengthened. Your children. Your family. Twenty years of Friday evenings at your table. Your father taught me the prayers you gave to the Inquisition. He held my father while my father died."

Each sentence fell between them like stones into still water, and Diego watched the ripples spread across Tomás's face—recognition, shame, the desperate need for Diego to say what Tomás needed to hear: *I understand. I forgive. You had no choice. I would have done the same.*

Diego said nothing.

"What would you have done?" Tomás's voice cracked completely now, dissolving into something raw and pleading. "Tell me, Diego. Your child or your friend? Which would you choose?"

The answer should have been obvious. The answer was obvious. Children came first. Blood came first. The choice was impossible and inevitable and human and understandable.

And Diego hated him anyway.

The hatred arrived fully formed, born complete like something that had been gestating in darkness and now emerged into light—not abstract principle or philosophical opposition but specific, visceral loathing for the man across the table. For Tomás's hollow face and shaking hands. For the justification Diego could see forming behind his eyes, the narrative taking shape: *I saved my son. Any man would have done the same. Diego will understand. Diego must understand.*

But understanding and forgiveness were not the same thing. And Diego, sitting in a cell he would likely die in, his body marked for breaking and his name already written in the ledgers of the condemned, understood perfectly and forgave nothing.

"You should not have come," Diego said.

"I needed you to know I didn't—I never meant—"

"You came for yourself." The observation emerged without heat, without emphasis, a diagnosis delivered to a patient who would not survive regardless of treatment. "You needed absolution. You needed me to tell you that you did the right thing. That the choice was impossible. That I do not hate you."

Tomás's face crumpled. "Do you? Hate me?"

Diego looked at his old friend—at the man who had taught him Hebrew prayers, who had sat shiva with his family, who had shared bread and salt and the secret observances that marked them as family in ways blood could not match. And he felt the hatred burning in his chest like live coal, hot and bright and almost comforting in its clarity.

"Yes," he said quietly. "I do."

Tomás made a sound—not quite a sob, not quite a gasp, something between grief and relief. As though Diego's honesty, brutal as it was, provided something closer to absolution than forgiveness could have offered. As though being hated cleanly was preferable to being forgiven falsely.

"I'm sorry," Tomás whispered.

"I know."

The guard stepped forward. "Time is finished."

Tomás rose on shaking legs. He looked at Diego as though wanting to say more, to offer something beyond apology, but the words did not come or could not come or had been exhausted along with everything else. He turned toward the door.

"Tomás."

He stopped.

"Rafael," Diego said. "Is he safe?"

Tomás's shoulders shook. He did not turn around. "Yes. They released him. He is home."

"Good."

The door closed. Tomás's footsteps faded down the corridor.

Diego sat alone in the small room with its single candle throwing shadows against stone walls. His hands rested on the table where Tomás's hands had rested moments before—palms down, fingers splayed, holding nothing. The trembling had stopped. The hatred remained, solid and heavy in his chest, a weight he could carry or set down but which existed now as simple fact rather than potential.

The guard returned to lead him back to his cell. Diego followed without resistance, his body moving through the familiar corridors while his mind circled the hatred the way a tongue circles a broken tooth—testing its edges, measuring its depth, confirming its presence.

Tomás had betrayed him. The betrayal was understandable. The betrayal was unforgivable. Both truths existed together, contradiction and paradox, and Diego—physician, healer, man who had spent his life trying to mend what was broken—could not reconcile them, could only acknowledge that hatred had taken root in soil prepared by forty-three years of suppressed rage and exhausted performance, and now grew with the vigor of something that had finally found proper conditions for its flourishing.

The cell gate closed behind him. The lock turned.

Diego lay on the straw pallet in grey light and felt the hatred pulse in his chest with each heartbeat—steady, persistent, alive in ways the rest of him had begun to feel hollow. The physician who had examined symptoms in others now examined this new symptom in himself, cataloguing its presence with clinical precision even as some other part of him—some part that remembered who he had been before the knock, before the arrest, before the world inverted—whispered that the hatred would poison him more surely than any torture the Inquisition could devise.

But poison or not, it was his. The only thing in this place that belonged to him alone, that the Holy Office could not take, could not record, could not reduce to entries in a ledger.

His hatred. Specific and personal and burning bright enough to warm him in the cold cell's darkness.

He closed his eyes and let it burn.
