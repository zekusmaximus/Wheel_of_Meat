The guard came three days after the interrogation—or what Diego believed was three days, time having dissolved into cycles of meals and darkness and waiting for pain that had not yet come but whose promise hung over every waking moment like storm clouds that refused to break.

"Physician." The guard's voice carried neither sympathy nor cruelty, only the flat utility of someone delivering information. "Your services are required."

Diego rose from the pallet where he had been lying in half-sleep, the state between waking and dreaming that had become his default condition. His legs trembled as weight settled onto them—not from torture, which had not yet been applied, but from disuse and the slow starvation of prison rations. His hands found the cell's wall for balance, stone cold and damp beneath his palms.

"Required where?" His voice emerged hoarse.

"You will see."

They led him through corridors grown familiar in their wrongness, past cells where other prisoners lay or sat or stood pressed against grates watching his passage with eyes that held every stage of suffering—fresh terror, grinding endurance, empty surrender. The prison was a catalog of dissolution, bodies at various points along the path from person to confession to whatever lay beyond confession when the Holy Office had extracted everything extract-able and the remnant was released to secular authorities for final disposition.

The guard stopped before a cell three corridors from Diego's own. Through the grate, Diego could see a shape on the floor—a man, though gender was nearly indeterminate beneath the filth and damage. The shape moved shallowly, breath coming in hitches that Diego's physician's ear recognized immediately: broken ribs, possibly punctured lung, airway partially obstructed.

"This one was examined yesterday," the guard said. The euphemism was unnecessary—examined meant tortured, everyone understood this, the language of bureaucracy performing its sanitizing function. "He requires attention before further questioning can proceed. You will provide such attention."

The cell gate opened. The guard gestured Diego inside.

The man on the floor could not have been more than thirty, though suffering had aged him past easy estimation. His shoulders sat at wrong angles—both dislocated, Diego diagnosed instantly, the strappado's signature damage. His wrists bore the deep purple-black of rope burns where he had hung from his own weight. Blood crusted his nose and mouth, suggesting either impact trauma or the beginning stages of drowning from the toca before they had pulled him back from the edge.

Diego knelt beside him. The physician's instinct took over despite everything—despite being a prisoner himself, despite knowing what he was being asked to do, despite the bitter irony of healing a man so the Holy Office could hurt him again. His hands moved over the broken body with practiced care, assessing damage with the same methodical precision he had brought to every patient in his consultation room.

"Water," Diego said without looking at the guard. "Clean cloth if you have it. Salve for the burns."

The guard left. Returned minutes later with a bucket of water that smelled only slightly foul and a rag that might once have been white. No salve. Diego had not truly expected any.

He wet the cloth and began cleaning the man's face, working around swelling and contusions to clear crusted blood from nose and mouth. The man's breathing eased slightly—a small improvement, but improvement nonetheless. Airway clearing. Basic care. The foundation upon which all healing built.

"Thank you," the man whispered. His voice was barely audible, each word clearly painful, but carried genuine gratitude that struck Diego's chest like a blow.

Thank you. For this. For cleaning his face while his shoulders hung dislocated and his ribs ground against punctured lung tissue and his wrists wept clear fluid that suggested infection brewing beneath the burns.

Diego's hands paused. He stared at the cloth in his grip—bloodstained now, filthy with the evidence of the Holy Office's patient work. What was he doing? What was he providing here except the means for this suffering to continue? If he left the shoulders dislocated, if he allowed infection to spread, if he did nothing at all, this man would die. Not peacefully—infection deaths were ugly, painful, prolonged—but die nonetheless, and dying would end his suffering where healing would only extend it.

"The shoulders," the man whispered. "Please. I cannot... the pain..."

He could refuse. Diego realized this with sudden clarity. Could tell the guard he lacked materials, lacked knowledge, lacked whatever excuse seemed plausible. The Holy Office might torture him for refusing—but they would torture him anyway, eventually. Interrogations did not end with a single session. The machinery had its own momentum, its own requirements. His cooperation or resistance in this moment would change nothing except whether this one man's shoulders remained dislocated or not.

Except. Except the man was asking. Thanking him. Looking at Diego's hands as though they represented mercy in a place where mercy had been systematically excised from all interactions.

Diego's hands moved before his mind finished deliberating. Training deeper than thought. The physician's reflex older than this prison, older than the Inquisition, older than every rational reason to let broken things stay broken.

He positioned himself at the man's side. "This will hurt," he said quietly. "I am sorry."

The man nodded understanding.

Diego gripped the man's right arm, found the proper angle, and pulled while rotating in the motion he had performed hundreds of times for dislocated joints. The shoulder resisted—swelling made the manipulation harder, muscles had contracted around the injury—but Diego applied steady pressure until the humeral head found its socket with a sound like wet wood cracking.

The man screamed. Brief and sharp, cut off by breath-hitching pain, then subsiding into panting silence.

One shoulder. Diego repeated the procedure on the left. Another scream. Another moment of agony Diego had chosen to inflict in service of healing that was not healing at all but merely making this body functional enough to survive more breaking.

"Thank you," the man gasped when he could speak again. "God bless you. Thank you."

The gratitude was real. The blessing sincere. The man's pain had lessened—shoulders in proper alignment hurt less than shoulders wrenched from sockets, this was simple anatomical fact. Diego had helped. Had healed. Had done his physician's duty.

And had thereby ensured that tomorrow, or the next day, or whenever the inquisitors decided further questioning was necessary, this man would be strong enough to endure more examination. More persuasion. More machinery applied to flesh until confession came or death intervened.

The guard appeared at the cell gate. "Finished?"

Diego looked down at the man on the floor. Color had returned slightly to his face. Breathing came easier. The shoulders sat in proper alignment, and though the damage would take weeks to heal fully, immediate crisis had been averted.

Crisis. The word was obscene. As though avoiding death in a cell where death would come regardless constituted meaningful improvement.

"Yes," Diego said.

They returned him to his own cell. The gate closed. The lock turned.

Diego stood in grey light, his hands hanging at his sides, and saw them as though for the first time—these hands that had spent forty-three years learning to mend what was broken, to heal what was wounded, to preserve life against suffering and death. Useful hands. Skilled hands. The physician's instruments.

Now instruments of the Holy Office's patience. Tools that extended suffering by preventing early death. The means by which examination could continue, persuasion could deepen, the machinery could grind forward without the inefficiency of prisoners dying before confession was complete.

He had believed usefulness would protect him. Had spent his life cultivating skill because skill meant value, and value meant survival. But usefulness had no loyalty. His healing served whatever master required it—the merchant with gout, the priest's sister with inflammation, or the inquisitors who needed prisoners functional enough to break properly.

The gratitude haunted him more than the breaking. The man had thanked him. Had blessed him. Had looked at Diego's work as though it were kindness rather than complicity, as though resetting dislocated shoulders in a torture chamber were medicine rather than collaboration with the machinery designed to extract confession through the systematic application of pain.

Diego sat on his pallet. The straw crunched beneath his weight, releasing smells he had stopped noticing through constant exposure. His hands rested in his lap—steady now, competent, the physician's hands that knew their work and did it well regardless of context.

He hated them. Hated the training that made them move before thought could intervene. Hated the skill that made them useful to those who would use them. Hated the bargain he had made—unknowing, unspoken, but binding nonetheless—that his value to the world depended on his willingness to heal without regard to what that healing enabled.

The hatred that had burned for Tomás, that had extended to the inquisitors and the woman in grey who watched with eyes too knowing for comfort, now turned inward. Self-hatred joined the other hatreds, took root in soil prepared by every patient he had treated believing that service would purchase safety, that usefulness would armor him against a world that wanted his blood regardless of his skill.

He had been wrong. About everything. About the bargain's terms. About safety's price. About whether healing was virtue or simply another form of violence wearing mercy's mask.

His hands touched together in sequence—index, middle, ring, smallest. The gesture that steadied. The physician's ritual.

They did not steady. They shook with exhaustion and hatred and the recognition that he could not refuse to heal anymore than he could refuse to breathe, that the compulsion was woven too deep to extract without destroying whatever remained of who he had been before the knock, before the arrest, before the world inverted and revealed the truth beneath every careful performance: he was meat, and his meat's particular skills were useful, and usefulness was obligation rather than protection.

Somewhere in the prison's depths, the man with reset shoulders breathed easier and waited for tomorrow's examination. Grateful. Blessed. Alive because Diego's hands had moved and done what they were trained to do.

Diego closed his eyes and felt the hatred pulse beneath his breastbone—for Tomás who had betrayed, for inquisitors who questioned, for the woman who watched, for the Holy Office that consumed, and now for himself. For his own hands. For the healer who could not help but heal even when healing was the cruelest thing he could have done.

The only honest response to this place was hatred. The only recognition of what was being done to him, and what he was being made to do, was rage at all of it—the machinery and those who ran it and those who fed it and himself for being made instrument rather than person, tool rather than human, useful rather than free.

The hatred kept him warm. The only warmth in the cold cell.

He held it close and waited for the next summons, the next broken body, the next opportunity to provide the Holy Office with exactly what they needed from the physician whose skill had never protected him but would, before this ended, be used to protect the Inquisition's investment in prisoners whose confessions had not yet been extracted and whose bodies required maintenance before they could be properly broken toward truth.
