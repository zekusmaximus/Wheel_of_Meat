They came for him after the evening meal—or what Diego had learned to recognize as evening by the pattern of sounds beyond his cell, the shift in the thin light, the rhythm of the prison settling into night's particular silence. Two guards, neither speaking, leading him through corridors he had not seen before, deeper into the prison's heart where the air grew thicker and the walls wept moisture that caught torchlight and gleamed like something organic.

The interrogation chamber was larger than Diego expected and smaller than his dread had imagined. A table stood at the room's center, lit by candles arranged in a careful circle—too many candles, their combined light bright and shadowless and somehow more terrible than darkness would have been. Behind the table sat three men in the black robes of the Holy Office, their faces half-hidden by hoods drawn forward, their hands folded with the stillness of those accustomed to waiting.

A small desk stood to one side, and at it sat a scribe—perhaps the same scribe who had processed Diego's arrival, though the distance and candlelight made certainty impossible. His quill was already poised, ready to record whatever emerged from the questions that would follow.

And in the corner, almost invisible in the shadows the candles could not quite banish, stood a figure in grey.

Diego's breath caught. His body recognized her before his mind could process why—some animal awareness deeper than thought, older than reason, the instinct that made prey freeze when predators drew near.

Sor Catalina.

She stood motionless, her hands folded at her waist, her veil drawn forward to shadow her face. But Diego could see her eyes—watchful, patient, fixed on him with the same intensity he had felt outside San Bartolomé, the same weight of attention that had followed him through dreams and waking both.

"Diego de Lucena." The central inquisitor's voice was gentle, almost kind, the tone a physician might use with a frightened child. "Please. Sit."

A stool had been placed before the table. Diego's legs carried him forward, his body performing obedience while his mind catalogued details with the physician's trained observation: the inquisitors' careful positioning, the scribe's ready quill, the woman in the corner whose presence made his skin prickle with cold that had nothing to do with the chamber's temperature.

He sat.

"We know everything, Diego." The inquisitor leaned forward slightly, candlelight catching the deep lines around his mouth. "The witnesses have spoken. Their testimony has been examined and verified. What remains is your confession—not to inform us of your sins, which are already known, but to cleanse your soul through acknowledgment. Do you understand?"

The trap was perfect. Confession meant admitting guilt. Denial meant disputing testimony already deemed credible. Silence meant obstinacy that would require stronger persuasion. Every path led to the same destination—only the route varied, and the suffering along the way.

"I understand," Diego said.

"Good." The inquisitor nodded, satisfied. "Then let us begin. Did you light candles on Friday evenings?"

Diego's hands found each other in his lap, fingers touching in sequence—index, middle, ring, smallest. The gesture was automatic, seeking steadiness that would not come, control that had already been stripped away along with everything else.

"I lit candles," he said carefully. "For light. As any household—"

"Two candles. Lit as the sun set. Placed in the window according to the old rite." The inquisitor's voice remained gentle, but something beneath the gentleness had gone hard. "Do not insult God's servants with evasion, Diego. We seek truth, not wordplay."

How did they know? The question rose and died unspoken. Tomás knew. Tomás had testified. The two candles in the window, the prayers spoken in whisper, the Friday meal that marked time according to a calendar the Holy Office had declared heretical—all of it documented now, recorded, transformed into evidence that could not be disputed because disputing it meant calling the witnesses liars, and the witnesses had already been deemed reliable.

"I lit candles on Friday," Diego admitted.

The scribe's quill scratched. Recording. Preserving. Creating the permanent account that would justify whatever came next.

"And did you abstain from pork?"

"Sometimes. For... medical reasons. The meat was often spoiled in summer—"

"Did you fast on certain days? Days that happened to coincide with Jewish holy days despite your professed Christian faith?"

Diego's throat had gone dry. The questions came faster now, each one building on the last, constructing a framework of guilt that grew more solid with every answer. Yes, he had fasted. Yes, on days that might have been Yom Kippur if anyone were observing such things, which he was not, which his family was not, except that they were and everyone knew it and the pretense had been exactly that—pretense, performance, the lie he had lived so long he had almost convinced himself it was truth.

"Did you speak Hebrew prayers at your father's deathbed?"

Something in Diego broke. Not his composure—that remained intact, the physician's calm still functioning despite everything. What broke was deeper, harder to name. The last hope that this was mistake, misunderstanding, something that could be corrected through proper explanation.

They knew everything. Every private moment. Every secret observance. Every prayer spoken in darkness when the world should not have been watching. But the world was always watching, and Tomás had watched alongside him, had spoken the same prayers, had performed the same rites, and then had carried every detail to the Holy Office like tribute, like payment, like the price of his son's freedom purchased with his friend's blood.

"Yes," Diego whispered.

The quill scratched. The candles burned without flickering, their light steady and pitiless.

The inquisitor sat back, his expression unreadable behind the hood's shadow. "You see how easy truth is? How simple confession becomes when we stop clinging to deception?" He folded his hands on the table, a gesture that might have been prayer or satisfaction. "But we are not finished, Diego. Confession must be complete. Partial truth is no truth at all. Tell us—who shared these practices with you? What other families observed the old rites? Who else must be brought to understanding so their souls might be saved?"

And there it was. The true purpose beneath the questioning. Diego was not the goal—he was the means. The Holy Office wanted names. Wanted the network mapped, the connections documented, the whole community of secret observers exposed so the purification could be thorough, complete, absolute.

"I observed alone," Diego said.

The inquisitor's expression did not change, but something in his stillness sharpened. "Alone? A man does not learn Hebrew prayers alone. A man does not maintain Jewish holy days alone. Someone taught you. Someone shared these practices. Give us their names, Diego. Confession cleanses—but only complete confession. Protecting heretics damns your soul as surely as heresy itself."

Diego's gaze drifted past the inquisitors to the corner where Sor Catalina stood. She had not moved. Had not spoken. But her eyes—those strange eyes with their pale crescent that caught candlelight and seemed to glow with illumination that came from within rather than without—remained fixed on him with an intensity that made breathing difficult.

Why was she here? The question circled his mind like a bird seeking purchase. Beatas did not attend interrogations. Holy women counseled the distressed, prayed for the condemned, offered spiritual comfort—but they did not stand in corners watching men be broken question by question toward confession.

Unless. Unless she was not here for him. Unless she was here to learn. To witness. To carry back to others in the converso community the lesson of what happened to those who resisted, who protected their fellows, who chose solidarity over survival.

Or unless—and this thought arrived with a cold that spread through Diego's chest like winter—she was here because she had helped arrange this. Had counseled Tomás toward testimony. Had guided the Holy Office toward questions that would trap. Had stood in this corner before, watching other men crumble, and would stand here again when Diego's turn was done.

"I will ask again." The inquisitor's voice lost its gentleness. "Who shared these practices? Your wife? Your neighbors? The merchant Tomás de Mendoza, who has already confessed his own sins and seeks now to aid others toward truth?"

Tomás had given them Diego. But not, apparently, others. Or perhaps he had given partial names, partial testimony, and the Holy Office wanted confirmation, wanted the network fully mapped before moving against it.

"My wife observed Christian practices," Diego said. Each word emerged slow, careful, the physician treating speech as delicate work requiring precision. "She attended Mass. She kept the feasts. She is innocent of any—"

"That is not what we asked." The inquisitor stood. The movement was sudden enough to make Diego flinch, his body betraying the fear his voice still managed to control. "We asked who else maintained the Jewish rites. Who else must be brought to confession. Answer truthfully, Diego, or we will be forced to employ methods more rigorous than gentle questioning."

There it was. The threat made explicit. Torture. The strappado that would dislocate his shoulders. The toca that would fill his lungs with water until drowning seemed imminent and preferable to continuation. The potro that would stretch his joints until cartilage tore and bones separated and his healer's hands—the hands that had set fractures and sutured wounds—would be rendered useless, broken, transformed into evidence of the Holy Office's patient dedication to extracting truth regardless of cost.

Diego's hands found each other, fingers pressing together in sequence. The ritual that steadied. The gesture that controlled. Index, middle, ring, smallest. Again. Again.

In the corner, Sor Catalina watched. Her expression remained neutral, pious, as though she observed a religious rite rather than a man being dismantled question by question toward breaking. But something in her eyes—some quality Diego could not name but felt like pressure against his chest—suggested satisfaction. Or anticipation.

"I do not know others who practiced," Diego said quietly. "I maintained the rites my father taught me. What others did in their own houses, I cannot speak to."

It was the truth. A careful truth, shaped and limited, but truth nonetheless. He suspected many families in the Quarter maintained secret observances. Everyone suspected. But suspicion was not knowledge, and knowledge was what the Holy Office demanded.

The inquisitor studied him in silence. The candles burned. The scribe's quill remained poised but did not move—nothing to record without confession.

"You are protecting them," the inquisitor said finally. "You choose to protect heretics over your own soul's salvation." He gestured to the guards waiting by the door. "Perhaps deeper reflection will clarify your memory. We will speak again, Diego de Lucena. When you are ready to embrace truth completely."

The guards moved forward. The interview was over—for now. Diego rose on shaking legs, his body exhausted by the effort of maintaining control through questioning that had felt like surgery performed without knife or blood but cutting nonetheless.

As the guards led him toward the door, he passed close to Sor Catalina's corner. Close enough to see her face clearly beneath the veil's shadow. Close enough to meet her eyes directly.

She smiled.

It was the same smile she had worn outside San Bartolomé—gentle, terrible, empty of everything except a knowing that transcended the interrogation chamber, transcended this moment, transcended everything Diego understood about the world and his place in it. As though she could see futures he could not imagine, as though his suffering were already written and she merely watched it unfold according to plan.

Diego wanted to speak. Wanted to ask why. Wanted to demand what right she had to stand in corners watching men be broken for sins they had committed only in the privacy of their own hearts and homes.

But the guards were pulling him forward, and speech was forbidden, and she was already turning away—dissolving back into shadow as though she had never been solid, as though her presence were vision or dream or something that existed in the spaces between real and imagined.

The door closed behind him. The corridor's cold wrapped around him like familiar darkness.

They did not return him to his cell. Instead they led him down stairs that descended into depths where even the torches seemed reluctant to burn, where the air grew thick with the smell of old blood and sweat and fear so concentrated it had seeped into the stones themselves.

The guards stopped before a door reinforced with iron straps.

"Tomorrow," one of them said—the first words either had spoken. "Tomorrow you will have opportunity to remember what you claimed to have forgotten. The Holy Office is patient. But patience has limits."

They opened the door onto darkness deeper than his cell had ever known, onto silence broken only by distant sounds Diego's physician's training allowed him to recognize and his humanity begged him to deny.

He stepped inside. The door closed. The darkness became absolute.

Diego stood in perfect black, his hands finding each other by touch alone, fingers pressing together in sequence—index, middle, ring, smallest—while somewhere above him Sor Catalina walked Toledo's streets and smiled at those who sought her counsel, and tomorrow the questioning would resume and continue and deepen until confession came or death provided mercy the Holy Office would not grant while his body still held secrets they believed could be extracted.

His hands would not steady.

In the darkness, hatred pulsed beneath his breastbone—for the inquisitors who believed their cruelty holy, for the system that consumed the innocent, for Tomás who had spoken every secret, and for the woman in grey whose eyes watched with an attention that exceeded human interest and approached something older, colder, patient as stone waiting for weather to wear it down to nothing.

The hatred kept him warm in the absolute dark. The only thing in this place that belonged to him alone.

He held it close and waited for tomorrow's suffering to begin.
