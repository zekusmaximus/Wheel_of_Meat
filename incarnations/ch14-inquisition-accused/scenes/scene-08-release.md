# Scene 8: The Release

---

Night came, though in the cell night and day were distinguished only by subtle shifts in the grey light that seeped through the high window—darker grey, lighter grey, the prison's own twilight that never truly lifted or settled but simply existed as permanent condition. Diego lay on the straw pallet, his body too exhausted to sleep, his mind too active to rest. The hatred pulsed beneath his breastbone with each heartbeat—steady, persistent, almost comforting in its constancy.

He examined it the way he would examine a wound. What was it made of? Where had it taken root? The physician's diagnostic approach applied to the condition of his own interior state, as though cataloging symptoms might reveal treatment or at least understanding.

Tomás's face appeared first. The hollow eyes. The shaking hands. The desperate need for absolution Diego had refused to give. The hatred for Tomás was specific, personal—rage at a man who had chosen his son over his friend, who had carried twenty years of shared secrets to the Holy Office like tithe, who watched from his window while Diego walked to imprisonment bought with testimony that could not be retracted or forgiven.

But the hatred did not stop with Tomás.

The inquisitors with their gentle voices and patient questions. The scribe whose quill transformed lives into evidence. The guards who performed their duty with mechanical precision. The woman in grey who watched from corners with eyes that seemed to see past the surface of things to some truth Diego could not name but felt like weight pressing against his chest. The Holy Office entire—the machinery that consumed the innocent and guilty alike, that made no distinction between devotion and performance because performance was always suspect and devotion could never be proven.

And himself. The physician who could not stop healing. The useful man who had believed usefulness would protect him. The performer who had lived forty-three years in careful safety purchased with constant vigilance, only to discover that vigilance purchased nothing and safety was illusion and the bargain had never existed except in his own desperate need to believe competence might armor flesh against the world's cruelty.

The hatred encompassed all of it. Burned bright and hot in his chest, warming the cold cell, giving him something to hold when everything else had been stripped away. His only possession. His only certainty in a place where certainty dissolved under questioning and truth became whatever the inquisitors needed it to be.

He could carry this hatred to his death. The thought arrived clearly, without particular emotion. He could hold it close, nurse it, let it burn in his chest until the fire consumed him literally and the hatred became one with the flames. The inquisitors would burn his body, but they could not burn the rage he carried—that would remain his, inviolate, the one thing they could not extract through questioning or persuasion or machinery designed to make flesh confess what mind refused.

Except. Except.

The hatred burned, yes. Warmed him, yes. But what did it illuminate?

Diego's physician's mind turned the question over with the same care he had used examining the hatred's roots. What did this rage show him? What did it reveal?

Tomás had betrayed him. This was fact. But Tomás had also been given an impossible choice—his son's life purchased with his friend's freedom. What father would choose differently? What man could watch his child burn and not pay whatever price was demanded? The choice was understandable. Human. The kind of terrible calculus the Holy Office specialized in creating—moral dilemmas with no clean answers, situations where any choice carried guilt.

Understanding did not make it forgivable. Diego tested this recognition, probed it for weakness. No. He understood Tomás's choice completely and forgave nothing. But understanding and forgiveness were not the same thing, and hatred and understanding could exist together without canceling each other.

The inquisitors. They believed their work holy. Genuinely believed it—Diego had seen the conviction in their questions, the certainty that extracting confession served God's purpose and saved souls even when it destroyed bodies. They were not demons. They were men who had been given authority and convinced that authority served righteousness, who never questioned whether their certainty might be mistaken because questioning would undermine the foundation upon which the entire machinery rested.

Hating them was easy. Understanding them was harder. But understanding them—seeing how ordinary men became instruments of systematic cruelty through conviction they were serving good—did not require forgiving them. Did not require releasing the rage their questions provoked.

Unless.

The thought arrived quietly, almost hesitantly, like a patient presenting symptoms they were not certain merited the physician's attention.

Unless the hatred hurt Diego more than it hurt those he hated.

He sat up on the pallet, the movement sudden enough to make his head swim. The cell spun briefly before settling into familiar stone walls and grey light and the bucket whose smell he had stopped noticing through constant exposure.

Tomás would live with what he had done. Would wake every morning to Diego's face in memory. Would carry the weight of betrayal for whatever years the Holy Office granted him before finding some other reason to consume him. Diego's hatred added nothing to that burden. Changed nothing. Tomás's guilt was his own, and whether Diego hated him or not made no difference to the calculus of his suffering.

The inquisitors would continue their work. Would question and examine and extract confessions from other prisoners with the same patient dedication they brought to Diego's case. His hatred of them changed nothing. They would not know he hated them. Would not care if they did. The machinery ground forward independent of its subjects' feelings toward it.

And himself. The self-hatred for hands that healed when healing served evil, for skills that made him useful, for the bargain he had never made but had spent his life believing in—that hatred poisoned nothing except himself. Made no one else suffer. Changed no external circumstance.

The hatred existed only in his own chest. Burned only in his own interior country. Hurt only him.

This recognition settled in Diego's mind with the clarity of diagnosis after long examination. The hatred was real. The reasons for it valid. But carrying it forward accomplished nothing except ensuring that the Holy Office's work continued inside him after his body burned, that Tomás's betrayal kept betraying him through his own refusal to set down what Tomás had handed him, that he remained prisoner to rage even if—when—they released his body to secular authorities for final disposition.

He could choose to carry it. Or he could choose to set it down.

Not forgiveness. The distinction mattered. Forgiveness implied reconciliation, implied making right what had been done wrong, implied some restoration of relationship or trust. Diego could not forgive Tomás. Could not forgive the inquisitors. Could not forgive the Holy Office or the woman in grey or any of it.

But he could release them. Could open the fist clenched around the burning coal of hatred and let it fall. Not because they deserved release. Not because the wrongs they had done were acceptable or understandable or anything except what they were—cruelty, betrayal, systematic destruction of human beings in service of ideology that claimed righteousness.

But because carrying the coal burned only his own hand. And burning accomplished nothing except ensuring his suffering continued independent of theirs, that he remained bound to them through hatred long after death severed all other connections.

Diego touched his fingers together in sequence. Index. Middle. Ring. Smallest. The physician's ritual. The gesture that steadied.

His hands trembled, but less than before.

The hatred remained. He could feel it in his chest—solid, hot, real as any wound he had ever treated. But he was no longer identical with it. Some space had opened between the Diego who felt rage and the Diego who observed the rage, between the emotion and the one experiencing the emotion.

He could let it go.

Not all at once. Not completely. Hatred accumulated over forty-three years of suppression and performance and exhausted vigilance could not be released in a single moment of recognition. But the fist could begin to open. The grip could loosen. The coal could be acknowledged as burning without being held.

Tomás had chosen his son. The choice was understandable and unforgivable both. Diego released him to live with it.

The inquisitors believed their cruelty holy. The belief was genuine and monstrous both. Diego released them to their certainty.

The Holy Office ground forward, consuming the innocent. The machinery existed independent of Diego's rage toward it. He released it to continue without his hatred fueling its fires from within his own chest.

And himself. The physician who healed because he was physician, whose skill was deeper than choice, whose usefulness had never protected him but was, nevertheless, what he was. He released the hatred of his own hands. They were simply hands. They had done what they were trained to do. The evil was in the use others made of them, not in the hands themselves.

The woman in grey. Her watching eyes. Her presence in corners. The wrongness he felt when she was near. Something about her remained unresolved—some recognition his body held that his mind could not grasp. But hating her accomplished nothing. He released her to whatever purpose brought her to interrogation chambers and Toledo streets. She was not his burden to carry.

Something loosened in Diego's chest. Not the hatred disappearing—it remained, would likely always remain, the scar tissue of these weeks that no healing could fully mend. But it was no longer him. He had stepped back from it. Become the one who observed the hatred rather than the one consumed by it.

The coal fell from his hand. He watched it fall. Felt the burning ease.

Outside the cell, the prison continued its machinery. Prisoners suffered. Inquisitors questioned. Scribes recorded. The Holy Office pursued its holy work of purification through destruction, and Diego's release of hatred changed none of it.

But it changed him.

He lay back on the pallet, his body settling into straw that crunched and released familiar smells. His hands rested at his sides—steady now, or steady enough. The physician's hands that had never protected him but which he no longer hated for failing to accomplish what hands alone could never achieve.

Through the high window, stars were visible—countless and cold, the same stars that had looked down on his grandfather's grandfather, on generations who had hidden their prayers and performed their faith and died anyway because the world did not care about performance or devotion or usefulness, only about blood and who had permission to shed it.

He had released them. Tomás and the inquisitors and the machinery and his own hands and the woman whose eyes watched from corners. Released them all to whatever waited—for them, for him, for the days between now and the fire he knew was coming.

The hatred remained. But he was free of it.

Free to die without rage poisoning the final moments. Free to face whatever came next without carrying the burden forward into new flesh, new life, new chances to learn what this life had finally taught him:

That hatred was a choice. That persecution could destroy the body but could not poison the soul unless the victim drank the poison himself. That release was possible even when forgiveness was not. That setting down the burning coal did not mean accepting what had been done, only refusing to let it continue doing itself inside him long after the external cruelty ended.

Diego closed his eyes. Exhaustion claimed him—not the grinding wakefulness of recent days but something deeper, more restful, the first true sleep since the knock had split his old life from this new truth.

He slept without dreams. Without hatred's heat keeping him wakeful.

Free, in the only way freedom remained possible in this place where every other freedom had been stripped away.

Free to die peacefully. To burn without rage. To carry forward nothing except the question that was already forming in the space where hatred had lived:

If he could release this—the deepest, most justified rage he had ever known—what else might be released? What else was he carrying that did not need to be carried? What other certainties might be questioned, examined, set down when they proved to be burdens rather than truths?

The question would wait. Would carry forward. Would seed what came next, in whatever body the flame found after this one burned.

For now, Diego slept. Released. Ready.

The stars turned overhead, cold and countless, and bore witness to nothing except their own continuation.
