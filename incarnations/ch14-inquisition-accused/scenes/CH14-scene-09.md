They came for him at dawn.

No warning, no summons, but Diego had known. The pattern was clear enough—prisoners who did not confess fully were processed through interrogation, through examination of increasing rigor, and finally through to reconciliation or relaxation to secular authorities. Diego had provided partial confession but refused to name others. The Holy Office's patience, infinite in theory, had limits in practice. The auto-de-fé had been scheduled. His name was on the list.

The guards dressed him in the sanbenito—a yellow tunic painted with flames and demons, the visual catalog of his crimes worn as public declaration. The fabric was coarse against skin gone sensitive from weeks in the cell's darkness. They placed the coroza on his head, a pointed cap that made him a figure of mockery and warning both. His crimes were written there too, in letters large enough to be read from distance: *Heretic. Judaizer. Relapsed.*

Relapsed. The word was technically inaccurate—he had never publicly recanted to relapse from—but accuracy was not the auto-de-fé's purpose. The spectacle required villains, and villains required costuming.

They led him into morning light that struck his eyes like blades after weeks of grey twilight. Toledo's plaza stretched before him, already crowded with citizens who had come to witness God's justice made visible. Merchants. Nobles. Peasants. Families with children perched on shoulders to see better. The auto-de-fé was entertainment and education both—the state's power demonstrated, the Church's authority confirmed, the cost of heresy made manifest in flesh and fire.

Seven stakes had been erected in the plaza's center. Seven condemned. Diego was not alone.

They processed the prisoners in order, reading crimes and sentences with bureaucratic precision. A woman who had kept Jewish dietary laws. A man who had questioned transubstantiation. An old merchant accused of Islamic sympathies. Each name, each crime, each sentence recorded and proclaimed so all would know that the Holy Office's work was thorough, documented, justified by testimony and confession extracted through proper channels.

"Diego de Lucena, physician, convicted of heresy and judaizing practices." The official's voice carried across the plaza, flat and formal. "Having confessed to lighting Sabbath candles, observing Jewish fasts, and speaking Hebrew prayers, but having refused to name accomplices or demonstrate complete repentance, is hereby relaxed to secular authorities for final disposition."

Relaxed. Another euphemism. The Church did not execute—it merely handed condemned prisoners to secular courts who carried out sentences the Church determined but took no responsibility for. The language performed its function, creating distance between holy purpose and profane violence, allowing the inquisitors to burn heretics while maintaining that they shed no blood.

They bound Diego to his stake. The rope cut into his wrists and chest, holding him upright against wood that had been used before—he could smell the char, the residue of previous burnings that stained the timber black in places. Around his feet they piled dry wood and straw, building the pyre with practiced efficiency. Not green wood that would create smoke for slow suffocation. Dry wood that would catch quickly and burn hot. No mercy of strangulation before the flames—that was granted only to those who confessed fully and repented truly. Diego would burn alive.

He felt no fear. The absence startled him for a moment—his physician's mind noting the symptom, diagnosing shock or acceptance or the peculiar peace that sometimes came to the dying when resistance became pointless. But it was not shock. It was the space that had opened in his chest when he released the hatred, the gap between emotion and self that allowed him to observe what was happening without being consumed by it before the flames even caught.

A face in the crowd drew his attention. Tomás de Mendoza stood among the citizens, Rafael beside him. Both wore expressions of carefully maintained neutrality—not celebration, which would seem cruel, but not grief, which might suggest sympathy with the condemned. The correct performance for those who had cooperated with the Holy Office and thereby earned continued safety.

Diego looked at Tomás and felt the hatred's echo—still there, would always be there, but distant now. Observed rather than experienced. He had released Tomás to live with what he had done, and Tomás would live with it. That was enough. More than enough.

Another face appeared at the crowd's edge. The woman in grey. Sor Catalina, her veil drawn forward, her expression grave and pious as she watched the proceedings. Come to pray for the condemned, perhaps. Or to witness the fruit of her counsel, the natural conclusion of testimony she had encouraged through her guidance of Tomás and others whose distress she had eased by directing them toward confession.

She stood very still, her hands folded, her eyes fixed on Diego with that same watching intensity that had troubled him since their first meeting. He did not understand her. Did not know what she was or why her presence made his body respond with dread his mind could not explain. But he released her too. Whatever she was, whatever purpose she served, it was not his burden to carry into death.

A priest approached to hear final confession, offer final rites. Diego accepted the blessing mechanically. Spoke words of repentance that were expected, though whether he meant them or simply performed them one last time, he could not say and did not care. The forms mattered to those watching. To Diego they were simply sounds, ritual that marked the transition from life to death the way his physician's examinations had marked transitions from health to illness.

The priest stepped back. The official nodded to the guards.

They brought the torches.

Heat before pain. Diego felt warmth against his legs first, the straw catching with a sound like breathing, flames rising through dry wood that had been stacked to channel air and maximize burning. Smoke rose—not the thick black smoke of green wood but thin grey that carried the smell of char and something sweetish Diego's physician's mind identified distantly as his own flesh beginning to burn.

The sanbenito caught first. Yellow fabric blackening at its hem, flames crawling upward with patient hunger. Diego watched the fire climb toward his chest and felt... observation. The physician noting symptoms. Temperature increasing. Skin blistering. Pain beginning to register—sharp at first, then overwhelming as nerve endings fired their final messages before heat destroyed them entirely.

His flesh was meat. The recognition arrived with absolute clarity. This body that had healed others, that had carried him through forty-three years of careful performance and usefulness and the exhausting vigilance of converso life—it was meat. Fuel for flames. Organic matter returning to ash and smoke and the elements from which it had been assembled.

The Holy Office could burn this meat. Could reduce it to cinders. Could destroy the physician's careful hands and the body they had never managed to protect.

But they could not make him drink the poison.

The thought arrived through pain that was becoming absolute, that was dissolving his ability to think in anything except fragments. They could burn the flesh. Could not poison the soul. He had released the hatred. Had set down the burning coal before it could burn him from within. Whatever died in these flames, it would die free of the rage that might have kept him bound to this suffering long after the meat stopped burning.

Pain was becoming everything. Diego's vision narrowed, darkened at the edges. Smoke and heat and agony that transcended his physician's ability to categorize or diagnose. He was dying. The process was unmistakable. Irreversible. Final.

And in the spaces between pain, in the moments when consciousness flickered like the flames consuming his legs, a question formed.

Not about hatred. Not about Tomás or the inquisitors or the machinery that had consumed him. The hatred was released. That lesson was learned. The coal set down.

But if he could release that—if he could let go of the most justified rage he had ever known, could set down the burden of hatred earned through betrayal and cruelty and systematic destruction—what else might be released?

What else had he carried that did not need to be carried?

The bargain he had believed in. The faith that usefulness purchased safety. The performance of devotion in exchange for protection that never came. The conviction that the world made sense, that justice existed, that right action earned right result.

All of it. Beliefs he had never questioned because questioning seemed dangerous or pointless or simply unthinkable. Certainties he had built his life upon that had proven not certain at all but merely convenient fictions, stories he told himself to make the world navigable.

If the hatred could be questioned and released, what else?

Everything. The thought arrived with the force of revelation burning brighter than the flames consuming his flesh. Everything could be questioned. Everything was questionable. Every certainty was merely belief wearing certainty's mask. Every truth was true only until examination revealed it as assumption, performance, the story believed into seeming-solid but dissolving under scrutiny.

He could question everything.

The need burned hotter than fire, brighter than pain. A hunger deeper than the body's dying, older than this life, persistent as the soul's urge to understand, to know, to find what was true beneath what was believed.

Somewhere ahead—he could not see it, could only feel it like compass-pull toward distant shore—there was a time when doubt would be permitted. When questions would be tools instead of crimes. When a man might examine every belief, test every certainty, ask *is this true?* without burning for the audacity of inquiry.

When skepticism would be virtue rather than heresy. When nothing would be sacred except the search itself. When even God could be questioned and the questioning would be holy because truth mattered more than comfort, more than tradition, more than the desperate human need for certainty in a world that offered none.

Diego's vision was failing. The plaza darkening. Voices distant. Pain becoming abstract, a condition rather than sensation, the body's final protests before dissolution.

But the question remained. Bright. Clear. Insistent.

*What is true? Not what am I told. Not what is safe to believe. What is actually, demonstrably true?*

The hunger for that question—the need to pursue it without constraint, without danger, without having to perform belief while suspecting doubt—pulled at something in him that was not his body, not his name, not the meat burning at Toledo's stake.

Something that persisted. Something that would continue. Something that needed new flesh, new time, new circumstances where doubt could be pursued to its conclusion and every certainty could be tested against reality until only what survived testing remained.

The urge forward was powerful as gravity, inevitable as flame seeking air. Diego—or what remained of Diego, what had always been more than Diego, what would be someone else in time and place still forming from the ash of this burning—reached toward that future with hunger that transcended the body's dying.

A time of questions. A time of skepticism. A time when *is this true?* would be the beginning of wisdom rather than the beginning of suffering.

The need for that time burned brighter than flesh burning.

Ready to question.

Ready to doubt.

Ready to find what remained when every belief had been examined and every certainty tested and every comfortable lie had been stripped away to reveal the truth beneath—whatever that truth proved to be, however uncomfortable, however strange.

The flames took his breath. His heart stuttered. Failed. The meat that had been Diego de Lucena burned toward ash, and something else—something that had worn his flesh but was not limited to it—burned forward through darkness toward light still gathering, toward a life not yet begun, toward a century where doubt would be permitted and questions would be welcomed and the search for truth would matter more than the safety of unexamined belief.

The hunger pulled him forward like flame toward air.

Ready.

Released.

Burning toward the next lesson, the next flesh, the next chance to learn what this life had finally taught:

That hatred was a choice. That release was possible. That everything—everything—could be questioned.

And in the questioning, freedom.

The darkness took him. The light ahead grew brighter. Somewhere in the space between lives, between the meat burning at a stake and the meat not yet conceived, consciousness burned forward.

Ready to doubt.

Ready to question everything.

Ready.
