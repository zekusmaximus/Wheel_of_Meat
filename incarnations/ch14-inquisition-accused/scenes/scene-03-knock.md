The silence woke him.

Diego lay in darkness, his body rigid beneath wool blankets that suddenly felt too heavy, too confining, like burial shrouds already arranged. Beside him, Inés's breathing continued its steady rhythm—in, out, in, out—but beyond their chamber's walls, beyond the shuttered window and the narrow street outside, the city had gone quiet in a way that was not natural, not right.

No vendors calling the hour. No dogs barking. No footsteps of late workers returning home or early risers beginning their day. The silence was absolute, deliberate, the kind of quiet that came when an entire neighborhood held its breath and waited for violence to pass their doors.

Diego's heart struck against his ribs—once, twice, a drumbeat his physician's mind catalogued even as his body went cold. Elevated pulse. Rapid breathing despite stillness. The symptoms of fear his patients described when they came to him with complaints they could not name, ailments that lived in the space between body and spirit where medicine had no purchase.

He heard the footsteps then. Multiple men. Heavy boots on cobblestones. The measured tread of those who had no need for stealth because they walked with authority's sanction, with documentation signed and sealed, with the certainty that doors would open before them or be opened by force.

The footsteps stopped.

They stopped outside Diego's threshold—neither at a neighboring house nor at Tomás's door across the lane—and in the moment before the knock came, he understood with absolute clarity that his life—the careful construction of usefulness and safety, the performance maintained across decades, the bargain he had made with a world that never agreed to its terms—had just ended.

The knock split the silence like an axe through bone.

Three strikes. Methodical. The sound of duty, not anger. The sound of men doing God's work, or believing they did, which amounted to the same thing.

Beside him, Inés woke with a gasp that she smothered against her palm. Her hand found his in the darkness, her fingers ice-cold, gripping with a strength that would leave bruises. For a moment they lay frozen—two bodies pressed together in the dark, clinging to the last seconds before the world they knew dissolved into whatever waited beyond their door.

"Diego de Lucena." The voice from outside was formal, flat, empty of everything except the words themselves. "Open in the name of the Holy Office of the Inquisition."

Inés's grip tightened until Diego felt his bones compress. He wanted to lie still. He wanted to remain here in the darkness with his wife's hand in his, as though stillness might make him invisible, as though silence might unmake the knock, rewind the footsteps, return him to the dream he had been having before the silence woke him—a dream he could no longer remember but which seemed, in retrospect, almost peaceful.

His body moved without his consent. Training stronger than terror. The physician's habit of responding to need even when the need came dressed as destruction. He rose from bed, his hands finding his robe in the darkness, pulling it around shoulders that felt too thin, too fragile, as though the bones beneath his skin had been replaced with something hollow and brittle.

"I am here," he called. His voice emerged steady—another performance, the last performance, his body playing the role it had rehearsed for decades even as the self behind the performance fractured into pieces too small to name.

He crossed the consultation room in darkness, his feet finding the path by memory. Past the table where he had ground medicines that afternoon. Past the shelf where his father's medical texts stood wrapped in cloth to protect them from dust and prying eyes—Arabic texts that could themselves be evidence of heresy, though every physician in Castile consulted them. Past the brazier's cold ashes. Past the careful order he had maintained, the useful life he had built, the illusion that competence might purchase safety.

His hand reached for the door's bolt.

Inés appeared beside him, her veil thrown hastily over her nightshift, her face bone-white in the pre-dawn grey seeping through the shutters. She placed her hand over his on the bolt. The last touch of his ordinary life. The last moment when they were still who they had been—physician and wife, converso and converso, careful people who had committed no crime except being born into bodies that carried the wrong blood.

"I love you," she whispered.

Diego could not answer. The words locked in his throat, too large to pass, too weighted with everything unsaid across twenty years of marriage lived in performance and fear. He touched his free hand to her face—felt the wetness of silent tears—and then drew back the bolt.

The door swung open.

Three men stood in the grey light. Familiares of the Holy Office, identified by the white crosses stitched to their black cloaks. Behind them, the street lay empty and watching. Every shutter closed. Every door barred. Every neighbor who might have called greeting or offered help now pressed against their own walls, grateful the knock had not come for them, already forgetting Diego's name lest remembering it later prove dangerous.

The lead familiar was older, his face weathered and expressionless, performing duty with the same mechanical precision Diego had seen in soldiers and executioners and men whose work required them to stop thinking of their subjects as human. He held a rolled parchment bearing the Inquisition's seal.

"Diego de Lucena, physician, resident of this house?"

"I am he."

"You are summoned to appear before the Holy Office to answer charges of heresy and judaizing practices, brought against you by testimony of reliable witnesses and investigation conducted in accordance with Holy Mother Church's sacred duty to preserve the purity of faith." The words came without inflection, a script performed so many times it had worn grooves into the speaker's tongue. "You will come with us now. You will speak to no one. You will take nothing. You will submit yourself to examination and, should God grant you grace, to the cleansing of confession."

Diego's mind catalogued the details even as his body went numb. Reliable witnesses. Judaizing practices. The specificity of the charges meant testimony—detailed testimony, offered by someone who knew the intimate patterns of his household. Someone who had sat at Friday tables. Someone who had shared the forbidden prayers.

Tomás. It had to be Tomás. The Holy Office had questioned Rafael about his father, had questioned Tomás about his associates, and Tomás had chosen his son over his friend. The choice was understandable. Inevitable. Unforgivable.

"May I dress?" Diego asked.

"You will come as you are."

One of the younger familiares stepped forward with a length of rope. The Holy Office used rope rather than chains through public streets, avoiding spectacle in its arrests. The restraint was almost gentle, a formality rather than a weapon, the rope looped around Diego's wrists with the care a physician might use binding a wound.

Diego looked at Inés. She stood in the doorway, her hand pressed to her mouth, her eyes wide and dry now, shock burning away tears. He wanted to tell her to run, to leave Toledo, to find her sister in Córdoba and deny everything. But the familiares would be watching. They would question her. They would ask what a physician's wife knew of her husband's practices, what prayers she had heard, what candles she had lit.

She was already condemned. They both were. The only question was whether the condemnation would spread to encompass her as well, or whether being the betrayed rather than the betrayer might purchase her survival.

"God will protect the innocent," she said. Loud enough for the familiares to hear. Loud enough to be recorded when they made their reports. "I have lived in Christian faith. I have attended Mass. I have done nothing to offend Holy Mother Church."

It was the right script. The necessary denial. Diego heard the plea beneath the words—*believe me, save yourself, do not take me with you into the fire.*

He could give her nothing except silence. The familiares were already turning, already guiding him into the street with hands that pressed against his shoulders but did not push, that directed without violence, that performed the courtesy of treating him as though he still deserved the dignity accorded to human beings rather than heretics awaiting cleansing.

The street remained empty as they walked. Empty of bodies but full of watching—Diego could feel the eyes behind every shutter, the held breath of neighbors who knew him, who had bought his medicines, who had shared the same Quarter and the same fear and the same calculation that now kept them hidden lest association prove contagious.

The sky was lightening. Dawn would break within the hour. The city would wake and go about its business, and Diego's absence would be noted, remarked upon, accepted. *The physician has been taken. He must have been guilty. The Holy Office does not err. God's will be done.*

They passed Tomás's house. The door stood closed. The shutters drawn. No sign of life within. But as they walked past, Diego glimpsed movement—a shape behind the upper window's slats, a face pressed close to see without being seen.

Tomás. Watching the consequences of his testimony. Witnessing the friend he had condemned being led away to imprisonment and interrogation and, if confession did not come quickly enough, to suffering designed to encourage the soul's cleansing through the body's breaking.

A feeling stirred in Diego's chest. The seed from which hatred might grow—though not quite hatred yet. The recognition that Tomás had chosen. That the choice might have been impossible, might have been understandable, but had still been made. That Diego walked toward imprisonment while Tomás watched from safety purchased with betrayal.

The seed found fertile ground. Diego felt it take root somewhere beneath his ribs, in the space where the physician's calm had always lived, where steadiness had been cultivated across decades of practice. The root pushed down and down, finding purchase in soil that had been prepared—without his knowledge, without his consent—by forty-three years of swallowed rage, suppressed grief, and the exhaustion of performing faith in a God whose Church wanted him dead.

They turned a corner. Tomás's house disappeared from view.

Diego touched his thumb to his index finger, then his middle finger, then his ring finger, then his smallest finger. The sequence that steadied his hands before difficult work. The physician's ritual.

His hands did not steady. They shook against the rope binding his wrists, trembling with cold and fear and the first stirrings of something darker—something that whispered that hatred might be the only honest response to this world, the only true recognition of what men did to each other in God's name, the only reaction that acknowledged the weight of what was being done to him.

The prison gates opened ahead. Iron-bound wood, black with age and stained with a darkness Diego did not examine too closely. Beyond the gates lay corridors he could not see, cells he had only heard described, machinery of persuasion he knew existed but had never witnessed.

He was a physician. He understood anatomy. He knew what the strappado did to shoulders, what the toca did to lungs, what the potro did to joints and ligaments and the small bones of hands that had spent decades learning to heal.

The gates closed behind him with a sound like finality. Like a door sealing a tomb.

Like the first sound of a new world where all his careful usefulness meant nothing, and the only currency that mattered was whatever truth might be extracted from flesh too weak to hold secrets when properly motivated to release them.
