# Scene 4: The Processing

---

They took him to a room that smelled of ink and parchment and something else—something organic and sour that Diego's physician's nose identified as fear-sweat absorbed into stone over decades of use. A table stood against one wall, its surface scarred with the marks of countless pens and stained dark in places where ink had spilled and never been cleaned. Behind the table sat a man in the black robes of the Holy Office, his face narrow and bloodless, his hands moving across parchment with the mechanical precision of someone who had written the same words so many times they required no thought.

A scribe. Not an inquisitor. Diego felt the distinction settle in his chest—a small relief that shamed him even as he grasped at it. The scribe was only recording information, only creating the file that would contain Diego's existence reduced to questions and answers, accusations and denials, the administrative framework within which his guilt would be established and his punishment determined.

Only. As though reducing a life to parchment were a small thing.

"Name." The scribe did not look up. His quill scratched across parchment, forming letters in a hand so regular it might have been printed.

"Diego de Lucena."

Scratch. Scratch. The quill moved like a living thing, translating voice into permanent record, converting the spoken into the written where it could be examined and re-examined, used and reused, compared against other testimony until contradictions emerged or patterns became visible that could not be seen in the moment of questioning.

"Occupation."

"Physician."

The scribe's eyebrow rose—the first expression Diego had seen on the bloodless face. "Physician." He made a note in the margin. "You read Latin?"

"Yes."

"Arabic?"

The trap was obvious even through Diego's exhaustion. Physicians studied Arabic texts—Avicenna, Averroes, the great medical authorities whose work formed the foundation of healing knowledge throughout Christendom. But Arabic was also the language of Islam, and Islam was heresy's cousin, and knowledge of heretical languages might suggest sympathy with heretical thoughts.

"The medical authorities," Diego said. His voice remained steady despite the tightness in his throat. "As required for my profession. Under proper guidance of Christian teaching."

Scratch. Scratch. The quill recorded the answer and, Diego suspected, the hesitation before it. Everything could be used. Everything would be used. The Holy Office was patient, methodical, and infinite in its capacity to find meaning in the spaces between words.

"Place of birth."

"Toledo."

"Parish."

"San Bartolomé."

"Parents' names."

Diego provided them. His father, dead fifteen years. His mother, dead in childbirth when Diego was seven. Both converso. Both baptized. Both buried in Christian ground with Christian rites. Both marked, always, by the blood that made their devotion suspect and their children's devotion suspect unto the third and fourth generation.

The questions continued. When had he married? To whom? What were her parents' names? Her grandparents'? The scribe mapped Diego's genealogy with the same dispassion he might bring to cataloguing inventory—so many bushels of wheat, so many yards of cloth, so much converso blood running through how many suspect veins.

"Possessions."

Diego blinked. "I was not permitted to bring—"

"What possessions do you own? Property, goods, chattels. The Holy Office records all property of the accused to ensure proper accounting."

To ensure confiscation, Diego understood but did not say. If he were convicted—when he were convicted, the assumption ran beneath every question like water beneath ice—his property would be seized. His house. His medical instruments. His father's books. Everything he owned would become the Inquisition's property, sold to fund the machinery that had consumed him.

"A house in the Quarter," Diego said. His tongue felt thick, the words emerging with effort. "Medical instruments. Books. Household goods."

"Books." The scribe made another margin note. "What books?"

"Medical texts. Galen. Hippocrates. Avicenna." Each title felt like an admission, though every physician owned these works, though Christian universities taught from them. But ownership was not the same as innocence, and the scribe's quill scratched endlessly, converting each answer into evidence that could be interpreted, reinterpreted, used to construct whatever narrative the inquisitors required.

"Other books?"

"A Bible. Prayer books." Both true. Both insufficient. Both marked now by the fact that Diego had listed them second, after the medical texts, as though his profession mattered more than his faith—a small slip, a tiny crack in the performance, already recorded and unretractable.

The scribe set down his quill and looked at Diego directly for the first time. His eyes were grey and empty as winter sky. "You understand the charges against you?"

"Heresy and judaizing practices. But I do not—"

"The charges have been brought by reliable witnesses. Their testimony has been examined and found credible. You will be given opportunity to confess. The Holy Office extends mercy to those who confess fully and without reservation. Those who persist in denial face examination of greater rigor." The words emerged in the same flat tone, a script delivered without inflection or emphasis, as though describing a process for curing leather or preparing mortar. "Do you understand?"

Diego's mouth had gone dry. He understood. Confession purchased mercy—a quicker death, perhaps, or reconciliation if the sins were minor enough and the confession complete enough. Denial purchased torture. The strappado. The toca. The potro. Examination of greater rigor.

"I understand," he whispered.

"Good." The scribe returned to his parchment. "You will be housed in solitary confinement pending interrogation. You will speak to no one. You will have no communication with any person save your interrogators. Prayer is permitted. Denial of God's mercy is forbidden. The Holy Office seeks only truth. Confession cleanses the soul. Remember this."

A guard appeared at Diego's elbow—one of the familiares who had walked him through Toledo's silent streets. The interview was over. Diego had been processed, recorded, reduced to entries in a ledger that would survive long after his body had burned to ash or rotted in prison or been broken on the machinery of persuasion the Holy Office employed to save souls by destroying the flesh that housed them.

They led him down corridors that stank of stone and human waste and centuries of suffering compressed into walls that wept moisture in the dim light of torches set at intervals too far apart to fully banish darkness. Other prisoners were visible through iron grates—shapes hunched or sprawled, faces turned toward walls or pressed against bars, mouths open in prayer or screaming or the slack-jawed silence of those who had passed beyond screaming into some interior country where language no longer reached.

Diego's physician's mind catalogued symptoms despite his terror. Malnutrition. Infection. Untreated wounds. Bodies left to fester in darkness until confession came or death provided the mercy the Holy Office would not grant until its work was complete.

His cell was barely larger than a closet. Stone walls on three sides. Iron grate for a door. A thin straw pallet against one wall. A bucket in the corner whose purpose was obvious and whose smell suggested it had not been emptied in recent memory. A window high on the back wall, too small and too high to reach, admitting only a sliver of grey light that might have been dawn or dusk or simply the permanent twilight of this place where day and night lost meaning.

The gate clanged shut. The lock turned.

Diego stood in the center of the cell, his robe still clutched around shoulders that would not stop shaking. The stone floor was cold beneath his bare feet. The walls pressed close, intimate as a coffin, close enough that if he extended his arms he could touch both sides at once.

He lowered himself to the pallet. The straw crunched beneath his weight, releasing the smell of mildew and old urine. He touched his fingers together in sequence—index, middle, ring, smallest—the physician's ritual, the steadying gesture that had served him through difficult surgeries and dying patients and forty-three years of careful control.

His hands would not steady.

He sat in the dim cell, his hands trembling in his lap, and understood with a clarity that felt almost clinical—the physician observing his own dissolution—that he had been wrong. Usefulness had purchased nothing. Careful performance had protected no one. The bargain he had built his life upon had never existed except in his own desperate need to believe that competence might armor him against a world that wanted his blood regardless of his skill.

He was meat now. Meat to be processed, examined, persuaded through the application of carefully documented pain to confess sins he might or might not have committed, to name names he might or might not know, to cleanse his soul through the breaking of his body.

The physician who had spent decades learning to heal could do nothing for himself except sit in darkness and wait for the machinery to grind forward, patient and methodical and utterly convinced of its righteousness, reducing him increment by increment to the raw material from which confession could be extracted and God's will—or the Inquisition's interpretation thereof—could be done.
