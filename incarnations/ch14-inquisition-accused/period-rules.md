# Period Rules: ch14-inquisition-spain

A historical chapter in which Silas incarnates as an accused converso facing the Spanish Inquisition. Genre: psychological horror + investigative procedural.

---

## Historical Setting

### Period

1480–1492 CE — the foundational, most ferocious phase of the Spanish Inquisition, beginning with Ferdinand II and Isabella I establishing the tribunal (1478) and climaxing in the Alhambra Decree of 1492, which expelled Spain's Jewish population.

### Location

Castile or Aragon, with flexibility to anchor scenes in:

- **Toledo or Seville** — early epicenters of inquisitorial trials and autos-de-fé
- **Converso districts** — marked by enforced restrictions, distinctive badges, and surveillance of everyday life
- **Inquisitorial facilities** — prisons, interrogation chambers, solitary cells
- **Public squares** — used for processions and autos-de-fé (spectacle + deterrent)

### Year

**1491** — immediately before Granada's fall (January 1492) and the issuance of the Alhambra Decree (March 1492).

This places the avatar directly in the tightening vise of religious uniformity, political consolidation, and mass suspicion. Persecution sharply increased in the immediate run-up to 1492.

## Genre: Psychological Horror + Procedural Suspense

This chapter must feel suffocating, paranoid, and intimate. Horror is psychological, not graphic.

### Key Genre Conventions

**Paranoia-as-atmosphere:** Every action, word, gesture feels surveilled. People behave as if observed even when alone.

**Thought-crime tension:** The Inquisition polices belief, intention, and rumor; "heresy" becomes an invisible contagion.

**False certainty:** Interrogators insist truth is already known; confession becomes performance under duress.

**Social fracturing:** Distrust among neighbors, families, guilds; denunciation as a weapon.

**Procedural dread:** The chapter should incorporate the mechanics of accusation, detention, interrogation, and spectacle without glorification.

**Identity horror:** Conversos and moriscos live double lives, masking traditions and performing Catholic orthodoxy.

**Institutional horror:** The terror of a system that is meticulous, bureaucratic, and utterly convinced of its righteousness.

## Historical Constraints

### Technology & Material Culture

**Transportation:** Foot, mule, or horse; restrictions forbid conversos from riding mules.

**Lighting:** Candles, torches, oil lamps; interrogation rooms dim by design.

**Weapons:** Guards carry swords, daggers, staves.

**Instruments of torture** (non-graphic reference only):
- *Strappado* — hanging by wrists, joints dislocate
- *Toca* — water torture (proto-waterboarding)
- *Potro / the rack* — stretching ligaments until tearing

**Record-keeping:** Inquisitors keep meticulous ledgers, deposition notes, denunciation records, and confessional transcripts.

**Clothing:** Conversos forbidden costly garments; nobles display ostentatious wealth—sharp visual hierarchy.

### Social Structure & Law

**Church–State fusion:** Blurred lines between ecclesiastical and secular authority; heretics formally punished by secular courts after conviction.

**Conversos & Moriscos:**
- Forced to live in segregated districts
- Must display Catholic piety publicly (attend Mass, avoid Jewish/Muslim customs)
- Experience constant fear of exposure and denunciation

**Suspicion economy:**
- Neighbors denounce neighbors
- Anonymous accusations accepted
- Silence or association with accused persons is dangerous

**Public ritual:** Autos-de-fé as theatrical, state-sanctioned performances of authority.

### Language Rules

**Vernacular:** Late Medieval Castilian Spanish.

**Formal speech (Inquisitors):** Ecclesiastical Latin terms mixed into Castilian judicial phrasing.

**Social markers:**
- Conversos avoid Hebrew or Arabic terms even privately—fear of slips
- Religious formulae ("Dios mediante," "Que Dios te perdone") used reflexively and strategically

**Writing conventions:**
- No modern psychological vocabulary ("trauma," "anxiety," "paranoia")—convey through behavior and sensation
- Avoid anachronistic critiques of the Church; critique arises through lived experience
- Keep diction grave, formal, oppressive

## Lilith: Power Level and Constraints

### Power Level

**Sustained Presence** — Lilith can inhabit and steer her own past incarnation for extended periods. This is the same mechanism used in Chapter 12 with the Heian Attendant.

She cannot possess random people. She can only work through a vessel that shares her soul-pattern—one of her own past lives present in this time period.

### Hard Constraints

**No direct interaction with Silas/Diego.** Lilith cannot speak to, touch, or directly communicate with the protagonist. This limitation holds until Chapter 21. She can only:
- Steer her vessel to create circumstances
- Arrange the environment
- Influence others who then affect Diego
- Be present in ways he may notice but not understand

**Steering or watching, not both.** When actively pushing her vessel, she loses witness-clarity. When watching clearly, she cannot steer. (Established in CH13.)

**Period vocabulary only.** Any influence she exerts must work through period-appropriate channels—she cannot inject modern concepts.

### What She CAN Do

- Inhabit a past incarnation of herself present in 1491 Toledo
- Through that vessel, manipulate circumstances around Diego
- Position herself where Diego might observe her vessel (from a distance, through bars, etc.)
- Influence third parties who then interact with Diego
- Create environmental pressures designed to cultivate hatred

## Scene Requirements

### Non-Negotiable Elements

**Atmosphere of unrelenting suspicion:**
- Show social surveillance—glances, shuttered windows, quick silences
- The avatar performs Catholic orthodoxy while internally fragmenting
- Every relationship is potentially a denunciation waiting to happen

**Identity tension:**
- The avatar lives between two selves: the performed Catholic, the suppressed heritage
- This fracture is the ground on which hatred could grow—self-hatred or hatred of persecutors

**Procedural dread:**
- At least one scene must depict the formal machinery: interrogation room, scribe recording testimony, processing of accusations
- The bureaucratic precision of cruelty should be felt

**Hatred as the test:**
- The spiritual question of the chapter: Can he endure this without being consumed by hatred?
- The chapter must show hatred as a genuine temptation—not easily dismissed

**Death scene / karmic bridge:**
- The avatar's final insight must relate to releasing ill-will
- Death should come with hatred released, not suppressed—genuine peace, not resignation
- This seeds the questioning capacity needed for Renaissance skepticism (doubt without bitterness)

### Forbidden

- Graphic torture descriptions (psychological horror only; aftermath and anticipation, not the act)
- Anachronistic critiques of the Church; critique arises through lived experience
- Lilith speaking directly to Diego or interacting with him face-to-face
- Easy forgiveness—the release of hatred must be earned through genuine confrontation with its weight
- Martyrdom-as-defiance—the death must be peaceful, not triumphant

## Thematic Targets

**Fear transforms communities into instruments of oppression.**
The Inquisition works because neighbors fear neighbors. The system requires—and generates—universal suspicion.

**Identity under surveillance becomes unstable, performative.**
The avatar cannot simply "be himself" because there is no safe self to be. Performance becomes survival.

**Systems built on "purity" inevitably consume the innocent.**
The logic of purity has no natural stopping point. Everyone becomes suspect.

**Spiritual progress requires confronting hatred fully—not suppressing it.**
The avatar cannot release ill-will by pretending he doesn't feel it. He must feel its full weight, understand its temptation, and choose to set it down.

**The healer who cannot heal himself.**
Diego's identity as physician creates specific dramatic possibilities around helplessness, care, and the limits of service.

## Continuity Notes

### From Chapter 12 (Heian/Kaoru)

Kaoru learned: "To endure what is real. That is enough. That is everything." He released the need for illusion and accepted impermanence, including his own death.

Diego inherits this capacity. He can face hard truths without flinching. What he has NOT yet learned is how to face *injustice*—cruelty inflicted by others—without being poisoned by hatred. Kaoru's test was aesthetic/existential; Diego's test is moral/interpersonal.

### To Chapter 16 (Renaissance Skeptic)

The release of hatred—the discovery that one can endure terrible things without being consumed—seeds the capacity for genuine inquiry. A mind freed from bitterness can question without cynicism. The Renaissance skeptic will doubt everything, but from curiosity rather than rage.

### Lilith's Arc

This is her sixth intervention across his lifetimes. Her power has grown from remote influence to sustained vessel-steering. The pattern of backfires continues—but from Diego's POV, we see only her actions, not her internal state. Her perspective will be shown in Chapter 15.
