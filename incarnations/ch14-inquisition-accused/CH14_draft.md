# Scene 1: The Performance of Safety

---

The compound smelled of ground cloves and something bitter Diego could not name, though he had ground these ingredients a hundred times before. His mortar sat on the consultation room's table, its stone bowl stained brown from years of work. Afternoon light slanted through the shuttered window, striping the table in bands of gold and shadow that shifted with the autumn wind outside.

Diego touched his thumb to his index finger, then his middle finger, then his ring finger, then his smallest finger. The sequence steadied his hands as he measured the powder—two parts clove, one part willow bark, a half-part of dried gentian. The merchant would arrive within the hour. Don Cristóbal de Silva, whose gout had troubled him through three winters and who paid well for relief, though never quite enough to forget that Diego was converso and therefore useful only as long as his usefulness outweighed his heritage.

The door to the street stood open, as it always did. An open door welcomed patients. An open door suggested nothing to hide. An open door performed the transparency expected of those whose blood marked them as perpetually suspect, no matter how many generations had passed since their grandparents had accepted the baptismal water.

Diego pressed the pestle against the mortar's curve. The powder released its scent—medicinal, clean, the smell of a physician's careful work. He had learned this trade from his father, who had learned it from his father, and each generation had learned alongside the herbs and compounds the more essential lesson: *Be valuable. Be careful. Be safe.*

A shadow crossed the threshold.

"Physician." Don Cristóbal's voice carried the particular warmth reserved for servants who knew their place—cordial enough to suggest Christian charity, distant enough to confirm the gulf between Old Christian merchant and New Christian tradesman. "I trust you have prepared the remedy."

"As always, Don Cristóbal." Diego set down the pestle and touched his fingers together in sequence once more—index, middle, ring, smallest—before reaching for a cloth to wrap the prepared compound. The gesture was automatic, a physician's habit of checking his steadiness before handling medicines. Or that was how he explained it to himself. "The formula that has served you well these past months. Mix one measure in warmed wine, morning and evening. The inflammation should ease within the week."

Don Cristóbal took the wrapped package, his fingers brushing Diego's palm as he placed the coins there. Three reales. The usual payment. Fair enough for the work, though Diego had treated a priest's sister the month prior for the same complaint and received five. The difference was understood. The difference was never discussed.

"You are skilled, physician. God has gifted you with healing hands." The merchant smiled. "Though I wonder you do not attend Mass more often. I see you at the Cathedral, of course—but a man of such gifts might show greater devotion."

The room grew colder, though the brazier still burned in the corner. Diego felt the shift in his chest first, then his throat—a tightening that might have been fear if fear were permitted, but fear implied guilt, and guilt implied something to hide, and so the tightness remained unnamed.

"I attend as my work permits, Don Cristóbal. The sick do not observe the hours of prayer."

"Of course, of course." Don Cristóbal's smile did not waver. "I meant no offense. Only that devotion protects us all. In these uncertain times, it is wise to be seen in the proper places, offering the proper prayers." He tucked the package into his cloak. "The Holy Office does God's work, but men can be mistaken in their judgments. Best to leave no room for such mistakes."

"Sound counsel." Diego's voice remained steady, a performance his body had learned through years of practice. His hands did not shake. They rested on the table's edge, fingers aligned, the physician's careful composure intact.

The merchant left. His footsteps faded down the cobbled street.

Diego stood alone in the striped light. Through the open doorway, he could see the house across the narrow lane—Tomás de Mendoza's house, where Diego had shared Friday evening meals for twenty years, where candles had been lit and prayers spoken in Hebrew, where the old ways persisted in whispers and gestures no neighbor should notice. The shutters on Tomás's upper window were closed. They had been open that morning.

He touched his fingers together in sequence. Index. Middle. Ring. Smallest. The hands were steady. They had always been steady, even when the rest of him trembled with the exhaustion of never stopping, never slipping, never forgetting that usefulness was the only shield thin enough to wear and sturdy enough to matter.

Footsteps approached from the street. Diego turned, already arranging his face into the expression of welcome appropriate for the next patient, the next performance, the next careful transaction in a life built on the faith that service would purchase safety, that healing would earn protection, that being valuable meant being valuable enough to keep alive.

His wife Inés appeared in the doorway instead, her face pale beneath her veil.

"Diego." She kept her voice low. "Tomás's son has been arrested."

The room did not spin. The walls did not close. Diego's hands touched the table's edge and remained there, steady as always, while something beneath his ribs—something he had learned not to name—went very still.

"What charges?"

"Debts. A brawl in the market." Inés stepped closer, her eyes searching his face for the reaction he had trained himself never to show. "Criminal charges. But Rafael is Tomás's eldest. If they question him—"

She did not need to finish. If they questioned Rafael, they would ask about his father. If they asked about his father, they would ask about those who visited his father's house. If they asked about those visitors, names would be spoken. Diego's name. Inés's name. The names of everyone who had shared Friday bread and remembered what was supposed to have been forgotten.

"Has Tomás sent word?"

"No." Inés's hands twisted in her veil. "But Sor Catalina visited his house this morning. I saw her leaving as I returned from market."

Something cold moved through Diego's chest—not fear, because fear was not permitted, but a cousin to fear, a shadow-feeling he could not quite dismiss. Sor Catalina. The beata known throughout Toledo for her visions and her counsel. A holy woman sought by nobles and peasants alike, who spoke with the certainty of one who believed herself an instrument of God's will.

Diego had seen her in the streets. Dark hair beneath her veil, a particular stillness in how she moved, eyes that seemed to look through the surface of things to some truth beneath. He had never liked her. Could not say why. The dislike had no rational source—she had never spoken to him, never acknowledged his existence. But something about her face made his skin tighten, made the breath catch in his throat as though he stood at the edge of some precipice he could not see.

"What would Sor Catalina want with Tomás?"

"She counsels those in distress." Inés's voice carried an edge Diego recognized—the particular wariness that came from living always on guard, always watching, always aware that survival meant reading the spaces between words. "They say she helps people confess their burdens. That the Holy Office values her guidance."

The brazier hissed. A log settled, sending up a small shower of sparks that died before they reached the floor.

Diego touched his fingers together in sequence. Index. Middle. Ring. Smallest. The physician's ritual. The steadying gesture. The performance of control when control was the only currency that mattered.

"I should visit Tomás."

"Diego—" Inés caught his wrist. Her grip was tight enough to hurt. "Association with trouble is dangerous. If Rafael is questioned, if names are spoken—being seen with Tomás now might be remembered later."

She was right. She was always right. Caution had kept them alive when bolder families had burned. Silence had kept them safe when speech had condemned others. The calculus was simple: protect yourself first, because no one else would.

Diego looked at his wife's hand on his wrist. Her fingers were red from work, the nails broken from washing and cooking and the thousand small labors required to maintain a household without servants. She had married him knowing what it meant to be converso, knowing the fear would never end, knowing that every day was a performance and every performance might still fail.

"I will be careful," he said.

It was the only promise he could offer, and they both knew it was worth nothing at all.

# Scene 2: The Holy Woman

---

Evening came early in autumn, the sun sliding behind Toledo's western walls and leaving the streets in premature dusk. Diego walked through the converso quarter with his medical bag against his side, its leather strap cutting a familiar groove into his shoulder. The narrow lanes smelled of cooking fires and waste, of lives compressed into too-small spaces where neighbors knew too much about each other and silence was the only privacy anyone possessed.

He had not gone to Tomás's house. Inés's warning had been clear, and caution had served him well through forty-three years of performing safety. But the unease sat in his chest like undigested bread, heavy and sour, and so he walked instead—past the shuttered shops, past the fountain where women gathered to wash clothes and exchange whispers, past the church of San Bartolomé where he would attend Mass tomorrow morning as he did every Sunday, his presence noted, his devotion documented by the eyes that never stopped watching.

A figure stood in the shadow of the church's western wall.

Diego's feet slowed before his mind registered why. The woman wore the simple grey habit of a beata, her veil drawn forward to shadow her face. She stood motionless, hands folded at her waist, her attention fixed on something Diego could not see—or perhaps on nothing at all, the stillness of prayer or vision or some interior conversation that excluded the world entire.

He knew her. Everyone in Toledo knew Sor Catalina. The holy woman who had visions, who counseled the troubled, who spoke with bishops and beggars alike in the same measured voice. She had come to the converso quarter three months ago, taking up residence in a small house near the Plaza de Zocodover, and since then her presence had become a fixture—always watching, always available, always accompanied by whispers about those she had helped find their way back to God's grace.

Diego should have walked past. A physician had no business with a beata, no reason to draw attention to himself by acknowledging her. But his feet stopped, and he found himself standing ten paces from her shadow, close enough to see the line of her profile against the church's pale stone.

She turned her head.

The veil fell back slightly, and Diego saw her face. Dark hair drawn back severely from a widow's peak. A single thick strand had escaped and fell across her left temple, darker than the rest, catching what little light remained in the street. Her eyes were difficult to read in the dusk—one seemed lighter than the other, or perhaps it was the angle, a trick of shadow that made the left eye appear to hold some pale crescent where no crescent should exist.

She smiled. The expression did not touch her eyes.

"Physician." Her voice was soft, musical even, though something in its steadiness made Diego think of still water over deep mud. "You walk late."

"Patients do not observe the hours of prayer." The answer came automatically, the same response he had given Don Cristóbal that afternoon, the same shield of usefulness he wore against all questions.

"No." Sor Catalina's gaze did not waver. "They do not. And yet you carry your bag but visit no one. Perhaps you walk to think. Or perhaps you walk to avoid thinking."

The unease in Diego's chest sharpened into something colder. He had never spoken to this woman, never been closer to her than across a plaza or at the edge of a crowd. She should not know him well enough to read his habits, should not have noticed his movements through streets where hundreds moved daily.

"I walk for air," he said.

"Of course." She inclined her head, the gesture graceful and somehow mocking at once, as though she humored him by accepting the lie. "The air in the quarter is foul with smoke. A man needs clean breath to do his work."

Diego's hand found the strap of his medical bag. His fingers tightened against the leather, steadying himself the way his physician's hands steadied when preparing a difficult suture.

"You visited the house of Tomás de Mendoza this morning."

It was not a question. Sor Catalina spoke as though stating a fact already known, already recorded, already part of some accounting Diego could not see but whose weight he felt pressing against his ribs.

"I counsel those in distress," she continued. Her smile remained fixed, gentle, terrible in its gentleness. "Tomás suffers greatly. His son has been arrested. He fears for Rafael's soul—and for his own. The burden of sin weighs heavy on a man, physician. Confession cleanses. This is what the Holy Office teaches. This is what I help men understand."

Diego's throat had gone dry. He wanted to ask what Tomás had said, what sins he had confessed, what names he had spoken in his distress. But the questions themselves would be admissions—of shared secrets, of common guilt, of the Friday candles and Hebrew prayers that linked their households in ways the Inquisition existed to uncover.

"Tomás is a good man," Diego managed.

"All men believe themselves good." Sor Catalina took a step forward. The movement was unhurried, almost floating, as though she moved through water instead of air. "But goodness requires truth, physician. The soul cannot be clean while it harbors deception. Would you not agree? You, whose work is to heal—do you not understand that hidden infection must be drawn out before the flesh can mend?"

She stood three paces away now, close enough that Diego could see her face clearly despite the failing light. Something about her features pulled at him—not recognition, exactly, but a deeper unease, as though he had seen this face before in a dream he could not remember, as though this woman's eyes had looked at him from some other time, some other place, with the same watching stillness that made his skin draw tight across his shoulders.

"I understand that healing requires care," Diego said. His voice remained steady, though the steadiness cost him something he could not name. "And that good physicians do not cause unnecessary pain."

"How kind you are." Sor Catalina's smile widened slightly, and for a moment Diego was certain—absolutely certain—that beneath the expression lay something colder than Toledo stone, older than the church behind her, patient as a hunter watching prey circle back into range. "But perhaps some pain is necessary. Perhaps God sends suffering to test us, to burn away the dross and reveal the pure metal beneath. The Holy Office understands this. Confession is a mercy, even when it comes through fire."

She reached out as though to touch his arm, then stopped, her hand suspended between them. The gesture was casual, meaningless, but Diego's body recoiled before his mind could stop it. He stepped back, the medical bag swinging against his hip.

Sor Catalina lowered her hand. Her expression did not change, but something flickered in those strange eyes—amusement, perhaps, or satisfaction. The recognition of fear.

"Walk carefully, physician," she said. "These are uncertain times. The sick are everywhere, and not all sickness is of the body. Some infections run deeper." She drew her veil forward again, shadowing her face. "I will pray for you. And for those you love."

She turned and walked toward the darkened plaza, her grey habit blending into evening's shadows until Diego could no longer distinguish her shape from the general darkness gathering in Toledo's narrow streets.

He stood alone outside San Bartolomé, his hand still gripping his medical bag's strap, his breathing shallow and quick despite the stillness of his body. Something had just happened—some transaction, some marking, some notation made in a ledger he would never see. The Holy Office kept meticulous records. Everyone knew this. And Sor Catalina counseled those in distress, helped them confess their burdens, guided them toward the cleansing fire of truth.

Diego touched his fingers together in sequence. Index. Middle. Ring. Smallest. The physician's ritual. The steadying gesture.

His hands shook.

---

That night, Diego dreamed.

In the dream, he stood in his consultation room, but the light was wrong—too bright, too cold, as though the sun had moved closer to earth and burned away all shadows. A woman's face looked at him from across the table. Dark hair. Widow's peak. Eyes that watched without blinking.

He knew her. He did not know her. The certainty and impossibility existed together, two truths that should have canceled each other but instead pressed against his chest until breathing became labor.

She spoke, but he could not hear the words. Her mouth moved, shaping syllables in a language he did not understand—or perhaps in a language he had forgotten, something older than Castilian, older than Hebrew, older than any tongue still spoken in the waking world.

He wanted to run. His feet would not move.

She smiled. The same smile she had worn outside the church. Gentle and terrible, as though she pitied him for something he had not yet done but would inevitably commit.

Her hand reached across the table toward his face—

Diego woke in darkness, his heart hammering against his ribs. Beside him, Inés slept undisturbed, her breathing steady and slow. Through the window, the stars were visible—countless and cold, the same stars that had looked down on his grandfather's grandfather, on generations of men who had hidden their prayers and performed their faith and hoped that usefulness would prove armor enough against the world's suspicion.

He touched his fingers together in sequence. Index. Middle. Ring. Smallest.

The hands were steady now. They were always steady, in the end.

But beneath the steadiness, beneath the performance, beneath the physician's careful calm, something had shifted. Some knowledge he could not name, some recognition his body held that his mind refused.

The woman in grey watched him. She had always been watching. And somewhere in the spaces between waking and dreaming, in the gaps where memory could not quite reach, Diego knew—with the terrible certainty of things felt rather than understood—that she would not stop.

# Scene 3: The Knock

---

The silence woke him.

Diego lay in darkness, his body rigid beneath wool blankets that suddenly felt too heavy, too confining, like burial shrouds already arranged. Beside him, Inés's breathing continued its steady rhythm—in, out, in, out—but beyond their chamber's walls, beyond the shuttered window and the narrow street outside, the city had gone quiet in a way that was not natural, not right.

No vendors calling the hour. No dogs barking. No footsteps of late workers returning home or early risers beginning their day. The silence was absolute, deliberate, the kind of quiet that came when an entire neighborhood held its breath and waited for violence to pass their doors.

Diego's heart struck against his ribs—once, twice, a drumbeat his physician's mind catalogued even as his body went cold. Elevated pulse. Rapid breathing despite stillness. The symptoms of fear his patients described when they came to him with complaints they could not name, ailments that lived in the space between body and spirit where medicine had no purchase.

He heard the footsteps then. Multiple men. Heavy boots on cobblestones. The measured tread of those who had no need for stealth because they walked with authority's sanction, with documentation signed and sealed, with the certainty that doors would open before them or be opened by force.

The footsteps stopped.

Not at a neighboring house. Not at Tomás's door across the lane. They stopped outside Diego's threshold, and in the moment before the knock came, he understood with absolute clarity that his life—the careful construction of usefulness and safety, the performance maintained across decades, the bargain he had made with a world that never agreed to its terms—had just ended.

The knock split the silence like an axe through bone.

Three strikes. Methodical. The sound of duty, not anger. The sound of men doing God's work, or believing they did, which amounted to the same thing.

Beside him, Inés woke with a gasp that she smothered against her palm. Her hand found his in the darkness, her fingers ice-cold, gripping with a strength that would leave bruises. For a moment they lay frozen—two bodies pressed together in the dark, clinging to the last seconds before the world they knew dissolved into whatever waited beyond their door.

"Diego de Lucena." The voice from outside was formal, flat, empty of everything except the words themselves. "Open in the name of the Holy Office of the Inquisition."

Inés's grip tightened until Diego felt his bones compress. He wanted to lie still. He wanted to remain here in the darkness with his wife's hand in his, as though stillness might make him invisible, as though silence might unmake the knock, rewind the footsteps, return him to the dream he had been having before the silence woke him—a dream he could no longer remember but which seemed, in retrospect, almost peaceful.

His body moved without his consent. Training stronger than terror. The physician's habit of responding to need even when the need came dressed as destruction. He rose from bed, his hands finding his robe in the darkness, pulling it around shoulders that felt too thin, too fragile, as though the bones beneath his skin had been replaced with something hollow and brittle.

"I am here," he called. His voice emerged steady—another performance, the last performance, his body playing the role it had rehearsed for decades even as the self behind the performance fractured into pieces too small to name.

He crossed the consultation room in darkness, his feet finding the path by memory. Past the table where he had ground medicines that afternoon. Past the shelf where his father's medical texts stood wrapped in cloth to protect them from dust and prying eyes—Arabic texts that could themselves be evidence of heresy, though every physician in Castile consulted them. Past the brazier's cold ashes. Past the careful order he had maintained, the useful life he had built, the illusion that competence might purchase safety.

His hand reached for the door's bolt.

Inés appeared beside him, her veil thrown hastily over her nightshift, her face bone-white in the pre-dawn grey seeping through the shutters. She placed her hand over his on the bolt. The last touch of his ordinary life. The last moment when they were still who they had been—physician and wife, converso and converso, careful people who had committed no crime except being born into bodies that carried the wrong blood.

"I love you," she whispered.

Diego could not answer. The words locked in his throat, too large to pass, too weighted with everything unsaid across twenty years of marriage lived in performance and fear. He touched his free hand to her face—felt the wetness of tears she had not made sound for—and then drew back the bolt.

The door swung open.

Three men stood in the grey light. Familiares of the Holy Office, identified by the white crosses stitched to their black cloaks. Behind them, the street lay empty and watching. Every shutter closed. Every door barred. Every neighbor who might have called greeting or offered help now pressed against their own walls, grateful the knock had not come for them, already forgetting Diego's name lest remembering it later prove dangerous.

The lead familiar was older, his face weathered and expressionless, performing duty with the same mechanical precision Diego had seen in soldiers and executioners and men whose work required them to stop thinking of their subjects as human. He held a rolled parchment bearing the Inquisition's seal.

"Diego de Lucena, physician, resident of this house?"

"I am he."

"You are summoned to appear before the Holy Office to answer charges of heresy and judaizing practices, brought against you by testimony of reliable witnesses and investigation conducted in accordance with Holy Mother Church's sacred duty to preserve the purity of faith." The words came without inflection, a script performed so many times it had worn grooves into the speaker's tongue. "You will come with us now. You will speak to no one. You will take nothing. You will submit yourself to examination and, should God grant you grace, to the cleansing of confession."

Diego's mind catalogued the details even as his body went numb. Reliable witnesses. Judaizing practices. The specificity of the charges meant testimony—detailed testimony, offered by someone who knew the intimate patterns of his household. Someone who had sat at Friday tables. Someone who had shared the forbidden prayers.

Tomás. It had to be Tomás. The Holy Office had questioned Rafael about his father, had questioned Tomás about his associates, and Tomás had chosen his son over his friend. The choice was understandable. Inevitable. Unforgivable.

"May I dress?" Diego asked.

"You will come as you are."

One of the younger familiares stepped forward with a length of rope. Not chains—the Holy Office did not chain its prisoners through public streets, did not make spectacle of arrests. The restraint was almost gentle, a formality rather than a weapon, the rope looped around Diego's wrists with the care a physician might use binding a wound.

Diego looked at Inés. She stood in the doorway, her hand pressed to her mouth, her eyes wide and dry now, shock burning away tears. He wanted to tell her to run, to leave Toledo, to find her sister in Córdoba and deny everything. But the familiares would be watching. They would question her. They would ask what a physician's wife knew of her husband's practices, what prayers she had heard, what candles she had lit.

She was already condemned. They both were. The only question was whether the condemnation would spread to encompass her as well, or whether being the betrayed rather than the betrayer might purchase her survival.

"God will protect the innocent," she said. Loud enough for the familiares to hear. Loud enough to be recorded when they made their reports. "I have lived in Christian faith. I have attended Mass. I have done nothing to offend Holy Mother Church."

It was the right script. The necessary denial. Diego heard the plea beneath the words—*believe me, save yourself, do not take me with you into the fire.*

He could give her nothing except silence. The familiares were already turning, already guiding him into the street with hands that pressed against his shoulders but did not push, that directed without violence, that performed the courtesy of treating him as though he still deserved the dignity accorded to human beings rather than heretics awaiting cleansing.

The street remained empty as they walked. Not empty of people—Diego could feel the eyes behind every shutter, the held breath of neighbors who knew him, who had bought his medicines, who had shared the same Quarter and the same fear and the same calculation that now kept them hidden lest association prove contagious.

The sky was lightening. Dawn would break within the hour. The city would wake and go about its business, and Diego's absence would be noted, remarked upon, accepted. *The physician has been taken. He must have been guilty. The Holy Office does not err. God's will be done.*

They passed Tomás's house. The door stood closed. The shutters drawn. No sign of life within. But as they walked past, Diego glimpsed movement—a shape behind the upper window's slats, a face pressed close to see without being seen.

Tomás. Watching the consequences of his testimony. Witnessing the friend he had condemned being led away to imprisonment and interrogation and, if confession did not come quickly enough, to suffering designed to encourage the soul's cleansing through the body's breaking.

Something moved in Diego's chest. Not quite hatred—not yet—but the seed from which hatred might grow. The recognition that Tomás had chosen. That the choice might have been impossible, might have been understandable, but had still been made. That Diego walked toward imprisonment while Tomás watched from safety purchased with betrayal.

The seed found fertile ground. Diego felt it take root somewhere beneath his ribs, in the space where the physician's calm had always lived, where steadiness had been cultivated across decades of practice. The root pushed down and down, finding purchase in soil that had been prepared—without his knowledge, without his consent—by forty-three years of swallowed rage, suppressed grief, and the exhaustion of performing faith in a God whose Church wanted him dead.

They turned a corner. Tomás's house disappeared from view.

Diego touched his thumb to his index finger, then his middle finger, then his ring finger, then his smallest finger. The sequence that steadied his hands before difficult work. The physician's ritual.

His hands did not steady. They shook against the rope binding his wrists, trembling with cold and fear and the first stirrings of something darker—something that whispered that hatred might be the only honest response to this world, the only true recognition of what men did to each other in God's name, the only reaction that acknowledged the weight of what was being done to him.

The prison gates opened ahead. Iron-bound wood, black with age and stained with a darkness Diego did not examine too closely. Beyond the gates lay corridors he could not see, cells he had only heard described, machinery of persuasion he knew existed but had never witnessed.

He was a physician. He understood anatomy. He knew what the strappado did to shoulders, what the toca did to lungs, what the potro did to joints and ligaments and the small bones of hands that had spent decades learning to heal.

The gates closed behind him with a sound like finality. Like a door sealing a tomb.

Like the first sound of a new world where all his careful usefulness meant nothing, and the only currency that mattered was whatever truth might be extracted from flesh too weak to hold secrets when properly motivated to release them.

# Scene 4: The Processing

---

They took him to a room that smelled of ink and parchment and something else—something organic and sour that Diego's physician's nose identified as fear-sweat absorbed into stone over decades of use. A table stood against one wall, its surface scarred with the marks of countless pens and stained dark in places where ink had spilled and never been cleaned. Behind the table sat a man in the black robes of the Holy Office, his face narrow and bloodless, his hands moving across parchment with the mechanical precision of someone who had written the same words so many times they required no thought.

A scribe. Not an inquisitor. Diego felt the distinction settle in his chest—a small relief that shamed him even as he grasped at it. The scribe was only recording information, only creating the file that would contain Diego's existence reduced to questions and answers, accusations and denials, the administrative framework within which his guilt would be established and his punishment determined.

Only. As though reducing a life to parchment were a small thing.

"Name." The scribe did not look up. His quill scratched across parchment, forming letters in a hand so regular it might have been printed.

"Diego de Lucena."

Scratch. Scratch. The quill moved like a living thing, translating voice into permanent record, converting the spoken into the written where it could be examined and re-examined, used and reused, compared against other testimony until contradictions emerged or patterns became visible that could not be seen in the moment of questioning.

"Occupation."

"Physician."

The scribe's eyebrow rose—the first expression Diego had seen on the bloodless face. "Physician." He made a note in the margin. "You read Latin?"

"Yes."

"Arabic?"

The trap was obvious even through Diego's exhaustion. Physicians studied Arabic texts—Avicenna, Averroes, the great medical authorities whose work formed the foundation of healing knowledge throughout Christendom. But Arabic was also the language of Islam, and Islam was heresy's cousin, and knowledge of heretical languages might suggest sympathy with heretical thoughts.

"The medical authorities," Diego said. His voice remained steady despite the tightness in his throat. "As required for my profession. Under proper guidance of Christian teaching."

Scratch. Scratch. The quill recorded the answer and, Diego suspected, the hesitation before it. Everything could be used. Everything would be used. The Holy Office was patient, methodical, and infinite in its capacity to find meaning in the spaces between words.

"Place of birth."

"Toledo."

"Parish."

"San Bartolomé."

"Parents' names."

Diego provided them. His father, dead fifteen years. His mother, dead in childbirth when Diego was seven. Both converso. Both baptized. Both buried in Christian ground with Christian rites. Both marked, always, by the blood that made their devotion suspect and their children's devotion suspect unto the third and fourth generation.

The questions continued. When had he married? To whom? What were her parents' names? Her grandparents'? The scribe mapped Diego's genealogy with the same dispassion he might bring to cataloguing inventory—so many bushels of wheat, so many yards of cloth, so much converso blood running through how many suspect veins.

"Possessions."

Diego blinked. "I was not permitted to bring—"

"What possessions do you own? Property, goods, chattels. The Holy Office records all property of the accused to ensure proper accounting."

To ensure confiscation, Diego understood but did not say. If he were convicted—when he were convicted, the assumption ran beneath every question like water beneath ice—his property would be seized. His house. His medical instruments. His father's books. Everything he owned would become the Inquisition's property, sold to fund the machinery that had consumed him.

"A house in the Quarter," Diego said. His tongue felt thick, the words emerging with effort. "Medical instruments. Books. Household goods."

"Books." The scribe made another margin note. "What books?"

"Medical texts. Galen. Hippocrates. Avicenna." Each title felt like an admission, though every physician owned these works, though Christian universities taught from them. But ownership was not the same as innocence, and the scribe's quill scratched endlessly, converting each answer into evidence that could be interpreted, reinterpreted, used to construct whatever narrative the inquisitors required.

"Other books?"

"A Bible. Prayer books." Both true. Both insufficient. Both marked now by the fact that Diego had listed them second, after the medical texts, as though his profession mattered more than his faith—a small slip, a tiny crack in the performance, already recorded and unretractable.

The scribe set down his quill and looked at Diego directly for the first time. His eyes were grey and empty as winter sky. "You understand the charges against you?"

"Heresy and judaizing practices. But I do not—"

"The charges have been brought by reliable witnesses. Their testimony has been examined and found credible. You will be given opportunity to confess. The Holy Office extends mercy to those who confess fully and without reservation. Those who persist in denial face examination of greater rigor." The words emerged in the same flat tone, a script delivered without inflection or emphasis, as though describing a process for curing leather or preparing mortar. "Do you understand?"

Diego's mouth had gone dry. He understood. Confession purchased mercy—a quicker death, perhaps, or reconciliation if the sins were minor enough and the confession complete enough. Denial purchased torture. The strappado. The toca. The potro. Examination of greater rigor.

"I understand," he whispered.

"Good." The scribe returned to his parchment. "You will be housed in solitary confinement pending interrogation. You will speak to no one. You will have no communication with any person save your interrogators. Prayer is permitted. Denial of God's mercy is forbidden. The Holy Office seeks only truth. Confession cleanses the soul. Remember this."

A guard appeared at Diego's elbow—one of the familiares who had walked him through Toledo's silent streets. The interview was over. Diego had been processed, recorded, reduced to entries in a ledger that would survive long after his body had burned to ash or rotted in prison or been broken on the machinery of persuasion the Holy Office employed to save souls by destroying the flesh that housed them.

They led him down corridors that stank of stone and human waste and centuries of suffering compressed into walls that wept moisture in the dim light of torches set at intervals too far apart to fully banish darkness. Other prisoners were visible through iron grates—shapes hunched or sprawled, faces turned toward walls or pressed against bars, mouths open in prayer or screaming or the slack-jawed silence of those who had passed beyond screaming into some interior country where language no longer reached.

Diego's physician's mind catalogued symptoms despite his terror. Malnutrition. Infection. Untreated wounds. Bodies left to fester in darkness until confession came or death provided the mercy the Holy Office would not grant until its work was complete.

His cell was barely larger than a closet. Stone walls on three sides. Iron grate for a door. A thin straw pallet against one wall. A bucket in the corner whose purpose was obvious and whose smell suggested it had not been emptied in recent memory. A window high on the back wall, too small and too high to reach, admitting only a sliver of grey light that might have been dawn or dusk or simply the permanent twilight of this place where day and night lost meaning.

The gate clanged shut. The lock turned.

Diego stood in the center of the cell, his robe still clutched around shoulders that would not stop shaking. The stone floor was cold beneath his bare feet. The walls pressed close, intimate as a coffin, close enough that if he extended his arms he could touch both sides at once.

He lowered himself to the pallet. The straw crunched beneath his weight, releasing the smell of mildew and old urine. He touched his fingers together in sequence—index, middle, ring, smallest—the physician's ritual, the steadying gesture that had served him through difficult surgeries and dying patients and forty-three years of careful control.

His hands would not steady.

He sat in the dim cell, his hands trembling in his lap, and understood with a clarity that felt almost clinical—the physician observing his own dissolution—that he had been wrong. Usefulness had purchased nothing. Careful performance had protected no one. The bargain he had built his life upon had never existed except in his own desperate need to believe that competence might armor him against a world that wanted his blood regardless of his skill.

He was meat now. Meat to be processed, examined, persuaded through the application of carefully documented pain to confess sins he might or might not have committed, to name names he might or might not know, to cleanse his soul through the breaking of his body.

The physician who had spent decades learning to heal could do nothing for himself except sit in darkness and wait for the machinery to grind forward, patient and methodical and utterly convinced of its righteousness, reducing him increment by increment to the raw material from which confession could be extracted and God's will—or the Inquisition's interpretation thereof—could be done.

# Scene 5: The Source

---

Time lost meaning in the cell. Meals arrived through the grate's slot—bread hard enough to crack teeth, water that tasted of iron and something organic Diego's mind refused to examine. Twice a day, he thought, though the thin grey light from the high window never changed enough to mark dawn from dusk with certainty. He counted meals instead. Seven. Or eight. Perhaps nine. The numbers slipped away from him like water through fingers, leaving only the thickness of isolation, the weight of silence broken only by distant sounds—footsteps in corridors, voices too muffled to parse into words, occasionally screaming that cut off abruptly in ways Diego's physician's mind understood but refused to fully acknowledge.

He had not been interrogated. No inquisitor had come. No questions asked. The waiting was its own persuasion, he understood—the slow erosion of certainty, the grinding pressure of solitude designed to make any human contact, even interrogation, seem preferable to continued isolation.

On the tenth meal—or perhaps the twelfth—the cell gate opened.

A guard stood in the corridor, his face as expressionless as the scribe's had been. "You have a visitor. Come."

Diego's body moved before his mind could process the words. He rose from the pallet where he had been lying—conserving warmth, conserving strength, the physician's practical knowledge applied to his own deterioration—and followed the guard down the corridor he had walked days ago, though now every step required conscious effort. His legs trembled. His bare feet registered the stone's cold with a sharpness that suggested fever, though whether from illness or simply from his body's slow surrender to this place, he could not determine.

They did not go to the interrogation chambers. The guard led him instead to a small room Diego had not seen before—barely larger than his cell, but furnished with a table and two stools and lit by a single candle whose flame seemed bright as noon sun after days of grey twilight.

"Sit," the guard said. "Do not speak until the visitor arrives. Do not touch. Do not approach closer than the table's width."

Diego sat. The stool was wood, worn smooth by countless bodies, and the simple act of sitting on something other than rotting straw felt almost luxurious. His hands found the table's edge and gripped it, needing the solidity, the confirmation that he still possessed a body capable of sensation beyond cold and hunger and the peculiar numbness that came from days without human voice or human touch.

The door opened.

Tomás de Mendoza stood in the threshold.

He had aged. That was Diego's first thought—irrational, impossible, it had been less than two weeks since the arrest. But Tomás's face had hollowed, his eyes sunk deep in sockets ringed with darkness, his hair gone grey at the temples in a way Diego's physician's training said was not possible over mere days but which his eyes insisted had occurred anyway. Grief did this sometimes. Or guilt.

Or both.

Tomás sat on the opposite stool. His hands shook as he placed them on the table, palm-down, fingers splayed as though trying to hold something in place that kept threatening to slip away. He did not meet Diego's eyes.

The guard stepped back but remained in the doorway, present and watching, ensuring no contraband passed between prisoner and visitor, no forbidden communication occurred beyond whatever script the Holy Office permitted or required.

"Diego." Tomás's voice cracked. "I—"

"Why are you here?" Diego's own voice emerged hoarse from disuse, rough as gravel, but steadier than he expected. The physician's calm asserting itself even now, even here, the performance continuing because performance was all he had left.

"I had to see you. I had to—" Tomás's breath hitched. His hands pressed harder against the table, knuckles whitening. "They have Rafael. They offered me... I couldn't let them... You understand, don't you?"

Understanding arrived with the force of physical blow. Diego felt it strike his chest, drive the air from his lungs, leave him gasping against a pain that had no wound to mark it. Not surprise—he had known, had suspected from the moment of arrest—but confirmation. The difference between suspecting betrayal and hearing it confessed.

"You testified," Diego said. Not a question.

"They had Rafael." Tomás's voice rose, defensive and pleading at once. "They said he would burn unless I gave them truth. They said families who protect each other through confession find mercy. They said—"

"What did you tell them?"

Tomás flinched. His eyes finally rose to meet Diego's, and in them Diego saw the full weight of what had been done. "The Friday candles. The fasting on certain days. The prayers your father taught us both in Hebrew. The..."

He continued, but Diego stopped hearing individual words. The list became a blur of specifics—intimate details, witnessed moments, shared secrets accumulated across twenty years of friendship and trust. Every Sabbath observed in whispered secret. Every holiday marked in the old way. Every prayer spoken in the language their grandparents had been forbidden to teach their children but had taught anyway, passing down memory like contraband, like inheritance, like the poison that would eventually kill them all.

Tomás knew everything. And Tomás had spoken everything. To inquisitors who wrote it all down with the same methodical care the scribe had employed recording Diego's genealogy, building the case that would justify whatever needed justifying—torture or death or the particular mercy of strangulation before burning granted to those who confessed fully and repented truly.

"—not supposed to arrest you," Tomás was saying. His words penetrated Diego's awareness in fragments. "They said if I testified, they would question you, give you chance to confess. Reconciliation, not—" His voice broke. "You understand, Diego. What would you have done? What choice did they give me?"

Diego's hands had begun to shake. He felt the tremor start in his fingers and spread up his arms, into his shoulders, into his chest where something hot and jagged was pushing upward toward his throat. Not quite hatred yet. Not quite. But close. So close.

"Rafael is your son," Diego said quietly. The words came from somewhere very far away, somewhere cold and clear and empty of everything except observation. "You chose your son."

"Yes." Tomás seized on this as though it were absolution. "Yes. What father wouldn't? What man could watch his child burn and not—"

"I taught Rafael to read." Diego's voice remained quiet, clinical, the physician noting symptoms without judgment. "When he was seven and the fever made him delirious, I sat by his bed for three nights. When Maria was born early and the midwife said she would not live, I kept her breathing until her lungs strengthened. Your children. Your family. Twenty years of Friday evenings at your table. Your father taught me the prayers you gave to the Inquisition. He held my father while my father died."

Each sentence fell between them like stones into still water, and Diego watched the ripples spread across Tomás's face—recognition, shame, the desperate need for Diego to say what Tomás needed to hear: *I understand. I forgive. You had no choice. I would have done the same.*

Diego said nothing.

"What would you have done?" Tomás's voice cracked completely now, dissolving into something raw and pleading. "Tell me, Diego. Your child or your friend? Which would you choose?"

The answer should have been obvious. The answer was obvious. Children came first. Blood came first. The choice was impossible and inevitable and human and understandable.

And Diego hated him anyway.

The hatred arrived fully formed, born complete like something that had been gestating in darkness and now emerged into light—not abstract principle or philosophical opposition but specific, visceral loathing for the man across the table. For Tomás's hollow face and shaking hands. For the justification Diego could see forming behind his eyes, the narrative taking shape: *I saved my son. Any man would have done the same. Diego will understand. Diego must understand.*

But understanding and forgiveness were not the same thing. And Diego, sitting in a cell he would likely die in, his body marked for breaking and his name already written in the ledgers of the condemned, understood perfectly and forgave nothing.

"You should not have come," Diego said.

"I needed you to know I didn't—I never meant—"

"You came for yourself." The observation emerged without heat, without emphasis, a diagnosis delivered to a patient who would not survive regardless of treatment. "You needed absolution. You needed me to tell you that you did the right thing. That the choice was impossible. That I do not hate you."

Tomás's face crumpled. "Do you? Hate me?"

Diego looked at his old friend—at the man who had taught him Hebrew prayers, who had sat shiva with his family, who had shared bread and salt and the secret observances that marked them as family in ways blood could not match. And he felt the hatred burning in his chest like live coal, hot and bright and almost comforting in its clarity.

"Yes," he said quietly. "I do."

Tomás made a sound—not quite a sob, not quite a gasp, something between grief and relief. As though Diego's honesty, brutal as it was, provided something closer to absolution than forgiveness could have offered. As though being hated cleanly was preferable to being forgiven falsely.

"I'm sorry," Tomás whispered.

"I know."

The guard stepped forward. "Time is finished."

Tomás rose on shaking legs. He looked at Diego as though wanting to say more, to offer something beyond apology, but the words did not come or could not come or had been exhausted along with everything else. He turned toward the door.

"Tomás."

He stopped.

"Rafael," Diego said. "Is he safe?"

Tomás's shoulders shook. He did not turn around. "Yes. They released him. He is home."

"Good."

The door closed. Tomás's footsteps faded down the corridor.

Diego sat alone in the small room with its single candle throwing shadows against stone walls. His hands rested on the table where Tomás's hands had rested moments before—palms down, fingers splayed, holding nothing. The trembling had stopped. The hatred remained, solid and heavy in his chest, a weight he could carry or set down but which existed now as simple fact rather than potential.

The guard returned to lead him back to his cell. Diego followed without resistance, his body moving through the familiar corridors while his mind circled the hatred the way a tongue circles a broken tooth—testing its edges, measuring its depth, confirming its presence.

Tomás had betrayed him. The betrayal was understandable. The betrayal was unforgivable. Both truths existed together, contradiction and paradox, and Diego—physician, healer, man who had spent his life trying to mend what was broken—could not reconcile them, could only acknowledge that hatred had taken root in soil prepared by forty-three years of suppressed rage and exhausted performance, and now grew with the vigor of something that had finally found proper conditions for its flourishing.

The cell gate closed behind him. The lock turned.

Diego lay on the straw pallet in grey light and felt the hatred pulse in his chest with each heartbeat—steady, persistent, alive in ways the rest of him had begun to feel hollow. The physician who had examined symptoms in others now examined this new symptom in himself, cataloguing its presence with clinical precision even as some other part of him—some part that remembered who he had been before the knock, before the arrest, before the world inverted—whispered that the hatred would poison him more surely than any torture the Inquisition could devise.

But poison or not, it was his. The only thing in this place that belonged to him alone, that the Holy Office could not take, could not record, could not reduce to entries in a ledger.

His hatred. Specific and personal and burning bright enough to warm him in the cold cell's darkness.

He closed his eyes and let it burn.

# Scene 6: The Interrogation

---

They came for him after the evening meal—or what Diego had learned to recognize as evening by the pattern of sounds beyond his cell, the shift in the thin light, the rhythm of the prison settling into night's particular silence. Two guards, neither speaking, leading him through corridors he had not seen before, deeper into the prison's heart where the air grew thicker and the walls wept moisture that caught torchlight and gleamed like something organic.

The interrogation chamber was larger than Diego expected and smaller than his dread had imagined. A table stood at the room's center, lit by candles arranged in a careful circle—too many candles, their combined light bright and shadowless and somehow more terrible than darkness would have been. Behind the table sat three men in the black robes of the Holy Office, their faces half-hidden by hoods drawn forward, their hands folded with the stillness of those accustomed to waiting.

A small desk stood to one side, and at it sat a scribe—perhaps the same scribe who had processed Diego's arrival, though the distance and candlelight made certainty impossible. His quill was already poised, ready to record whatever emerged from the questions that would follow.

And in the corner, almost invisible in the shadows the candles could not quite banish, stood a figure in grey.

Diego's breath caught. His body recognized her before his mind could process why—some animal awareness deeper than thought, older than reason, the instinct that made prey freeze when predators drew near.

Sor Catalina.

She stood motionless, her hands folded at her waist, her veil drawn forward to shadow her face. But Diego could see her eyes—watchful, patient, fixed on him with the same intensity he had felt outside San Bartolomé, the same weight of attention that had followed him through dreams and waking both.

"Diego de Lucena." The central inquisitor's voice was gentle, almost kind, the tone a physician might use with a frightened child. "Please. Sit."

A stool had been placed before the table. Diego's legs carried him forward, his body performing obedience while his mind catalogued details with the physician's trained observation: the inquisitors' careful positioning, the scribe's ready quill, the woman in the corner whose presence made his skin prickle with cold that had nothing to do with the chamber's temperature.

He sat.

"We know everything, Diego." The inquisitor leaned forward slightly, candlelight catching the deep lines around his mouth. "The witnesses have spoken. Their testimony has been examined and verified. What remains is your confession—not to inform us of your sins, which are already known, but to cleanse your soul through acknowledgment. Do you understand?"

The trap was perfect. Confession meant admitting guilt. Denial meant disputing testimony already deemed credible. Silence meant obstinacy that would require stronger persuasion. Every path led to the same destination—only the route varied, and the suffering along the way.

"I understand," Diego said.

"Good." The inquisitor nodded, satisfied. "Then let us begin. Did you light candles on Friday evenings?"

Diego's hands found each other in his lap, fingers touching in sequence—index, middle, ring, smallest. The gesture was automatic, seeking steadiness that would not come, control that had already been stripped away along with everything else.

"I lit candles," he said carefully. "For light. As any household—"

"Two candles. Lit as the sun set. Placed in the window according to the old rite." The inquisitor's voice remained gentle, but something beneath the gentleness had gone hard. "Do not insult God's servants with evasion, Diego. We seek truth, not wordplay."

How did they know? The question rose and died unspoken. Tomás knew. Tomás had testified. The two candles in the window, the prayers spoken in whisper, the Friday meal that marked time according to a calendar the Holy Office had declared heretical—all of it documented now, recorded, transformed into evidence that could not be disputed because disputing it meant calling the witnesses liars, and the witnesses had already been deemed reliable.

"I lit candles on Friday," Diego admitted.

The scribe's quill scratched. Recording. Preserving. Creating the permanent account that would justify whatever came next.

"And did you abstain from pork?"

"Sometimes. For... medical reasons. The meat was often spoiled in summer—"

"Did you fast on certain days? Days that happened to coincide with Jewish holy days despite your professed Christian faith?"

Diego's throat had gone dry. The questions came faster now, each one building on the last, constructing a framework of guilt that grew more solid with every answer. Yes, he had fasted. Yes, on days that might have been Yom Kippur if anyone were observing such things, which he was not, which his family was not, except that they were and everyone knew it and the pretense had been exactly that—pretense, performance, the lie he had lived so long he had almost convinced himself it was truth.

"Did you speak Hebrew prayers at your father's deathbed?"

Something in Diego broke. Not his composure—that remained intact, the physician's calm still functioning despite everything. What broke was deeper, harder to name. The last hope that this was mistake, misunderstanding, something that could be corrected through proper explanation.

They knew everything. Every private moment. Every secret observance. Every prayer spoken in darkness when the world should not have been watching. But the world was always watching, and Tomás had watched alongside him, had spoken the same prayers, had performed the same rites, and then had carried every detail to the Holy Office like tribute, like payment, like the price of his son's freedom purchased with his friend's blood.

"Yes," Diego whispered.

The quill scratched. The candles burned without flickering, their light steady and pitiless.

The inquisitor sat back, his expression unreadable behind the hood's shadow. "You see how easy truth is? How simple confession becomes when we stop clinging to deception?" He folded his hands on the table, a gesture that might have been prayer or satisfaction. "But we are not finished, Diego. Confession must be complete. Partial truth is no truth at all. Tell us—who shared these practices with you? What other families observed the old rites? Who else must be brought to understanding so their souls might be saved?"

And there it was. The true purpose beneath the questioning. Diego was not the goal—he was the means. The Holy Office wanted names. Wanted the network mapped, the connections documented, the whole community of secret observers exposed so the purification could be thorough, complete, absolute.

"I observed alone," Diego said.

The inquisitor's expression did not change, but something in his stillness sharpened. "Alone? A man does not learn Hebrew prayers alone. A man does not maintain Jewish holy days alone. Someone taught you. Someone shared these practices. Give us their names, Diego. Confession cleanses—but only complete confession. Protecting heretics damns your soul as surely as heresy itself."

Diego's gaze drifted past the inquisitors to the corner where Sor Catalina stood. She had not moved. Had not spoken. But her eyes—those strange eyes with their pale crescent that caught candlelight and seemed to glow with illumination that came from within rather than without—remained fixed on him with an intensity that made breathing difficult.

Why was she here? The question circled his mind like a bird seeking purchase. Beatas did not attend interrogations. Holy women counseled the distressed, prayed for the condemned, offered spiritual comfort—but they did not stand in corners watching men be broken question by question toward confession.

Unless. Unless she was not here for him. Unless she was here to learn. To witness. To carry back to others in the converso community the lesson of what happened to those who resisted, who protected their fellows, who chose solidarity over survival.

Or unless—and this thought arrived with a cold that spread through Diego's chest like winter—she was here because she had helped arrange this. Had counseled Tomás toward testimony. Had guided the Holy Office toward questions that would trap. Had stood in this corner before, watching other men crumble, and would stand here again when Diego's turn was done.

"I will ask again." The inquisitor's voice lost its gentleness. "Who shared these practices? Your wife? Your neighbors? The merchant Tomás de Mendoza, who has already confessed his own sins and seeks now to aid others toward truth?"

Tomás had given them Diego. But not, apparently, others. Or perhaps he had given partial names, partial testimony, and the Holy Office wanted confirmation, wanted the network fully mapped before moving against it.

"My wife observed Christian practices," Diego said. Each word emerged slow, careful, the physician treating speech as delicate work requiring precision. "She attended Mass. She kept the feasts. She is innocent of any—"

"That is not what we asked." The inquisitor stood. The movement was sudden enough to make Diego flinch, his body betraying the fear his voice still managed to control. "We asked who else maintained the Jewish rites. Who else must be brought to confession. Answer truthfully, Diego, or we will be forced to employ methods more rigorous than gentle questioning."

There it was. The threat made explicit. Torture. The strappado that would dislocate his shoulders. The toca that would fill his lungs with water until drowning seemed imminent and preferable to continuation. The potro that would stretch his joints until cartilage tore and bones separated and his healer's hands—the hands that had set fractures and sutured wounds—would be rendered useless, broken, transformed into evidence of the Holy Office's patient dedication to extracting truth regardless of cost.

Diego's hands found each other, fingers pressing together in sequence. The ritual that steadied. The gesture that controlled. Index, middle, ring, smallest. Again. Again.

In the corner, Sor Catalina watched. Her expression remained neutral, pious, as though she observed a religious rite rather than a man being dismantled question by question toward breaking. But something in her eyes—some quality Diego could not name but felt like pressure against his chest—suggested satisfaction. Or anticipation.

"I do not know others who practiced," Diego said quietly. "I maintained the rites my father taught me. What others did in their own houses, I cannot speak to."

It was the truth. A careful truth, shaped and limited, but truth nonetheless. He suspected many families in the Quarter maintained secret observances. Everyone suspected. But suspicion was not knowledge, and knowledge was what the Holy Office demanded.

The inquisitor studied him in silence. The candles burned. The scribe's quill remained poised but did not move—nothing to record without confession.

"You are protecting them," the inquisitor said finally. "You choose to protect heretics over your own soul's salvation." He gestured to the guards waiting by the door. "Perhaps deeper reflection will clarify your memory. We will speak again, Diego de Lucena. When you are ready to embrace truth completely."

The guards moved forward. The interview was over—for now. Diego rose on shaking legs, his body exhausted by the effort of maintaining control through questioning that had felt like surgery performed without knife or blood but cutting nonetheless.

As the guards led him toward the door, he passed close to Sor Catalina's corner. Close enough to see her face clearly beneath the veil's shadow. Close enough to meet her eyes directly.

She smiled.

It was the same smile she had worn outside San Bartolomé—gentle, terrible, empty of everything except a knowing that transcended the interrogation chamber, transcended this moment, transcended everything Diego understood about the world and his place in it. As though she could see futures he could not imagine, as though his suffering were already written and she merely watched it unfold according to plan.

Diego wanted to speak. Wanted to ask why. Wanted to demand what right she had to stand in corners watching men be broken for sins they had committed only in the privacy of their own hearts and homes.

But the guards were pulling him forward, and speech was forbidden, and she was already turning away—dissolving back into shadow as though she had never been solid, as though her presence were vision or dream or something that existed in the spaces between real and imagined.

The door closed behind him. The corridor's cold wrapped around him like familiar darkness.

They did not return him to his cell. Instead they led him down stairs that descended into depths where even the torches seemed reluctant to burn, where the air grew thick with the smell of old blood and sweat and fear so concentrated it had seeped into the stones themselves.

The guards stopped before a door reinforced with iron straps.

"Tomorrow," one of them said—the first words either had spoken. "Tomorrow you will have opportunity to remember what you claimed to have forgotten. The Holy Office is patient. But patience has limits."

They opened the door onto darkness deeper than his cell had ever known, onto silence broken only by distant sounds Diego's physician's training allowed him to recognize and his humanity begged him to deny.

He stepped inside. The door closed. The darkness became absolute.

Diego stood in perfect black, his hands finding each other by touch alone, fingers pressing together in sequence—index, middle, ring, smallest—while somewhere above him Sor Catalina walked Toledo's streets and smiled at those who sought her counsel, and tomorrow the questioning would resume and continue and deepen until confession came or death provided mercy the Holy Office would not grant while his body still held secrets they believed could be extracted.

His hands would not steady.

In the darkness, hatred pulsed beneath his breastbone—for the inquisitors who believed their cruelty holy, for the system that consumed the innocent, for Tomás who had spoken every secret, and for the woman in grey whose eyes watched with an attention that exceeded human interest and approached something older, colder, patient as stone waiting for weather to wear it down to nothing.

The hatred kept him warm in the absolute dark. The only thing in this place that belonged to him alone.

He held it close and waited for tomorrow's suffering to begin.

# Scene 7: The Healer's Burden

---

The guard came three days after the interrogation—or what Diego believed was three days, time having dissolved into cycles of meals and darkness and waiting for pain that had not yet come but whose promise hung over every waking moment like storm clouds that refused to break.

"Physician." The guard's voice carried neither sympathy nor cruelty, only the flat utility of someone delivering information. "Your services are required."

Diego rose from the pallet where he had been lying in half-sleep, the state between waking and dreaming that had become his default condition. His legs trembled as weight settled onto them—not from torture, which had not yet been applied, but from disuse and the slow starvation of prison rations. His hands found the cell's wall for balance, stone cold and damp beneath his palms.

"Required where?" His voice emerged hoarse.

"You will see."

They led him through corridors grown familiar in their wrongness, past cells where other prisoners lay or sat or stood pressed against grates watching his passage with eyes that held every stage of suffering—fresh terror, grinding endurance, empty surrender. The prison was a catalog of dissolution, bodies at various points along the path from person to confession to whatever lay beyond confession when the Holy Office had extracted everything extract-able and the remnant was released to secular authorities for final disposition.

The guard stopped before a cell three corridors from Diego's own. Through the grate, Diego could see a shape on the floor—a man, though gender was nearly indeterminate beneath the filth and damage. The shape moved shallowly, breath coming in hitches that Diego's physician's ear recognized immediately: broken ribs, possibly punctured lung, airway partially obstructed.

"This one was examined yesterday," the guard said. The euphemism was unnecessary—examined meant tortured, everyone understood this, the language of bureaucracy performing its sanitizing function. "He requires attention before further questioning can proceed. You will provide such attention."

The cell gate opened. The guard gestured Diego inside.

The man on the floor could not have been more than thirty, though suffering had aged him past easy estimation. His shoulders sat at wrong angles—both dislocated, Diego diagnosed instantly, the strappado's signature damage. His wrists bore the deep purple-black of rope burns where he had hung from his own weight. Blood crusted his nose and mouth, suggesting either impact trauma or the beginning stages of drowning from the toca before they had pulled him back from the edge.

Diego knelt beside him. The physician's instinct took over despite everything—despite being a prisoner himself, despite knowing what he was being asked to do, despite the bitter irony of healing a man so the Holy Office could hurt him again. His hands moved over the broken body with practiced care, assessing damage with the same methodical precision he had brought to every patient in his consultation room.

"Water," Diego said without looking at the guard. "Clean cloth if you have it. Salve for the burns."

The guard left. Returned minutes later with a bucket of water that smelled only slightly foul and a rag that might once have been white. No salve. Diego had not truly expected any.

He wet the cloth and began cleaning the man's face, working around swelling and contusions to clear crusted blood from nose and mouth. The man's breathing eased slightly—a small improvement, but improvement nonetheless. Airway clearing. Basic care. The foundation upon which all healing built.

"Thank you," the man whispered. His voice was barely audible, each word clearly painful, but carried genuine gratitude that struck Diego's chest like a blow.

Thank you. For this. For cleaning his face while his shoulders hung dislocated and his ribs ground against punctured lung tissue and his wrists wept clear fluid that suggested infection brewing beneath the burns.

Diego's hands paused. He stared at the cloth in his grip—bloodstained now, filthy with the evidence of the Holy Office's patient work. What was he doing? What was he providing here except the means for this suffering to continue? If he left the shoulders dislocated, if he allowed infection to spread, if he did nothing at all, this man would die. Not peacefully—infection deaths were ugly, painful, prolonged—but die nonetheless, and dying would end his suffering where healing would only extend it.

"The shoulders," the man whispered. "Please. I cannot... the pain..."

He could refuse. Diego realized this with sudden clarity. Could tell the guard he lacked materials, lacked knowledge, lacked whatever excuse seemed plausible. The Holy Office might torture him for refusing—but they would torture him anyway, eventually. Interrogations did not end with a single session. The machinery had its own momentum, its own requirements. His cooperation or resistance in this moment would change nothing except whether this one man's shoulders remained dislocated or not.

Except. Except the man was asking. Thanking him. Looking at Diego's hands as though they represented mercy in a place where mercy had been systematically excised from all interactions.

Diego's hands moved before his mind finished deliberating. Training deeper than thought. The physician's reflex older than this prison, older than the Inquisition, older than every rational reason to let broken things stay broken.

He positioned himself at the man's side. "This will hurt," he said quietly. "I am sorry."

The man nodded understanding.

Diego gripped the man's right arm, found the proper angle, and pulled while rotating in the motion he had performed hundreds of times for dislocated joints. The shoulder resisted—swelling made the manipulation harder, muscles had contracted around the injury—but Diego applied steady pressure until the humeral head found its socket with a sound like wet wood cracking.

The man screamed. Brief and sharp, cut off by breath-hitching pain, then subsiding into panting silence.

One shoulder. Diego repeated the procedure on the left. Another scream. Another moment of agony Diego had chosen to inflict in service of healing that was not healing at all but merely making this body functional enough to survive more breaking.

"Thank you," the man gasped when he could speak again. "God bless you. Thank you."

The gratitude was real. The blessing sincere. The man's pain had lessened—shoulders in proper alignment hurt less than shoulders wrenched from sockets, this was simple anatomical fact. Diego had helped. Had healed. Had done his physician's duty.

And had thereby ensured that tomorrow, or the next day, or whenever the inquisitors decided further questioning was necessary, this man would be strong enough to endure more examination. More persuasion. More machinery applied to flesh until confession came or death intervened.

The guard appeared at the cell gate. "Finished?"

Diego looked down at the man on the floor. Color had returned slightly to his face. Breathing came easier. The shoulders sat in proper alignment, and though the damage would take weeks to heal fully, immediate crisis had been averted.

Crisis. The word was obscene. As though avoiding death in a cell where death would come regardless constituted meaningful improvement.

"Yes," Diego said.

They returned him to his own cell. The gate closed. The lock turned.

Diego stood in grey light, his hands hanging at his sides, and saw them as though for the first time—these hands that had spent forty-three years learning to mend what was broken, to heal what was wounded, to preserve life against suffering and death. Useful hands. Skilled hands. The physician's instruments.

Now instruments of the Holy Office's patience. Tools that extended suffering by preventing early death. The means by which examination could continue, persuasion could deepen, the machinery could grind forward without the inefficiency of prisoners dying before confession was complete.

He had believed usefulness would protect him. Had spent his life cultivating skill because skill meant value, and value meant survival. But usefulness had no loyalty. His healing served whatever master required it—the merchant with gout, the priest's sister with inflammation, or the inquisitors who needed prisoners functional enough to break properly.

The gratitude haunted him more than the breaking. The man had thanked him. Had blessed him. Had looked at Diego's work as though it were kindness rather than complicity, as though resetting dislocated shoulders in a torture chamber were medicine rather than collaboration with the machinery designed to extract confession through the systematic application of pain.

Diego sat on his pallet. The straw crunched beneath his weight, releasing smells he had stopped noticing through constant exposure. His hands rested in his lap—steady now, competent, the physician's hands that knew their work and did it well regardless of context.

He hated them. Hated the training that made them move before thought could intervene. Hated the skill that made them useful to those who would use them. Hated the bargain he had made—unknowing, unspoken, but binding nonetheless—that his value to the world depended on his willingness to heal without regard to what that healing enabled.

The hatred that had burned for Tomás, that had extended to the inquisitors and the woman in grey who watched with eyes too knowing for comfort, now turned inward. Self-hatred joined the other hatreds, took root in soil prepared by every patient he had treated believing that service would purchase safety, that usefulness would armor him against a world that wanted his blood regardless of his skill.

He had been wrong. About everything. About the bargain's terms. About safety's price. About whether healing was virtue or simply another form of violence wearing mercy's mask.

His hands touched together in sequence—index, middle, ring, smallest. The gesture that steadied. The physician's ritual.

They did not steady. They shook with exhaustion and hatred and the recognition that he could not refuse to heal anymore than he could refuse to breathe, that the compulsion was woven too deep to extract without destroying whatever remained of who he had been before the knock, before the arrest, before the world inverted and revealed the truth beneath every careful performance: he was meat, and his meat's particular skills were useful, and usefulness was obligation rather than protection.

Somewhere in the prison's depths, the man with reset shoulders breathed easier and waited for tomorrow's examination. Grateful. Blessed. Alive because Diego's hands had moved and done what they were trained to do.

Diego closed his eyes and felt the hatred pulse beneath his breastbone—for Tomás who had betrayed, for inquisitors who questioned, for the woman who watched, for the Holy Office that consumed, and now for himself. For his own hands. For the healer who could not help but heal even when healing was the cruelest thing he could have done.

The only honest response to this place was hatred. The only recognition of what was being done to him, and what he was being made to do, was rage at all of it—the machinery and those who ran it and those who fed it and himself for being made instrument rather than person, tool rather than human, useful rather than free.

The hatred kept him warm. The only warmth in the cold cell.

He held it close and waited for the next summons, the next broken body, the next opportunity to provide the Holy Office with exactly what they needed from the physician whose skill had never protected him but would, before this ended, be used to protect the Inquisition's investment in prisoners whose confessions had not yet been extracted and whose bodies required maintenance before they could be properly broken toward truth.

# Scene 8: The Release

---

Night came, though in the cell night and day were distinguished only by subtle shifts in the grey light that seeped through the high window—darker grey, lighter grey, the prison's own twilight that never truly lifted or settled but simply existed as permanent condition. Diego lay on the straw pallet, his body too exhausted to sleep, his mind too active to rest. The hatred pulsed beneath his breastbone with each heartbeat—steady, persistent, almost comforting in its constancy.

He examined it the way he would examine a wound. What was it made of? Where had it taken root? The physician's diagnostic approach applied to the condition of his own interior state, as though cataloging symptoms might reveal treatment or at least understanding.

Tomás's face appeared first. The hollow eyes. The shaking hands. The desperate need for absolution Diego had refused to give. The hatred for Tomás was specific, personal—rage at a man who had chosen his son over his friend, who had carried twenty years of shared secrets to the Holy Office like tithe, who watched from his window while Diego walked to imprisonment bought with testimony that could not be retracted or forgiven.

But the hatred did not stop with Tomás.

The inquisitors with their gentle voices and patient questions. The scribe whose quill transformed lives into evidence. The guards who performed their duty with mechanical precision. The woman in grey who watched from corners with eyes that seemed to see past the surface of things to some truth Diego could not name but felt like weight pressing against his chest. The Holy Office entire—the machinery that consumed the innocent and guilty alike, that made no distinction between devotion and performance because performance was always suspect and devotion could never be proven.

And himself. The physician who could not stop healing. The useful man who had believed usefulness would protect him. The performer who had lived forty-three years in careful safety purchased with constant vigilance, only to discover that vigilance purchased nothing and safety was illusion and the bargain had never existed except in his own desperate need to believe competence might armor flesh against the world's cruelty.

The hatred encompassed all of it. Burned bright and hot in his chest, warming the cold cell, giving him something to hold when everything else had been stripped away. His only possession. His only certainty in a place where certainty dissolved under questioning and truth became whatever the inquisitors needed it to be.

He could carry this hatred to his death. The thought arrived clearly, without particular emotion. He could hold it close, nurse it, let it burn in his chest until the fire consumed him literally and the hatred became one with the flames. The inquisitors would burn his body, but they could not burn the rage he carried—that would remain his, inviolate, the one thing they could not extract through questioning or persuasion or machinery designed to make flesh confess what mind refused.

Except. Except.

The hatred burned, yes. Warmed him, yes. But what did it illuminate?

Diego's physician's mind turned the question over with the same care he had used examining the hatred's roots. What did this rage show him? What did it reveal?

Tomás had betrayed him. This was fact. But Tomás had also been given an impossible choice—his son's life purchased with his friend's freedom. What father would choose differently? What man could watch his child burn and not pay whatever price was demanded? The choice was understandable. Human. The kind of terrible calculus the Holy Office specialized in creating—moral dilemmas with no clean answers, situations where any choice carried guilt.

Understanding did not make it forgivable. Diego tested this recognition, probed it for weakness. No. He understood Tomás's choice completely and forgave nothing. But understanding and forgiveness were not the same thing, and hatred and understanding could exist together without canceling each other.

The inquisitors. They believed their work holy. Genuinely believed it—Diego had seen the conviction in their questions, the certainty that extracting confession served God's purpose and saved souls even when it destroyed bodies. They were not demons. They were men who had been given authority and convinced that authority served righteousness, who never questioned whether their certainty might be mistaken because questioning would undermine the foundation upon which the entire machinery rested.

Hating them was easy. Understanding them was harder. But understanding them—seeing how ordinary men became instruments of systematic cruelty through conviction they were serving good—did not require forgiving them. Did not require releasing the rage their questions provoked.

Unless.

The thought arrived quietly, almost hesitantly, like a patient presenting symptoms they were not certain merited the physician's attention.

Unless the hatred hurt Diego more than it hurt those he hated.

He sat up on the pallet, the movement sudden enough to make his head swim. The cell spun briefly before settling into familiar stone walls and grey light and the bucket whose smell he had stopped noticing through constant exposure.

Tomás would live with what he had done. Would wake every morning to Diego's face in memory. Would carry the weight of betrayal for whatever years the Holy Office granted him before finding some other reason to consume him. Diego's hatred added nothing to that burden. Changed nothing. Tomás's guilt was his own, and whether Diego hated him or not made no difference to the calculus of his suffering.

The inquisitors would continue their work. Would question and examine and extract confessions from other prisoners with the same patient dedication they brought to Diego's case. His hatred of them changed nothing. They would not know he hated them. Would not care if they did. The machinery ground forward independent of its subjects' feelings toward it.

And himself. The self-hatred for hands that healed when healing served evil, for skills that made him useful, for the bargain he had never made but had spent his life believing in—that hatred poisoned nothing except himself. Made no one else suffer. Changed no external circumstance.

The hatred existed only in his own chest. Burned only in his own interior country. Hurt only him.

This recognition settled in Diego's mind with the clarity of diagnosis after long examination. The hatred was real. The reasons for it valid. But carrying it forward accomplished nothing except ensuring that the Holy Office's work continued inside him after his body burned, that Tomás's betrayal kept betraying him through his own refusal to set down what Tomás had handed him, that he remained prisoner to rage even if—when—they released his body to secular authorities for final disposition.

He could choose to carry it. Or he could choose to set it down.

Not forgiveness. The distinction mattered. Forgiveness implied reconciliation, implied making right what had been done wrong, implied some restoration of relationship or trust. Diego could not forgive Tomás. Could not forgive the inquisitors. Could not forgive the Holy Office or the woman in grey or any of it.

But he could release them. Could open the fist clenched around the burning coal of hatred and let it fall. Not because they deserved release. Not because the wrongs they had done were acceptable or understandable or anything except what they were—cruelty, betrayal, systematic destruction of human beings in service of ideology that claimed righteousness.

But because carrying the coal burned only his own hand. And burning accomplished nothing except ensuring his suffering continued independent of theirs, that he remained bound to them through hatred long after death severed all other connections.

Diego touched his fingers together in sequence. Index. Middle. Ring. Smallest. The physician's ritual. The gesture that steadied.

His hands trembled, but less than before.

The hatred remained. He could feel it in his chest—solid, hot, real as any wound he had ever treated. But he was no longer identical with it. Some space had opened between the Diego who felt rage and the Diego who observed the rage, between the emotion and the one experiencing the emotion.

He could let it go.

Not all at once. Not completely. Hatred accumulated over forty-three years of suppression and performance and exhausted vigilance could not be released in a single moment of recognition. But the fist could begin to open. The grip could loosen. The coal could be acknowledged as burning without being held.

Tomás had chosen his son. The choice was understandable and unforgivable both. Diego released him to live with it.

The inquisitors believed their cruelty holy. The belief was genuine and monstrous both. Diego released them to their certainty.

The Holy Office ground forward, consuming the innocent. The machinery existed independent of Diego's rage toward it. He released it to continue without his hatred fueling its fires from within his own chest.

And himself. The physician who healed because he was physician, whose skill was deeper than choice, whose usefulness had never protected him but was, nevertheless, what he was. He released the hatred of his own hands. They were simply hands. They had done what they were trained to do. The evil was in the use others made of them, not in the hands themselves.

The woman in grey. Her watching eyes. Her presence in corners. The wrongness he felt when she was near. Something about her remained unresolved—some recognition his body held that his mind could not grasp. But hating her accomplished nothing. He released her to whatever purpose brought her to interrogation chambers and Toledo streets. She was not his burden to carry.

Something loosened in Diego's chest. Not the hatred disappearing—it remained, would likely always remain, the scar tissue of these weeks that no healing could fully mend. But it was no longer him. He had stepped back from it. Become the one who observed the hatred rather than the one consumed by it.

The coal fell from his hand. He watched it fall. Felt the burning ease.

Outside the cell, the prison continued its machinery. Prisoners suffered. Inquisitors questioned. Scribes recorded. The Holy Office pursued its holy work of purification through destruction, and Diego's release of hatred changed none of it.

But it changed him.

He lay back on the pallet, his body settling into straw that crunched and released familiar smells. His hands rested at his sides—steady now, or steady enough. The physician's hands that had never protected him but which he no longer hated for failing to accomplish what hands alone could never achieve.

Through the high window, stars were visible—countless and cold, the same stars that had looked down on his grandfather's grandfather, on generations who had hidden their prayers and performed their faith and died anyway because the world did not care about performance or devotion or usefulness, only about blood and who had permission to shed it.

He had released them. Tomás and the inquisitors and the machinery and his own hands and the woman whose eyes watched from corners. Released them all to whatever waited—for them, for him, for the days between now and the fire he knew was coming.

The hatred remained. But he was free of it.

Free to die without rage poisoning the final moments. Free to face whatever came next without carrying the burden forward into new flesh, new life, new chances to learn what this life had finally taught him:

That hatred was a choice. That persecution could destroy the body but could not poison the soul unless the victim drank the poison himself. That release was possible even when forgiveness was not. That setting down the burning coal did not mean accepting what had been done, only refusing to let it continue doing itself inside him long after the external cruelty ended.

Diego closed his eyes. Exhaustion claimed him—not the grinding wakefulness of recent days but something deeper, more restful, the first true sleep since the knock had split his old life from this new truth.

He slept without dreams. Without hatred's heat keeping him wakeful.

Free, in the only way freedom remained possible in this place where every other freedom had been stripped away.

Free to die peacefully. To burn without rage. To carry forward nothing except the question that was already forming in the space where hatred had lived:

If he could release this—the deepest, most justified rage he had ever known—what else might be released? What else was he carrying that did not need to be carried? What other certainties might be questioned, examined, set down when they proved to be burdens rather than truths?

The question would wait. Would carry forward. Would seed what came next, in whatever body the flame found after this one burned.

For now, Diego slept. Released. Ready.

The stars turned overhead, cold and countless, and bore witness to nothing except their own continuation.

# Scene 9: The Fire

---

They came for him at dawn.

No warning, no summons, but Diego had known. The pattern was clear enough—prisoners who did not confess fully were processed through interrogation, through examination of increasing rigor, and finally through to reconciliation or relaxation to secular authorities. Diego had provided partial confession but refused to name others. The Holy Office's patience, infinite in theory, had limits in practice. The auto-de-fé had been scheduled. His name was on the list.

The guards dressed him in the sanbenito—a yellow tunic painted with flames and demons, the visual catalog of his crimes worn as public declaration. The fabric was coarse against skin gone sensitive from weeks in the cell's darkness. They placed the coroza on his head, a pointed cap that made him a figure of mockery and warning both. His crimes were written there too, in letters large enough to be read from distance: *Heretic. Judaizer. Relapsed.*

Relapsed. The word was technically inaccurate—he had never publicly recanted to relapse from—but accuracy was not the auto-de-fé's purpose. The spectacle required villains, and villains required costuming.

They led him into morning light that struck his eyes like blades after weeks of grey twilight. Toledo's plaza stretched before him, already crowded with citizens who had come to witness God's justice made visible. Merchants. Nobles. Peasants. Families with children perched on shoulders to see better. The auto-de-fé was entertainment and education both—the state's power demonstrated, the Church's authority confirmed, the cost of heresy made manifest in flesh and fire.

Seven stakes had been erected in the plaza's center. Seven condemned. Diego was not alone.

They processed the prisoners in order, reading crimes and sentences with bureaucratic precision. A woman who had kept Jewish dietary laws. A man who had questioned transubstantiation. An old merchant accused of Islamic sympathies. Each name, each crime, each sentence recorded and proclaimed so all would know that the Holy Office's work was thorough, documented, justified by testimony and confession extracted through proper channels.

"Diego de Lucena, physician, convicted of heresy and judaizing practices." The official's voice carried across the plaza, flat and formal. "Having confessed to lighting Sabbath candles, observing Jewish fasts, and speaking Hebrew prayers, but having refused to name accomplices or demonstrate complete repentance, is hereby relaxed to secular authorities for final disposition."

Relaxed. Another euphemism. The Church did not execute—it merely handed condemned prisoners to secular courts who carried out sentences the Church determined but took no responsibility for. The language performed its function, creating distance between holy purpose and profane violence, allowing the inquisitors to burn heretics while maintaining that they shed no blood.

They bound Diego to his stake. The rope cut into his wrists and chest, holding him upright against wood that had been used before—he could smell the char, the residue of previous burnings that stained the timber black in places. Around his feet they piled dry wood and straw, building the pyre with practiced efficiency. Not green wood that would create smoke for slow suffocation. Dry wood that would catch quickly and burn hot. No mercy of strangulation before the flames—that was granted only to those who confessed fully and repented truly. Diego would burn alive.

He felt no fear. The absence startled him for a moment—his physician's mind noting the symptom, diagnosing shock or acceptance or the peculiar peace that sometimes came to the dying when resistance became pointless. But it was not shock. It was the space that had opened in his chest when he released the hatred, the gap between emotion and self that allowed him to observe what was happening without being consumed by it before the flames even caught.

A face in the crowd drew his attention. Tomás de Mendoza stood among the citizens, Rafael beside him. Both wore expressions of carefully maintained neutrality—not celebration, which would seem cruel, but not grief, which might suggest sympathy with the condemned. The correct performance for those who had cooperated with the Holy Office and thereby earned continued safety.

Diego looked at Tomás and felt the hatred's echo—still there, would always be there, but distant now. Observed rather than experienced. He had released Tomás to live with what he had done, and Tomás would live with it. That was enough. More than enough.

Another face appeared at the crowd's edge. The woman in grey. Sor Catalina, her veil drawn forward, her expression grave and pious as she watched the proceedings. Come to pray for the condemned, perhaps. Or to witness the fruit of her counsel, the natural conclusion of testimony she had encouraged through her guidance of Tomás and others whose distress she had eased by directing them toward confession.

She stood very still, her hands folded, her eyes fixed on Diego with that same watching intensity that had troubled him since their first meeting. He did not understand her. Did not know what she was or why her presence made his body respond with dread his mind could not explain. But he released her too. Whatever she was, whatever purpose she served, it was not his burden to carry into death.

A priest approached to hear final confession, offer final rites. Diego accepted the blessing mechanically. Spoke words of repentance that were expected, though whether he meant them or simply performed them one last time, he could not say and did not care. The forms mattered to those watching. To Diego they were simply sounds, ritual that marked the transition from life to death the way his physician's examinations had marked transitions from health to illness.

The priest stepped back. The official nodded to the guards.

They brought the torches.

Heat before pain. Diego felt warmth against his legs first, the straw catching with a sound like breathing, flames rising through dry wood that had been stacked to channel air and maximize burning. Smoke rose—not the thick black smoke of green wood but thin grey that carried the smell of char and something sweetish Diego's physician's mind identified distantly as his own flesh beginning to burn.

The sanbenito caught first. Yellow fabric blackening at its hem, flames crawling upward with patient hunger. Diego watched the fire climb toward his chest and felt... observation. The physician noting symptoms. Temperature increasing. Skin blistering. Pain beginning to register—sharp at first, then overwhelming as nerve endings fired their final messages before heat destroyed them entirely.

His flesh was meat. The recognition arrived with absolute clarity. This body that had healed others, that had carried him through forty-three years of careful performance and usefulness and the exhausting vigilance of converso life—it was meat. Fuel for flames. Organic matter returning to ash and smoke and the elements from which it had been assembled.

The Holy Office could burn this meat. Could reduce it to cinders. Could destroy the physician's careful hands and the body they had never managed to protect.

But they could not make him drink the poison.

The thought arrived through pain that was becoming absolute, that was dissolving his ability to think in anything except fragments. They could burn the flesh. Could not poison the soul. He had released the hatred. Had set down the burning coal before it could burn him from within. Whatever died in these flames, it would die free of the rage that might have kept him bound to this suffering long after the meat stopped burning.

Pain was becoming everything. Diego's vision narrowed, darkened at the edges. Smoke and heat and agony that transcended his physician's ability to categorize or diagnose. He was dying. The process was unmistakable. Irreversible. Final.

And in the spaces between pain, in the moments when consciousness flickered like the flames consuming his legs, a question formed.

Not about hatred. Not about Tomás or the inquisitors or the machinery that had consumed him. The hatred was released. That lesson was learned. The coal set down.

But if he could release that—if he could let go of the most justified rage he had ever known, could set down the burden of hatred earned through betrayal and cruelty and systematic destruction—what else might be released?

What else had he carried that did not need to be carried?

The bargain he had believed in. The faith that usefulness purchased safety. The performance of devotion in exchange for protection that never came. The conviction that the world made sense, that justice existed, that right action earned right result.

All of it. Beliefs he had never questioned because questioning seemed dangerous or pointless or simply unthinkable. Certainties he had built his life upon that had proven not certain at all but merely convenient fictions, stories he told himself to make the world navigable.

If the hatred could be questioned and released, what else?

Everything. The thought arrived with the force of revelation burning brighter than the flames consuming his flesh. Everything could be questioned. Everything was questionable. Every certainty was merely belief wearing certainty's mask. Every truth was true only until examination revealed it as assumption, performance, the story believed into seeming-solid but dissolving under scrutiny.

He could question everything.

The need burned hotter than fire, brighter than pain. A hunger deeper than the body's dying, older than this life, persistent as the soul's urge to understand, to know, to find what was true beneath what was believed.

Somewhere ahead—he could not see it, could only feel it like compass-pull toward distant shore—there was a time when doubt would be permitted. When questions would be tools instead of crimes. When a man might examine every belief, test every certainty, ask *is this true?* without burning for the audacity of inquiry.

When skepticism would be virtue rather than heresy. When nothing would be sacred except the search itself. When even God could be questioned and the questioning would be holy because truth mattered more than comfort, more than tradition, more than the desperate human need for certainty in a world that offered none.

Diego's vision was failing. The plaza darkening. Voices distant. Pain becoming abstract, a condition rather than sensation, the body's final protests before dissolution.

But the question remained. Bright. Clear. Insistent.

*What is true? Not what am I told. Not what is safe to believe. What is actually, demonstrably true?*

The hunger for that question—the need to pursue it without constraint, without danger, without having to perform belief while suspecting doubt—pulled at something in him that was not his body, not his name, not the meat burning at Toledo's stake.

Something that persisted. Something that would continue. Something that needed new flesh, new time, new circumstances where doubt could be pursued to its conclusion and every certainty could be tested against reality until only what survived testing remained.

The urge forward was powerful as gravity, inevitable as flame seeking air. Diego—or what remained of Diego, what had always been more than Diego, what would be someone else in time and place still forming from the ash of this burning—reached toward that future with hunger that transcended the body's dying.

A time of questions. A time of skepticism. A time when *is this true?* would be the beginning of wisdom rather than the beginning of suffering.

The need for that time burned brighter than flesh burning.

Ready to question.

Ready to doubt.

Ready to find what remained when every belief had been examined and every certainty tested and every comfortable lie had been stripped away to reveal the truth beneath—whatever that truth proved to be, however uncomfortable, however strange.

The flames took his breath. His heart stuttered. Failed. The meat that had been Diego de Lucena burned toward ash, and something else—something that had worn his flesh but was not limited to it—burned forward through darkness toward light still gathering, toward a life not yet begun, toward a century where doubt would be permitted and questions would be welcomed and the search for truth would matter more than the safety of unexamined belief.

The hunger pulled him forward like flame toward air.

Ready.

Released.

Burning toward the next lesson, the next flesh, the next chance to learn what this life had finally taught:

That hatred was a choice. That release was possible. That everything—everything—could be questioned.

And in the questioning, freedom.

The darkness took him. The light ahead grew brighter. Somewhere in the space between lives, between the meat burning at a stake and the meat not yet conceived, consciousness burned forward.

Ready to doubt.

Ready to question everything.

Ready.
