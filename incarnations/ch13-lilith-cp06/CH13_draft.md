# Chapter 13: The Turning

## Lilith CP06 — After Heian Japan

---

The afternoon light entered Lilith's office at an angle that made her patient squint—a woman in her late forties, hands clasped in her lap with the particular tightness of someone holding herself together. Caroline Webb. Third session. The intake notes mentioned divorce, adult children who had stopped calling, a face she no longer recognised in mirrors.

"I used to be beautiful," Caroline said. The words arrived without self-pity, which made them worse. "Not fishing for compliments. Just—I was. And now I catch my reflection in shop windows and think, who is that? Where did the other one go?"

Lilith let the silence hold. Outside, a door closed somewhere down the corridor.

"What would it mean," she asked, "if the other one isn't coming back?"

Caroline's hands tightened further, knuckles whitening. "Then what was the point? All those years of being looked at, being wanted, being—" She stopped. Swallowed. "If it just disappears, what was any of it for?"

"You're describing beauty as something you had. A possession." Lilith kept her voice even, a surface without current. "What if it was something that moved through you instead? Something that was never yours to keep?"

Caroline's face did something complicated—resistance and recognition fighting for the same space.

"That sounds like giving up."

"Does it?" Lilith turned her pen once, slowly. "Or does it sound like stopping a war you were never going to win?"

The session continued for another twenty minutes—Caroline circling the same wound from different angles, Lilith offering questions that opened rather than closed. When the hour ended, they scheduled the follow-up with the particular formality of people who had touched something raw and needed distance from it.

The door clicked shut.

Lilith completed her notes with the efficiency of long practice. *Presents with identity disruption secondary to perceived loss of physical attractiveness. Core wound: self-worth fused with external validation. Recommended continued exploration of intrinsic vs. attributed value.*

The words came easily. The analysis was sound.

She checked the time. Her birthday dinner was in two hours.

---

The wine bar occupied a corner of the Northern Quarter that had been a textile warehouse, then a nightclub, then empty for a decade, and now held exposed brick and copper lighting fixtures with the careful carelessness of spaces designed to seem undesigned. Rain had threatened all afternoon and finally arrived as Lilith walked from the tram stop, fat drops that darkened the pavement in spreading coins.

She found the table near the back. Meera was already there—of course Meera was already there, Meera who had never been late to anything in the fifteen years Lilith had known her—along with two others: Sophie Chen, who taught something in the medical school that Lilith could never quite remember, and Adaora Obi, a solicitor whose firm had handled Lilith's flat purchase and who had somehow become a friend in the process.

"The birthday girl." Meera rose to embrace her, the familiar scent of cocoa butter and something floral. "Thirty looks good on you."

"Thirty looks exactly like twenty-nine." Lilith slid into her seat, accepted the glass of wine that Sophie pushed toward her. "Which looked exactly like twenty-eight. I'm beginning to suspect the whole system is arbitrary."

"Says the woman who doesn't age." Adaora's voice carried the particular dryness of someone who had spent the afternoon in contract negotiations. "Some of us are going grey, Lilith. Some of us are finding new lines every morning."

"You're thirty-two."

"And counting."

The conversation settled into its familiar rhythm—work complaints and weekend plans, the particular shorthand of women who had known each other through various configurations of crisis and contentment. Sophie was dating someone new, or possibly not dating someone new, the distinction unclear even to her. Adaora's firm was restructuring in ways that might mean promotion or might mean redundancy. Meera had transferred to the psychiatric liaison team at the Royal Infirmary, which meant better hours but more paperwork.

"Speaking of mental health," Sophie said, refilling glasses with the casual expertise of someone who had done this many times, "did you see that piece in the Guardian? About preventative Botox?"

"Preventative." Adaora's eyebrows rose. "As in, before you need it?"

"Before you show any signs of ageing whatsoever. Twenty-five-year-olds getting injections so they never develop expression lines." Sophie shook her head, a gesture that carried more fascination than disapproval. "The argument is that if you paralyse the muscles early enough, the creases never form."

"That's—" Meera paused, searching for the word. "Bleak? Is bleak the right word?"

"Expensive is the word. Three hundred quid every four months, minimum, for the rest of your life." Adaora swirled her wine. "Though I suppose if you're starting at twenty-five, you've got forty years of smooth forehead to amortise it over."

"It's not just Botox anymore." Sophie leaned forward, warming to the subject. "Threads. Fillers. That thing where they inject your own blood plasma back into your face. A woman at my gym gets something called a 'liquid facelift' every six months. She's thirty-four."

"Fighting the decay," Adaora said, and the word landed in the centre of the table like a stone dropped into still water.

*Decay.*

Lilith's hand paused around her glass. The word resonated somewhere deeper than the conversation warranted—echoed against images she had been carrying for months. A garden that refused to change. Silk screens held in artificial perfection. A stasis field maintained by bleeding hands.

"What about you, Lilith?" Sophie was looking at her now, the question genuine rather than rhetorical. "You never seem bothered by any of this. What's your secret?"

The table's attention shifted. Three women watching her with the particular curiosity reserved for people who seemed to have solved a problem everyone else was still working on.

Lilith set down her glass. "Everything changes. Fighting it seems exhausting."

"That's it?" Adaora's scepticism was affectionate but real. "Just acceptance?"

"There's something beautiful about the fact that it doesn't last." The words came easily—she had said versions of them to patients, to herself, to anyone who asked. "The body isn't a project. It's a vehicle. You maintain it, you use it, and eventually you return it."

"Return it where?"

"Back to where it came from." Lilith smiled, the expression genuine and also performing its own genuineness. "The universe doesn't care about your skincare routine."

Meera laughed—a warm sound that cut through the table's slight tension. "Very Buddhist of you."

"Very practical," Lilith corrected. "I've just decided not to spend my life at war with entropy."

The conversation moved on. Sophie recounted a disaster date. Adaora complained about a client who kept changing their mind. The wine bottles emptied and were replaced.

But Meera's attention returned, several times, to Lilith's face. The particular scrutiny of someone who had known her long enough to recognise the difference between presence and performance.

"You're somewhere else tonight."

The words came during a lull, when Sophie and Adaora were debating the dessert menu with the gravity of treaty negotiations. Meera said it quietly, not an accusation but an observation.

Lilith met her eyes. "What do you mean?"

"You're here, you're saying all the right things, you're—" Meera gestured vaguely. "Present. But there's this thing underneath. Like you're listening for something we can't hear."

The silence between them held a weight the rest of the table didn't notice.

"Long week," Lilith said. "Clinical load's been heavy."

"Mmm." Meera accepted this without accepting it. "How's Nadia? The wedding was last month, wasn't it?"

"Beautiful." Lilith was grateful for the subject change, and aware of being grateful, and aware that Meera probably recognised both. "She and Marcus looked genuinely happy. And my mother managed to hold her tongue through the entire reception."

"A miracle."

"A small one. She and Jeff have found their equilibrium, I think. They're less—" She searched for the word. "Effortful. About being a unit."

"That's good." Meera's hand found hers briefly, a gesture of connection that asked nothing except to be acknowledged. "You should visit more. She misses you."

"I will."

The words were true and also not true—a commitment that required nothing to make because Lilith could not, at this moment, see what keeping it would require.

The evening wound toward its natural conclusion. Dessert was split four ways. A final toast was raised to thirty years of being alive and whatever the next thirty might bring. Outside, the rain had stopped, leaving the streets with that particular shine of wet pavement reflecting sodium light.

Hugs on the pavement. Promises to do this again soon. The particular warmth of friendships maintained through scheduled contact.

Then the others were gone, and Lilith stood alone on the corner of a Northern Quarter street, Manchester's autumn air cool against her skin.

*Somewhere else.* Yes. She had been somewhere else. She had been thinking of gardens that refused to wilt, of a courtier dying in the mud with a woman who was finally, terribly real. She had been thinking of preservation—of faces and worlds and the desperate human project of stopping time.

She had given perfect advice about accepting impermanence. She had meant every word of it.

And three months ago, she had spent weeks maintaining a stasis field in Heian Japan, trying to trap a soul in eternal beauty, trying to freeze a moment of flesh against the wheel's turning.

The irony did not occur to her. She was not looking for it.

She walked toward home through streets still wet from rain, her mind already turning toward the notebooks in her flat, toward the threads she had been following through lifetimes she had witnessed and shaped.

She had a birthday to finish. The work was waiting.

---


Night had settled over Manchester by the time she reached her flat. The building's corridor held its usual smell of other people's dinners—something with garlic from 4B, the vegetarian downstairs doing something unfortunate with lentils. Her key found the lock with the precision of long repetition.

Inside, the flat waited with the particular stillness of spaces kept deliberately empty. Functional furniture. Minimal decoration. The tracking corner by the window, where a cushion and a low table held her notebooks and the evidence of five years' work.

She did not turn on the main lights. The city's glow filtered through uncurtained windows, enough to navigate by, enough to see the shapes of things without their details.

Her birthday had ended. Or begun, depending on how one counted.

Thirty years old. The number meant nothing and everything—a threshold her culture had invested with significance, a marker on a timeline that stretched far longer than any calendar could measure. She had been older than thirty before. She would be older than thirty again.

But this body, this configuration, this Lilith Azami with her psychiatric credentials and her Manchester flat and her friends who worried she was somewhere else—this one had reached thirty today. The vehicle had logged another year.

She changed out of her dinner clothes. Washed her face. Attended to the body's requirements with the efficiency of someone preparing for work that would demand everything.

Then she settled into her corner. Spine straight. Hands open on her thighs, palms up, fingers slightly curved. The posture she had refined over five years until it felt less like sitting and more like anchoring.

The Heian thread was waiting. Had been waiting for three months, since she had set the intervention in motion and stepped back to let it unfold. Tonight she would see how it ended.

She closed her eyes. Let her breathing slow to something tidal. Reached backward through time toward the disaster she had made.

---

The transition came more easily now than it had in the early years. Consciousness thinning at its edges. The membrane between present and past becoming permeable, then porous, then absent.

She found the thread and followed it.

The Seiryō Pavilion materialised around her awareness—not as a place she occupied but as a place she witnessed, present and not-present, watching from a distance that had nothing to do with space. The gardens she had cultivated through months of careful pressure. The screens she had kept pristine. The woman she had constructed as eternal beauty, preserved against time like a butterfly pinned under glass.

But something was wrong.

The sky above the pavilion churned with colours that did not belong to the careful palette she had maintained. Greys and greens and the particular yellow-brown of storms gathering force. Wind moved through the garden in gusts that bent the carefully shaped pines, sent fallen leaves skittering across paths that should have held no fallen leaves at all.

The stasis was failing.

She reached for the mechanism—for the pressure she had been maintaining from across centuries, the subtle compulsion that drove her instrument to preserve what should not be preserved.

The Attendant.

She found her in the garden, running between the beds with movements that held the particular desperation of someone fighting a battle already lost. Hands bleeding from work they had been doing for hours. Face streaked with rain that was beginning to fall. The same face Lilith saw in mirrors—the sharp widow's peak, the strand of darker hair escaping over the left temple, the left eye that would show its pale green crescent in better light.

The Attendant was her. One of her own past incarnations, a woman born in this time with the same soul-pattern, living a life she did not remember living. Lilith had found her almost by accident while tracking the Heian thread—had recognised the resonance of her own deeper signature and understood what was possible.

She had pushed.

Not possession. Not control. Something subtler and in some ways worse. She had leaned into her past self from across a thousand years, applied pressure to the places where consciousness was pliable, and watched her own ancient incarnation develop obsessions she could not explain. The manic devotion to the pavilion. The bleeding hands that scrubbed surfaces already clean. The absolute certainty that Lady Hotaru must be preserved, must be kept beautiful, must never be allowed to decay.

The Attendant did not understand why she did these things. She only knew that she must.

And now the storm was tearing it all apart.

Lilith tried to strengthen the pressure. Pushed harder against her past self, trying to drive her toward some action that might save the intervention—

But she could not see clearly while pushing. The effort fragmented her attention, scattered her witness-consciousness into static. She was either steering or watching. She could not do both.

The choice crystallised: keep pushing blind, or release and see.

She released.

The effect was immediate. Across a thousand years, the Attendant stumbled mid-stride, her manic energy draining like water from a cracked vessel. She stood in the rain-lashed garden, chest heaving, bleeding hands hanging at her sides, and looked around at the destruction with the particular confusion of someone waking from a fever dream.

*What have I been doing? Why am I here?*

Lilith watched her own past self turn in a slow circle, taking in the torn screens, the scattered lanterns, the garden surrendering to the storm. The Attendant's face held no understanding—only the bewilderment of someone who had lost months to a compulsion that had evaporated without explanation.

Then she walked away.

Simply walked away, through the ruined gate, into the storm, toward whatever life remained to her after months of inexplicable obsession. Free now. Finally free, without ever knowing what she had been freed from.

Lilith watched her go—watched herself go, a woman she had been and did not remember being, disappearing into rain and darkness and the ordinary flow of a life she would never recall.

---

Without the Attendant's maintenance, the illusion collapsed entirely.

The screens tore from their frames and scattered across the garden like wounded birds. Lanterns that had burned without oil guttered and died. The stasis field—that careful construction of preserved beauty—shattered under the storm's indifferent force.

And in the pavilion's heart, stripped of every deception, Lady Hotaru lay dying.

Lilith found Kaoru there.

He had come through the storm, this courtier who should have been trapped in eternal longing, this soul she had tried to bind with beauty that never faded. He knelt in the mud beside a woman who was finally, terribly real—old and ill and mortal, her face showing every year the stasis had hidden, her body surrendering to the decay that Lilith had tried to weaponise against him.

He was holding her. Cradling her against his chest as the rain fell through the ruined roof, as the wind tore away the last pretences of perfection.

Lilith watched his face.

The courtier who had been trained since childhood to feel everything correctly, to respond to beauty with the appropriate aesthetic sensitivity, to perform his responses for an audience of refined observers—that man was gone. What remained was simpler. Rawer. A human being holding another human being as she died.

His lips moved. She could not hear the words, but she caught their shape, their meaning, the insight crystallising in him like ice forming on still water:

*It is beautiful because it is dying.*

The thought arrived in her awareness with the particular clarity of spiritual breakthrough—not as words he spoke but as understanding he achieved, a recognition that passed through him and changed something fundamental in its passing.

Everything she had built to trap him in desire—the perfect garden, the ageless beauty, the romance frozen in amber—had taught him the opposite lesson. The absence of impermanence was monstrous. The stasis was the horror, not the decay. Beauty required its own ending to mean anything at all.

Another acceleration. Another backfire.

She had given him exactly what he needed to progress.

---

Kaoru did not survive the night. The exposure, the exhaustion, the something-broken that happened when a soul achieves insight it is not yet ready to integrate—he died as dawn approached, still holding Hotaru, his face peaceful in a way that the living rarely managed.

Lilith watched the light leave his eyes and felt the thread dim.

The connection was fading. The effort of maintaining her witness-state across this distance, combined with the collapse of everything she had built—she could feel her reach weakening, her consciousness beginning to withdraw toward its proper place in time.

But before the thread went dark entirely, a thought surfaced unbidden:

*Is he here now? Somewhere in this time?*

She had been tracking his thread backward through history—through Heian Japan, through the Egyptian desert, through lives she had witnessed and interventions she had shaped. But the thread extended forward too. From Kaoru's death through centuries she had not yet traced, through incarnations she did not yet know, toward... when? Where?

Somewhere ahead, at the end of this chain, he existed in her world. His soul would surface in her own time, wearing a face she had not yet learned to recognise.

She could not skip ahead. Each life had to be traced through the next, the connection built link by link. To find where the thread emerged in her present, she would have to follow it through every incarnation between Heian Japan and now. Years of work. Maybe longer.

The thought settled into her like a seed finding soil.

And beneath it, another thought, harder to hold:

She had pushed her own past self. Used her own incarnation as an instrument without knowing whose hand she was using.

*How many other lives had she lived?*

She had spent five years tracking his thread. She had barely glanced at her own.

The connection broke. The Heian world dissolved into static, then silence, then the ordinary darkness behind her closed eyes.

Manchester reassembled around her. The flat. The tracking corner. The city's distant sounds filtering through windows she had not curtained.

Her hands were trembling. A headache pulsed at the edges of her awareness—the particular pressure of consciousness that had stretched beyond its usual reach.

The thread was dark. Would stay dark for months while whatever mechanism governed these things recovered from the effort.

She opened her eyes to a city that had not changed, a flat that held no evidence of where she had been, a birthday that had ended without celebration.

The failure was complete. The intervention had backfired.

And somewhere in the gap between what she had intended and what had occurred, a question waited that she was not yet ready to ask.

---


She did not sleep.

The flat held its silence around her—the particular quiet of small hours when even Manchester's traffic thinned to occasional passages, when the building settled into its own rhythms of cooling pipes and shifting foundations. The headache had retreaded to a dull presence at her temples. Her hands had steadied.

She remained in her corner, though the tracking was finished. Not reaching now. Just sitting. Processing.

For five years, the cost had been attentional. The mental effort of reaching across time, the discipline required to maintain connection, the strain of holding witness-consciousness stable across distances that had nothing to do with miles. She had learned to push through it. Her practice had deepened until the effort, while still significant, no longer threatened to overwhelm her. The reaching had become, if not easy, then at least sustainable.

She had assumed the challenge was capacity. Train hard enough, refine technique sufficiently, and the limits would continue to recede.

Tonight had shown her otherwise.

---

She reviewed the intervention with the clinical detachment she brought to case notes.

The Attendant had been fully under her influence. The pressure had held for months—her past self driven by compulsions she could not question, maintaining the stasis field with bleeding devotion. The garden had remained perfect. Lady Hotaru had been preserved. Every element of the construction had functioned exactly as designed.

And it had backfired anyway.

Not because of some failure in execution. Not because she lacked the power or the precision or the will. The mechanism had worked. The intervention had succeeded on every technical level.

The outcome had been exactly wrong.

She turned the pattern over in her mind, examining it from angles she had been avoiding:

Force created suffering—and suffering clarified. The pressures she applied became crucibles that refined rather than corrupted. The hermit in Egypt, forced to confront his hunger for recognition, had achieved genuine humility through the collapse she engineered. The courtier in Heian, trapped in artificial perfection, had recognised the necessity of impermanence.

Subtlety created mirrors—and mirrors revealed. The careful manipulations, the precisely positioned triggers, became surfaces in which her targets saw themselves more clearly. Every trap she laid became a tool for self-knowledge.

Even success backfired. Especially success. The more perfectly her interventions functioned, the more precisely they delivered the opposite of their intended effect.

The harder she pushed, the faster he progressed.

---

She had been thinking of this as a problem of refinement. Adjust the approach. Increase the precision. Find the intervention subtle enough, the pressure light enough, that it would finally stick.

But the pattern suggested something else entirely.

She reached for an analogy and found one in the technical language of systems she had studied in another context: the noise floor.

In any system designed to detect or transmit signals, there existed a baseline level of interference that could not be eliminated. You could reduce your own contribution to the noise—shield the equipment, filter the input, refine the sensitivity—but beneath all your improvements lay a floor you could not go below. The universe itself generated interference. The substrate had a texture.

She had spent five years lowering her own noise. Deepening her practice. Refining her reach until the tracking felt almost natural, until the effort of maintaining witness-consciousness no longer scattered her attention into static. Her signal had become clean.

But the universe, it seemed, had a noise floor of its own.

Every action raised it. Every intervention, no matter how precise, disturbed something that disturbed something else. The more carefully she shaped her pressure, the more exactly something compensated. Not random interference—something structural. Something that responded to intention itself.

*She had overcome the attentional costs.*

*The noise floor could not be overcome.*

The realisation settled into her like water finding its level. Not a defeat, exactly. An encounter with a different kind of limit. She had been pushing against her own capacity for five years, assuming that was the constraint. Now she understood: the constraint was not in her. It was in the nature of interference itself.

---

A question surfaced, one she had been circling for months without quite formulating:

If blocking his progress was structurally impossible—if every intervention accelerated rather than impeded—then what was she actually doing?

She had been treating this as a race. Two beings approaching the same threshold, only one of whom could cross. Her task: prevent his crossing. Her method: intervention across lifetimes. Her assumption: that opposition served her purpose.

But opposition kept failing. Kept *succeeding* in ways that served his purpose instead.

*Opposing him feels like training.*

The thought arrived unbidden and she held it carefully, examining it without commitment.

Training. As if the resistance she provided was not obstruction but exercise. As if her interventions were not obstacles to his progress but occasions for it. As if she was not blocking his path but—

She stopped the thought there.

*He is the whetstone for my blade.*

That was the frame that made sense. Every failure taught her something. Every backfire revealed a new constraint, a new edge of what was possible. She was learning the shape of the noise floor, mapping its contours, understanding its texture. The competition was not futile—it was preparatory. She was sharpening herself against him, and when she had been sharpened enough, she would finally cut through.

The alternative interpretation—that the sharpening might be mutual, that the training might go both directions, that two whetstones could sharpen each other—flickered at the edge of her awareness and was dismissed.

She had been at this too long to question the premise. Five years of tracking. A lifetime of development before that. She could feel how close she was to something—to completion, to liberation, to the threshold she had been approaching across more incarnations than she could count. She was not going to stop now. She was not going to reconsider the competition itself.

The thread was dark. She could not pursue the next incarnation for months. She had time to sharpen further. Time to find a new approach.

---

But beneath the resolution, something else stirred.

She had pushed her own past self. Used her own incarnation as an instrument without knowing whose soul she was steering. The Attendant had been *her*—born in that time, living a life Lilith did not remember, wearing a face she recognised because it was the face she saw in mirrors.

If she existed in Heian Japan, she existed elsewhere too.

She had spent five years tracking his thread through lifetimes. Watching him stumble and grow and die and be reborn. Learning his patterns, his weaknesses, his progress.

Her own thread ran parallel. Must run parallel. And she had barely glanced at it.

What would she find if she looked?

The question waited, patient as the notebooks beside her, patient as the dawn that was still hours away. Not demanding an answer. Just present.

She filed it for later. There was time. The thread was dark. And she was not yet ready to trace her own path backward through centuries she did not remember walking.

But the question remained, a seed planted in soil that would prove more fertile than she anticipated.

*What have I been?*

*In the times I don't remember—who was I then?*

---


The Heian Lilith had walked away.

A woman she was and did not remember being. A life she had lived and could not recall living. Freed from a pressure she could never have understood, returning to whatever remained of an existence that had been hijacked for months by a future self who needed her hands.

*How many times had she lived?*

The question had been abstract before tonight. Intellectual. She had known, in the way one knows facts that carry no weight, that she must have past incarnations. The Attendant had proven it—the same face, the same soul-pattern, present in Heian Japan a thousand years before her birth in this body. But knowing was not the same as seeing. Understanding was not the same as witnessing.

She had spent five years tracking his thread. Five years watching him die and be reborn, stumble and grow, approach and retreat from thresholds she could name even if he could not. She had become intimate with his pattern—the shape of his soul across centuries, the particular texture of his progress.

Her own thread ran parallel. Must run parallel.

And she had barely glanced at it.

---

The tracking corner held its stillness around her. Predawn light was beginning to suggest itself at the edges of the windows—not yet visible, but present as a pressure, as a thinning of the dark.

She did not reach for his thread. That connection was exhausted, would remain dark for months. But she had other options she had never fully explored.

She turned her attention inward. Not outward across time, but downward. Toward her own roots.

The thread was there.

Of course it was there. It had always been there—the continuity that made her *her* across configurations, the pattern that persisted through death and birth and death again. She had been aware of it the way one was aware of one's own heartbeat: constant, fundamental, ignored.

Now she looked.

---

The past extended backward through time like a corridor glimpsed in flickering light. Lives she had lived but did not remember. Faces she had worn. Deaths she had died. The thread of her own continuity stretching back through centuries toward origins she could not perceive.

She let her attention move along it, tentative as a hand extended into darkness.

Glimpses. Fragments. Nothing as clear as the tracking she had refined over five years—this was new territory, unpracticed, the equivalent of reaching with a limb she had never learned to use.

A woman in robes she did not recognise. Linen, perhaps, or something older. A city of white stone and water, columns and crowds and the particular quality of Mediterranean light. Alexandria, maybe. Or somewhere that shared its bones. The woman—the Lilith—moved through a marketplace with purpose, and something about the set of her shoulders suggested a life spent in service to knowledge. A physician's wife? A scholar's daughter? The image flickered before she could resolve it.

Darkness. Confined spaces. The smell of illness—not her own illness, but the illness of others, close and constant. Stone walls. A window too small to climb through. Someone tending the sick in a place where sickness was expected to end in death. The face she wore in that life was thinner, harder, aged by circumstances this Lilith could not read. A plague? A prison? Both?

A figure in silk, in a court that was not Heian but shared its formality. Somewhere in China, perhaps—the dynasty unclear, the architecture suggesting wealth and constraint in equal measure. She moved through corridors designed to display status, wearing robes that encoded meaning she no longer understood. A concubine? An attendant to power? Someone close enough to influence to understand its costs.

Others, further back. Harder to resolve. The thread dimming as it extended toward origins she could not perceive—not because the origins were not there, but because her capacity to see them was not yet developed. Faces that might have been hers. Lives that might have been lived. The accumulated weight of a soul that had been walking this path for longer than she had ever consciously considered.

*She had been on this path across lifetimes too.*

---

The realisation carried implications she was not ready to examine.

If his progress seemed inevitable—if every intervention accelerated rather than obstructed—what about hers?

She was close. She could feel how close she was to something. Completion. Liberation. The threshold she had been approaching across more incarnations than she could count. In this life, with this configuration, she had come further than she ever had before. The tracking. The interventions. The understanding she had accumulated over five years of watching him and three decades of her own development.

Had she always been this close?

Or had the pursuit itself been advancing her?

His thread and hers ran parallel. She could see that now—not just adjacent, but *parallel*, moving through time in some kind of tandem she had never examined. When he advanced, she...

She did not complete the thought.

But the shape of it was there, waiting. A pattern she was not yet willing to trace to its conclusion.

---

She reached for her notebook. The pen moved with the deliberate steadiness of someone recording data rather than examining its implications.

*The noise floor. I cannot go beneath it. Every action raises the interference.*

*I pushed my own past self. I was the Attendant. I have been here before.*

*His thread surfaces somewhere in my time. I have to trace it forward to find where.*

A pause. The pen hovering.

*But my thread—where does it lead? What have I been, in the times I don't remember? What am I becoming?*

She wrote one more line, then crossed it out with a single stroke. The words remained legible beneath the cancellation:

*If his progress is inevitable, is mine?*

She closed the notebook. Set down the pen.

The question would wait. Everything would wait. The thread was dark and the dawn was coming and she had a life to maintain—patients and colleagues and friends who thought they knew her, a career that provided cover for work they could not imagine.

But the glimpses remained. Alexandria and darkness and silk. Lives she had lived without knowing she was living them. A path she had been walking longer than memory could hold.

She was not alone in her pursuit. She was not unique in her approach to the threshold.

She had always been here. She had always been doing this.

The only question was what happened when two parallel lines finally met.

---


Light crept into the flat by degrees—first as a greying of the darkness, then as colour returning to surfaces that had spent the night as shapes without detail. The tracking corner emerged from shadow: the cushion where she still sat, the low table with its notebooks, the window that framed a Manchester sky shifting from black to the particular pewter that preceded sunrise.

Her thirtieth birthday had ended. Or begun, depending on how one counted.

She had been awake all night, but her body did not feel tired. It felt clarified. Emptied of something that had been taking up space, refilled with something she did not yet have words for. The failure had done what failures sometimes did: stripped away assumptions she had not known she was carrying.

She took stock.

---

What she had lost:

The Heian intervention was over. Months of careful work, collapsed in a single storm. The stasis field she had maintained through bleeding hands that were not quite her own—gone. The trap she had constructed to bind a soul in eternal longing—sprung in the wrong direction. Catastrophic failure by any measure she had been using.

The thread was dark. Would remain dark for months, perhaps longer. The effort of pushing herself, the collapse of everything she had built, the noise she had raised—it would take time for the connection to recover. She could not track forward to the Inquisition avatar. Could not pursue the next incarnation until the interference settled.

Her ability to push her own past self was confirmed but limited. She could steer, or she could watch. She could not do both. The mechanism worked, but its constraints were tighter than she had hoped.

What she had gained:

Understanding of the noise floor. A limit that was not about her capacity but about the nature of interference itself. She had spent five years pushing against her own edges; now she knew there were edges that could not be pushed. The universe compensated. Something structural resisted. This was not a problem to solve but a condition to navigate.

First glimpses of her own past lives. Alexandria and darkness and silk. Lives she had lived without remembering, faces she had worn without recognition. She was not just tracking his thread through time—she was walking her own thread, had been walking it for longer than memory could hold. The Attendant was not an anomaly. She had always been here.

The beginning of questions she was not yet ready to answer. About inevitability. About parallel progress. About what it meant that every failure deepened her understanding the way every intervention accelerated his.

A new goal: trace his thread forward, life by life, until she found where it surfaced in her time. He existed somewhere in her present. She just had to find him.

A new question: what would she learn if she traced her own thread with the same dedication she had brought to tracing his?

She rose from her corner. Her legs protested the hours of stillness, muscles stiff with the particular ache of bodies that had been held too long in meditation. She moved to the window.

Manchester spread below in the early light—rooftops and streets and the distant suggestion of hills beyond the urban edge. A city waking to an ordinary Tuesday, unaware of the woman in its midst who had spent the night reaching across centuries.

The Inquisition avatar waited. A soul who had learned that beauty required impermanence, now facing a crucible that would teach something else—the strength to endure reality without fleeing into illusion. Patience. The perfection that emerged from suffering rather than from its absence.

She would need a new strategy when the thread recovered. Not force—force created suffering that clarified. Not manipulation—manipulation created mirrors that revealed. Something she had not tried yet. Something she would have months to consider.

But for now, she stood in the grey light of a Manchester dawn, thirty years old, five years into a pursuit she could not abandon.

She was closer than she had ever been. To what, she could not quite name. But the proximity was real, a pressure in her chest, a thinning of the membrane between herself and something vast.

The thread was dark. The wheel kept turning.

And somewhere in the gap between lives, in the space between deaths and births, two patterns continued their long weave toward a meeting neither of them yet expected.
