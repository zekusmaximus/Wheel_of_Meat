# Chapter 13 - Lilith: First Manifestation

## Context
Following Chapter 12 (Heian Courtier - Japan)

## Power Level
**Brief manifestation**

## Capabilities
- Can appear momentarily in past lives
- First physical presence

## Limitations
- Appearances brief and draining
- Cannot sustain presence
- Requires recovery

## Intervention
Appears as object of desire to bind him through sensual attachment

## Objective This Chapter
Her first physical appearance—she manifests as an object of desire. The Heian court's aesthetic obsession with beauty makes this the ideal battleground. If she can make him crave her across lifetimes, she wins.

## Backfire
[TBD]

## Emotional State
A new strategy; perhaps something personal is emerging

## Notes
[Add chapter draft and development notes here]

**Reader Note:** By this chapter, readers should recognize her immediately even though the avatar does not.
