She had been closer than she'd ever been. The memory surfaced in her hands before her mind could intercept it. The weight of lacquer trays, the texture of silk sleeves brushing doorframes, the ache of knees pressed against wooden floors for hours of arranged stillness.

The Attendant had been hers. A vessel she had worn like a garment, and the garment had left creases.

In her flat, Lilith's hands remembered raw. Not her hands, but the vessel's hans. She felt them anyway: the scrubbing and obsessive maintenance that had made perfect sense at the time. Keep the screens clean. Burn the autumn leaves before they can rot. Preserve the spring that Lady Hotaru needed, that Kaoru craved, that neither of them understood was already dead.

She had been *there*. In the room when he arrived. Standing against lacquered wood while he settled into cushions placed exactly where she had placed them. His eyes had moved through the space, they had moved *to her*. For a moment that lasted longer than a moment should last, he had looked.

The looking arrived now as warmth. Not the ceramic warming against her palm, though that too. Something beneath: the memory of being seen, of having a face that was not quite the servant's face, of existing in his awareness as more than furniture.

He had not recognized her. Her features were the vessel's features: servant features, forgettable features, a body meant to move silently and accomplish tasks without being observed accomplishing them. But beneath the vessel, the same face she always wore, the widow's peak, dark strand falling left, the pale-green crescent in the eye that only appeared in good light, that face had pressed toward visibility.

She had wanted him to recognize her.

The thought was inadmissible. She filed it before it could complete: *vessel mechanics creating perception noise. Proximity operations require processing time. The pull toward him is tactical—strategic positioning for subsequent intervention.*

Each label was a wall. She built them quickly, efficiently, with the precision of long practice.

The Attendant had burned autumn leaves. Had scrubbed floors until the lacquer shone like water, like moonlight, like the beauty Hotaru required to survive. The Attendant had maintained an impossible spring because spring was what Kaoru came for, what he stayed for, what he could not release because releasing it would mean accepting that beauty required decay to be real.

Lilith had felt the compulsion from the inside. The desperate maintenance. The vigil against time.

In her flat, objects remained arranged. Tea had been made and drunk without her noticing the drinking. The thread hummed forward through episodes she had already witnessed, and she followed them again. The Attendant's devotion, the preservation that was also corruption, the moment when static perfection had become its own refutation.

She had been close. Close enough to touch.

The words returned unbidden: *I was there. Something was different.*

Close enough to be seen, though he had not seen.

Close enough to feel his presence register in flesh she had borrowed for the purpose of feeling.

The purpose. She held the word steady. *Tactical*. *Positioning*. *Strategy*.

The walls remained sound. For now.
