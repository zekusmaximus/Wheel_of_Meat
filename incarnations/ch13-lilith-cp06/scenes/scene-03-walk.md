# Scene III: The University Walk

She needed air.

The realization arrived as body-knowledge, bypassing the consciousness that should have intervened: her legs moving before her mind could question, jacket on, door opening, November cold against skin that had been warmth-wrapped for days she couldn't count precisely.

Manchester. Real Manchester—not the peripheral hum that accompanied tracking, but concrete underfoot and drizzle on her face and the particular smell of late autumn in a city that was mostly rain. She walked without destination. Her body knew where to go.

Kaoru walked too, somewhere in that other awareness. Through pavilions designed for walking, for the cultivation of transient beauty, for the particular appreciation of things that would not stay. He walked to Lady Hotaru. She walked—

She did not know where she walked.

Stone buildings resolved from drizzle. Autumn trees that were really autumn, not burned to maintain impossible spring, their leaves turning and falling and rotting without intervention. The university emerged not as destination but as arrival: she was here before she had decided to come here.

Philosophy faculty. The sign registered without processing.

The campus held its own aesthetic—Victorian gravity softened by wet light, Gothic verticals complicated by modern intrusions, the accumulated beauty of purpose that had outlasted its original intentions. She saw it freshly. The Heian bleeding through made everything luminous: architecture as impermanence, stone as temporary, even the rain beautiful in its falling.

She circled the buildings without entering. Alone. Observing.

*He is in this world.*

The thought surfaced without warning—not about Kaoru, centuries dead, but about something else, someone she had not yet met, a consciousness she tracked backward from origin rather than forward from present.

*Walking. Teaching. Present.*

She stopped. The thought was inadmissible. She had tracked ten incarnations now. She knew where the thread led—forward through time, through lives, through accumulated merit that she was supposed to be interrupting. The thread led to *now*, to Manchester, to—

*What if I focused on my own liberation?*

The second thought arrived harder. Sharper. She was so close. One fetter remaining. If she couldn't stop him—

She filed the thought before it completed. Strategy. Refinement. The pattern required adjustment, not abandonment.

But she had walked here. Her body had led where her mind refused to examine, and she stood now in the rain outside buildings where he would be—*was*, somewhere in a present she had not yet permitted herself to occupy.

The walk back was slower. She noticed objects: a rusted bicycle lock, leaves collecting in a gutter, the way light pooled in windows where evening had begun to gather. Beauty everywhere, not because the Heian period had saturated her perception—she rejected that interpretation—but because perception was simply... sharpened. Heightened awareness. The mechanics of tracking required grounding in contemporary space.

*That is why I came here*, she told herself.

*Grounding.*

The word held.

The flat welcomed her back with its arranged stillness. Objects where she had placed them, or where something in her had placed them while she wasn't counting days. The thread hummed—Kaoru moving toward Lady Hotaru, toward the Attendant, toward the moment when frozen beauty would teach him that beauty cannot be frozen.

She had walked to the university without knowing why.

She had thought about her own liberation.

She had stood in the rain outside philosophy faculty and felt something that strategy could not contain.

*Tactical*, she decided. *Positioning for subsequent phases.*

The filing was perfect. The walls were sound.

But she could still feel the November cold on her skin, and something beneath strategy—beneath the walls, beneath the filing—hummed at the same frequency as the thread she followed.
