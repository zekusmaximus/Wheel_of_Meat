# Chapter 13, Section IV: Exploration

---

The Heian Lilith had walked away.

A woman she was and did not remember being. A life she had lived and could not recall living. Freed from a pressure she could never have understood, returning to whatever remained of an existence that had been hijacked for months by a future self who needed her hands.

*How many times had she lived?*

The question had been abstract before tonight. Intellectual. She had known, in the way one knows facts that carry no weight, that she must have past incarnations. The Attendant had proven it—the same face, the same soul-pattern, present in Heian Japan a thousand years before her birth in this body. But knowing was not the same as seeing. Understanding was not the same as witnessing.

She had spent five years tracking his thread. Five years watching him die and be reborn, stumble and grow, approach and retreat from thresholds she could name even if he could not. She had become intimate with his pattern—the shape of his soul across centuries, the particular texture of his progress.

Her own thread ran parallel. Must run parallel.

And she had barely glanced at it.

---

The tracking corner held its stillness around her. Predawn light was beginning to suggest itself at the edges of the windows—not yet visible, but present as a pressure, as a thinning of the dark.

She did not reach for his thread. That connection was exhausted, would remain dark for months. But she had other options she had never fully explored.

She turned her attention inward. Not outward across time, but downward. Toward her own roots.

The thread was there.

Of course it was there. It had always been there—the continuity that made her *her* across configurations, the pattern that persisted through death and birth and death again. She had been aware of it the way one was aware of one's own heartbeat: constant, fundamental, ignored.

Now she looked.

---

The past extended backward through time like a corridor glimpsed in flickering light. Lives she had lived but did not remember. Faces she had worn. Deaths she had died. The thread of her own continuity stretching back through centuries toward origins she could not perceive.

She let her attention move along it, tentative as a hand extended into darkness.

Glimpses. Fragments. Nothing as clear as the tracking she had refined over five years—this was new territory, unpracticed, the equivalent of reaching with a limb she had never learned to use.

A woman in robes she did not recognise. Linen, perhaps, or something older. A city of white stone and water, columns and crowds and the particular quality of Mediterranean light. Alexandria, maybe. Or somewhere that shared its bones. The woman—the Lilith—moved through a marketplace with purpose, and something about the set of her shoulders suggested a life spent in service to knowledge. A physician's wife? A scholar's daughter? The image flickered before she could resolve it.

Darkness. Confined spaces. The smell of illness—not her own illness, but the illness of others, close and constant. Stone walls. A window too small to climb through. Someone tending the sick in a place where sickness was expected to end in death. The face she wore in that life was thinner, harder, aged by circumstances this Lilith could not read. A plague? A prison? Both?

A figure in silk, in a court that was not Heian but shared its formality. Somewhere in China, perhaps—the dynasty unclear, the architecture suggesting wealth and constraint in equal measure. She moved through corridors designed to display status, wearing robes that encoded meaning she no longer understood. A concubine? An attendant to power? Someone close enough to influence to understand its costs.

Others, further back. Harder to resolve. The thread dimming as it extended toward origins she could not perceive—not because the origins were not there, but because her capacity to see them was not yet developed. Faces that might have been hers. Lives that might have been lived. The accumulated weight of a soul that had been walking this path for longer than she had ever consciously considered.

*She had been on this path across lifetimes too.*

---

The realisation carried implications she was not ready to examine.

If his progress seemed inevitable—if every intervention accelerated rather than obstructed—what about hers?

She was close. She could feel how close she was to something. Completion. Liberation. The threshold she had been approaching across more incarnations than she could count. In this life, with this configuration, she had come further than she ever had before. The tracking. The interventions. The understanding she had accumulated over five years of watching him and three decades of her own development.

Had she always been this close?

Or had the pursuit itself been advancing her?

His thread and hers ran parallel. She could see that now—not just adjacent, but *parallel*, moving through time in some kind of tandem she had never examined. When he advanced, she...

She did not complete the thought.

But the shape of it was there, waiting. A pattern she was not yet willing to trace to its conclusion.

---

She reached for her notebook. The pen moved with the deliberate steadiness of someone recording data rather than examining its implications.

*The noise floor. I cannot go beneath it. Every action raises the interference.*

*I pushed my own past self. I was the Attendant. I have been here before.*

*His thread surfaces somewhere in my time. I have to trace it forward to find where.*

A pause. The pen hovering.

*But my thread—where does it lead? What have I been, in the times I don't remember? What am I becoming?*

She wrote one more line, then crossed it out with a single stroke. The words remained legible beneath the cancellation:

*If his progress is inevitable, is mine?*

She closed the notebook. Set down the pen.

The question would wait. Everything would wait. The thread was dark and the dawn was coming and she had a life to maintain—patients and colleagues and friends who thought they knew her, a career that provided cover for work they could not imagine.

But the glimpses remained. Alexandria and darkness and silk. Lives she had lived without knowing she was living them. A path she had been walking longer than memory could hold.

She was not alone in her pursuit. She was not unique in her approach to the threshold.

She had always been here. She had always been doing this.

The only question was what happened when two parallel lines finally met.
