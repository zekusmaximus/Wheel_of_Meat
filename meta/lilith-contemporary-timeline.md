  - Pushed her own past incarnation (The Attendant IS her)—realizes the Attendant was one of her past lives
  - Witnesses catastrophic backfire in real-time
- **Power level:** Pushing own past self (low agency)—can drive her own past incarnation but cannot integrate modern consciousness
- **Tracking content:**
  - Reviews Heian disaster; watches Kaoru die
  - Releases the push—her past self wakes as if from a dream and walks away
  - Thread fades; will be months before she can track forward
  - Realizes: the thread surfaces in her time, but she must trace it forward life by life
- **Spiritual turning point:**
  - First glimpse of her OWN past lives—she's been on this path across lifetimes too
  - Questions inevitability: if his progress can't be stopped, what about hers?
  - Seeds of realization: opposing him feels like training—for both of them?
  - Crossed-out notebook line: "If his progress is inevitable, is mine?"
- **Emotional state:** Exhausted but intellectually energized; failure pushing her toward questions about her own path
- **Loose threads to address:**
  - What happened at Nadia's wedding? (Lilith present but distracted?)

## Key Relationships

### Family

**Mother (name TBD)**
- Remarried to Jeff between Ch7 and Ch9
- Relationship with Lilith: warm, uncomplicated
- By Ch13: settled into new marriage, getting along well with Nadia

**Nadia (sister)**
- Engaged in Ch7, married between Ch11 and Ch13
- Initial resentment about mother's timing has resolved
- Relationship with Lilith: close but Nadia sometimes feels Lilith is "somewhere else"
- By Ch13: happily married, family drama behind her

**Jeff (stepfather)**
- Introduced Ch7
- Warm, slightly nervous, genuinely loves their mother
- Not the villain Nadia initially painted
- By Ch13: accepted member of family

### Professional

**Dr. Harrow**
- Supervisor/administrator
- Initially adversarial during Luther complaint (Ch9)
- Proved fair; relationship normalized
- By Ch13: professional respect, no longer antagonistic

**Colleagues**
- Generally respect her clinical abilities
- Beginning to notice increasing distraction (Ch11 onward)
- By Ch13: whispers about her being "somewhere else"

### Social

**Meera Okonkwo**
- Friend since university; also friends with Nadia
- Nurse (A&E or psychiatric ward—adjacent to Lilith's medical world)
- Appears at rehearsal dinner (Ch11)
- Appears at 30th birthday gathering (Ch13)
- Perceptive; likely to notice changes in Lilith
- Has seen Lilith through various phases; knows her well enough to clock something's different

**Other friends (Ch13 birthday gathering)**
- [TBD—2-3 others to round out the scene]
- Professional women, late 20s/early 30s
- The conversation about aging/beauty emerges naturally from this demographic

### Romantic

- **No significant relationships during tracking years**
- Preoccupied first with spiritual development, then with tracking
- The awakening of her powers and fascination with progressing further has consumed that energy
- This makes the Chapter 1 relationship with Silas significant—it's her first intimate relationship in years, and it's strategic

---

## Unfulfilled Promises / Loose Threads

### Introduced and Unresolved

1. **"Together doesn't hold"** (Ch7)—her observation about why his isolation attempts fail; never fully examined

2. **"What does that remind me of?"** (Ch11)—the parallel between her observations and her own situation; deliberately not completed

3. **The backfire pattern**—increasingly visible but not yet explained to her satisfaction

4. **The kinship whisper**—growing recognition of connection to Silas that she can't explain

5. **Her own past lives**—has she examined them? Ch13 might be where she starts

### Resolved Between Chapters

1. **Luther complaint** (Ch9 → Ch11)—resolved in her favor

2. **Nadia's wedding tensions** (Ch7 → Ch13)—resolved; family getting along

3. **Jeff's acceptance** (Ch7 → Ch13)—complete; he's part of the family now

---

## The Tracking Corner

A consistent detail across chapters: the corner of her flat where she does her "other work."

- **The notebooks:** Handwritten records of observations, interventions, theories
- **The materials:** Whatever she uses to anchor her practice
- **The ritual:** The position, the breathing, the descent into tracking

This space should feel increasingly significant as chapters progress—the physical anchor for her supernatural work.

## Power Progression Summary

| Chapter | Age | Year | Power Level | Key Capability |
|---------|-----|------|-------------|----------------|
| 3 | 25 | 0 | Observation | Can see past lives |

| 7 | 27-28 | 2-3 | Dream manipulation | Can send specific content |
| 9 | 28 | 3 | Circumstance manipulation | Can arrange events |
| 11 | 29 | 4 | Growing control | Can work through intermediaries precisely |
| 13 | 30 | 5 | Pushing own past self | Can drive her own past incarnation (can't integrate consciousness) |
| 15 | 31 | 6 | Sustained presence | Extended influence over past selves |
| 17 | 32 | 7 | Extended interaction | Can maintain influence longer |
| 19 | 33 | 8 | Near-full manifestation | Almost complete integration |
| 21 | 34 | 9 | Full manifestation | Can incarnate with full consciousness |

## Chapter 13 Development Notes

### The Turning Point

Chapter 13 marks a shift in Lilith's arc:

**Before Ch13:** Costs are attentional/spiritual; she's learning to push through them
**Ch13 turning point:** She's mastered the attentional discipline
**After Ch13:** The limit is karmic disturbance—interventions create counter-pressure regardless of her capacity

### What She Realizes (Without Buddhist Terminology)

- She's close to something—her own liberation feels near
- The competition may not be what she thought
- Opposing him feels like training—for both of them?
- There's a pattern to the backfires that suggests systemic rather than tactical failure
- Perhaps only one being can complete this path per... cycle? World? Era?
- If so, what does that mean for her own progress?

### Questions She Begins Asking

- What are her own past lives? Has she always been pursuing him?
- Is his progress somehow linked to hers?
- Why does every intervention accelerate rather than obstruct?
- What other capabilities might she develop?
- What happens if she stops interfering?

## Notes for Chapter 11 Revision

**Add:** Brief mention of Meera Okonkwo at the rehearsal dinner
- Could be seated near Lilith
- A line of dialogue or observation
- Establishes her presence for Ch13 payoff

**Example insertion point:** During the family dynamics section, Lilith might exchange a glance with Meera—someone who knows the family well enough to appreciate the performance everyone is putting on.
