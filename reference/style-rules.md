# Style Rules: The Wheel of Meat

## Universal Rules (Apply to All Chapters)

### POV Convention
- Close third person throughout
- Stay inside the avatar's consciousness; no head-hopping
- Lilith scenes: when she appears, we stay in the avatar's POV—her interiority is never shown until [TBD - resolution chapter?]

### Prose Principles
- [TBD - Jeffrey's baseline style preferences]
- Avoid filter verbs where possible ("he saw," "she felt," "he noticed")
- Sensory grounding in each scene's opening
- [TBD - sentence rhythm preferences]
- [TBD - dialogue attribution style]

### Forbidden Elements
- No anachronistic language in historical chapters (see period-rules.md per chapter)
- No breaking POV
- No Lilith interiority until designated chapter
- [TBD - any words/phrases to avoid?]

### Soul Continuity
When drafting any avatar, subtly include:
- [TBD - recognition marker 1]
- [TBD - recognition marker 2]
- [TBD - recognition marker 3]

These should be woven in naturally, not flagged for the reader.
