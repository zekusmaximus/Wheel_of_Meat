# Style Rules: The Wheel of Meat

Derived from Chapter 1. See `voice-analysis.md` for full breakdown with examples.

-----

## Universal Rules (Apply to All Chapters)

### POV Convention

- Third person throughout, close but not intimate
- Historical chapters: Follow avatar only
- Lilith chapters: Follow Lilith only
- Contemporary dual chapters (1, 22): Follow both Silas and Lilith, but don’t fully inhabit either
- Lilith’s interiority is partially veiled until Chapter 26
- Interior states rendered through external observation when possible

### Core Prose Patterns

**1. The Undermining Clause**
Nearly every observation is complicated by a second element:

- “A gesture that seemed both innocent and calculated.”
- “An easy empathy almost contrived.”
- Surface acknowledged, then complicated or contradicted.

**2. Sensory Anchoring**
Every scene opens with physical grounding before interiority:

- Environment first, then character action/thought
- Sensory details specific and metaphorically weighted

**3. Loaded Gestures**
Physical actions carry psychological/spiritual significance:

- Small movements encoded with meaning
- The prose may gloss what the gesture signifies, but subtly

**4. Environmental Metaphor**
Setting elements mirror or comment on action:

- Weather, light, space reflect emotional/spiritual states
- Persistent but not heavy-handed

**5. Parallel Construction**
Mirrored phrases for balance and thematic opposition:

- Used for philosophical content
- Used to contrast states or characters
- Creates incantatory rhythm in spiritual moments

### Sentence-Level

- Favor compound sentences with pivot points (setup, then turn)
- Deliberate fragments for emphasis, especially in pairs/triads
- Speech acts accompanied by physical action or vocal quality
- Dialogue tags often omitted when action makes speaker clear

### Forbidden Patterns

1. **No filter verbs without purpose** — “he saw,” “she felt” only when perception itself matters
1. **No unearned interiority** — thoughts are brief, observed, not pages of monologue
1. **No dialogue without action** — speech is embodied
1. **No setting without meaning** — every environmental detail carries weight
1. **No single-register dialogue** — characters shift speech based on context/power
1. **No simple statements** — complicate with second clause or observation

### Soul Continuity

When drafting any avatar, subtly include:

- **Physical marker**: [TBD - consistent across lives]
- **Behavioral marker**: Patience and observation (Ka watches. Learns. → Silas's academic temperament)
- **Situational marker**: Drawn to certain types of situations/people

The compulsive helping flaw manifests differently in each life but is always present.

### Lilith's Unchanging Face (locked 2025-12-06)

- Sharp widow's peak, single thick darker strand always escaping to the left
- Left eye: deep brown with pale-green crescent 11–1 o'clock (light-dependent; appears completely black in shadow)
- First direct appearance: Chapter 8 (Marcia). Earlier chapters may only hint (shadow, partial glimpse, etc.).

-----

## Dialogue Dynamics

### Register as Power

- When Lilith shifts to clinical language → she’s retreating/deflecting
- When Silas quotes philosophy → he’s asserting/grounding
- Professional jargon = armor
- Intimate probing = manipulation or genuine connection (ambiguous)

### Conversation Modes

1. **Playful banter** — surface intimacy, fencing
1. **Professional distance** — psychiatric/philosophical terminology
1. **Intimate probing** — direct questions about spiritual state
1. **Philosophical sparring** — ideas as weapons

## Genre Modulations

The core patterns persist. Surface elements adjust:

|Cosmic/Transcendent    |23-26                                    |Perspectives may merge; “I” becomes unstable                            |

### What Must Persist Regardless of Genre

1. The undermining clause — duality in every observation
1. Sensory anchoring — environment before interiority
1. Loaded gestures — physical action carrying meaning
1. Parallel construction — especially for thematic content
1. Register shifts in dialogue — power dynamics through language
1. Environmental metaphor — setting reflecting state

## Lilith’s Consistent Appearance

She appears with the same face across all incarnations:

- Dark hair
- [TBD: specific eye color, distinguishing feature]
- [TBD: characteristic gesture]

Readers should recognize her before the avatar does. Her appearances often coincide with moments of crisis or decision.

## Voice Samples

### Opening a scene:

> “The sunset painted warning colors across Lilith’s skin as she sat on the edge of the bed, her silhouette a dark promise against the dying light.”

### Moment of insight:

> “A wave of release washed over Silas. A weight he didn’t know he had been carrying suddenly vanished, a profound peace almost lifting him from the ground.”

### Character observation with complication:

> “The apprehension in her eyes wasn’t apparent. To Silas it was an expectant look, as if she was wondering if the meditation technique was working. His affirmation slipped as something else betrayed itself in her gaze.”

### Dialogue with embedded action:

> “‘I have a new practice for you, to complement your mantra.’ The smile was back, her eyes bright in the way they were when they had first met. A single drop of rain from the sky hit her cheek, glistening as it rolled down.”

### Lilith chapter demonstration technique:

> “Her patient was describing his rivalry with a colleague. ‘I’ve been working toward this promotion for years,’ he said. ‘But if Thompson gets it instead of me, what was the point?’
> 
> Lilith kept her voice gentle. ‘The work wasn’t for the promotion. The work was the growth you experienced doing it.’
> 
> After he left, Lilith returned to her desk, pulled out her notebooks.
> 
> Her hands were shaking.”
