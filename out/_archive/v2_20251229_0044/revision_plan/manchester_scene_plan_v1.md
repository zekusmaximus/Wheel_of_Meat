## I. "Falling in Love" Scenes

The editor notes: "We're told they had dinner at The Walnut, wine at her flat, bedroom confessions. We never see these scenes."

### Scene FL-1: The Walnut Restaurant (First Real Date)

**Setting:** The Walnut Persian Restaurant, Manchester, evening. Warm lighting, Persian decor, the smell of saffron and grilled meat. Early in their relationship, perhaps 2-3 weeks after meeting.

**Beat List:**
1. **Arrival:** Silas nervous, straightening his tweed; Lilith already seated, composed, watching
2. **First vulnerability:** Silas orders in hesitant Farsi; Lilith impressed but doesn't show it
3. **Philosophical sparring:** Debate over consciousness—Silas the idealist, Lilith the materialist
4. **Crack in Lilith's armor:** She mentions "a long time ago" in a way that hints at more
5. **Physical attraction:** Their hands touch reaching for bread; neither pulls away
6. **Silas's want:** He realizes he wants to know her secrets, not just her arguments
7. **Exit:** Walking out into Manchester night, both changed, neither acknowledging it

**Emotional Purpose:**
- Establish Silas as someone who desires, not just observes
- Show Lilith's manipulation as not entirely false—genuine connection beneath the strategy
- Plant seed of her "long time" secret for later payoff
- Give reader investment in the relationship before it's revealed as engineered

**Target Word Count:** 2,000-2,500 words

---

### Scene FL-2: Lilith's Flat, Wine (Intimacy Develops)

**Setting:** Lilith's flat, late evening. Minimalist modern furniture, one wall of books, a window overlooking the university. Wine open. Two weeks after The Walnut.

**Beat List:**
1. **Comfort established:** They've developed routines—she opens the wine, he finds his spot
2. **Philosophical pillow talk:** Discussion of identity and continuity of self
3. **Lilith's slip:** She references something from "before I was born" then covers
4. **Silas's attraction to mystery:** He's drawn in, not repelled, by her strangeness
5. **Physical intimacy:** First real kiss, initiated by Silas (agency)
6. **Post-kiss silence:** Lilith looks at him with something like fear—genuine vulnerability
7. **Her deflection:** She turns conversation back to philosophy, but something has shifted

**Emotional Purpose:**
- Show Silas as the pursuer, not the pursued—he has desire and acts on it
- Demonstrate Lilith's genuine conflict between mission and feeling
- Deepen mystery for reader—what is she hiding?
- Establish physical/emotional intimacy before later betrayal

**Target Word Count:** 2,500-3,000 words

---

### Scene FL-3: Campus Walk, Morning Routine

**Setting:** University of Manchester campus, early morning. Autumn leaves, students beginning to fill paths, coffee in hand. A month into the relationship.

**Beat List:**
1. **Domesticity:** They walk together naturally now, finishing each other's thoughts
2. **Professional intersection:** Discussion of a difficult student (Stewart foreshadowing?)
3. **Silas's contentment:** He realizes he's happy—and this surprises him
4. **Lilith's wistfulness:** She looks at him like someone memorizing a face
5. **Small conflict:** Disagreement about how to handle the student—reveals their different values
6. **Reconciliation:** They agree to disagree; Silas finds this intimacy novel
7. **Parting:** Each to their building, with a small gesture of connection

**Emotional Purpose:**
- Show relationship as established, comfortable, real
- Create investment in "ordinary life" that awakening will threaten
- Foreshadow Stewart crisis
- Give Silas a visible want: this life, this routine, this person

**Target Word Count:** 1,500-2,000 words

---

## II. Stewart Resolution Scenes

The editor notes: "He falls from the rooftop (ambiguously), then essentially disappears from the narrative."

### Scene SR-1: Hospital Visit

**Setting:** North Manchester General Hospital, psychiatric ward. Fluorescent lights, sterile smell, the hum of machines. Three days after the rooftop.

**Beat List:**
1. **Approach:** Silas hesitates at the ward entrance—guilt, uncertainty about his role
2. **Permission:** He's allowed in as "the professor who helped"—ironic given his doubt
3. **First sight of Stewart:** Young man sedated, diminished, nothing like the screaming prophet
4. **Conversation attempt:** Stewart wakes, recognizes Silas, asks "Did you see it too?"
5. **Silas's honesty:** He admits he saw something—first time voicing his experience
6. **Stewart's fear:** "I don't want to see it again. It was too empty."
7. **Silas's teaching impulse:** He wants to explain, to contextualize, but holds back
8. **Lilith appears:** She's been monitoring Stewart; tension between her and Silas
9. **Departure:** Silas leaves with more questions than answers

**Emotional Purpose:**
- Show Silas confronting the consequence of his teaching
- Dramatize the difference between his experience (liberation) and Stewart's (terror)
- Create guilt that gives weight to Silas's journey
- Tension between Silas and Lilith over Stewart's care

**Target Word Count:** 2,000-2,500 words

---

### Scene SR-2: Stewart's Recovery/Departure

**Setting:** University counseling center, then campus exit. Two weeks after rooftop. Stewart is leaving university.

**Beat List:**
1. **Final meeting:** Stewart has decided to take medical leave
2. **Clarity:** Stewart is medicated, stable, but fundamentally changed
3. **Gratitude and accusation:** Stewart thanks Silas for catching him, blames him for what he saw
4. **Silas's responsibility:** He accepts the blame without defending himself
5. **Stewart's insight:** "You're different too. I can tell. What happened to you?"
6. **Silas's deflection:** He claims it was just shock, stress—first lie to himself
7. **Parting:** Stewart leaves; Silas watches from window
8. **Silas alone:** He repeats his mantra but it sounds hollow—"I am boundless awareness"

**Emotional Purpose:**
- Resolve Stewart's arc explicitly
- Show cost of awakening—Stewart's life derailed
- Force Silas to confront his own experience
- Set up Silas's later denial/resistance

**Target Word Count:** 1,500-2,000 words

---

## III. Silas Resistance/Clinging Scenes

The editor notes: "Show him suppressing visions. Show him clinging to normalcy."

### Scene RC-1: Ellen Therapy Session

**Setting:** Ellen's office, university counseling services. Warm, neutral decor. A week after Stewart crisis.

**Beat List:**
1. **Lilith's referral:** Silas is there because Lilith insisted—she's managing him
2. **Ellen's competence:** She's a good therapist; she sees something's off
3. **Silas's deflection:** He discusses Stewart, avoiding his own experience
4. **Ellen's probe:** "But what about you, Silas? What did you see?"
5. **First admission:** Silas mentions "flashes" but frames them as stress
6. **Ellen's interpretation:** "Dissociation under trauma. Very common."
7. **Silas's relief:** He embraces the clinical explanation—a way to dismiss
8. **Lilith's influence:** Ellen recommends the meditation technique Lilith taught
9. **Silas's compliance:** He agrees to "ground himself"—ironic given the technique's true purpose
10. **Exit:** Silas leaves feeling contained, controlled, normal—but wrong

**Emotional Purpose:**
- Show Silas actively choosing denial
- Demonstrate Lilith's network of control (Ellen as unwitting accomplice)
- Create dramatic irony: reader knows what Silas is suppressing
- Give Silas a visible want: to be normal, to be "Professor Pahlavan"

**Target Word Count:** 2,000-2,500 words

---

### Scene RC-2: After First Major Flashback

**Setting:** Silas's flat, night. He's woken from a vision—Chandra's life bleeding through.

**Beat List:**
1. **Waking terror:** Silas bolts upright, tasting blood (echoing Ka chapter)
2. **Physical grounding:** He touches his face, counts fingers—reality check
3. **Memory intrusion:** Fragments of Mauryan court, Devaka's face, the smell of incense
4. **Rejection:** He refuses to accept it—"Just a dream. Brain processing stress."
5. **Mantra as weapon:** "I am boundless awareness"—used to suppress, not expand
6. **Phone call:** He calls Lilith; her voice calms him
7. **Her advice:** More meditation, more grounding—she's feeding the suppression
8. **Morning light:** He watches sunrise, successfully having pushed the vision down
9. **Cost shown:** He looks at himself in mirror—something haunted in his eyes

**Emotional Purpose:**
- Show Silas actively fighting awakening
- Demonstrate the cost of resistance (haunted quality)
- Show Lilith's techniques working as intended—keeping him bound
- Give reader sympathy for a protagonist who struggles

**Target Word Count:** 1,500-2,000 words
