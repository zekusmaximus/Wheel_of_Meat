## Session Log

### Session 1 - [DATE]
**Work Done:**
- Initialized repository structure
- Created scene-manifest.json with all 16 chapters outlined
- Created soul-constants.json with fetter/perfection tracking
- Created lilith-arc.json with power progression
- Created thematic-echoes.md template
- Created reference templates and agent prompts

**Decisions Made:**
- Using incarnation-based folder structure (one folder per chapter/life)
- Each chapter gets its own period-rules.md for genre/historical constraints
- Agent will work one scene at a time within each chapter

**Outstanding Issues:**
- 8 avatars need naming and development (Chapters 4-11)
- Lilith's true motivation needs resolution
- Recognition markers for soul continuity need definition
- Thematic echo map needs completion

**Next Session Should:**
1. Develop the unnamed avatars (names, occupations, specific circumstances)
2. Resolve Lilith's nature and motivation
3. Define recognition markers

## Key Unresolved Questions

1. **Lilith's Nature**: What is she? Options discussed: rival soul, cosmic force, aspect of Silas, something else?

2. **Recognition Markers**: What subtle physical/behavioral/situational markers let readers recognize the same soul across lives?

3. **Frame Structure**: How do Chapters 1 and 12 connect narratively? Does Ch 1 end with Lilith initiating the journey? Time gap to Ch 12?

4. **Genre Execution**: How much should each chapter commit to genre conventions vs. maintain novel unity?

5. **Lilith's Presence in Past**: Does she appear as the same person across lives, or different people? Does Silas recognize her?
