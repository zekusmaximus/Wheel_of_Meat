## Project Status: DEVELOPMENT PHASE

Current focus: Building agent infrastructure and completing chapter development before drafting begins.

## Structural Change Log

### Major Revision: 16 → 26 Chapter Structure

**Date:** [Current session]

**Change:** Elevated Lilith interludes to full chapters, creating alternating structure in Act II.

**New Structure:**

- Act I (Ch 1): Contemporary Manchester—introduction
- Act II (Ch 2-21): 10 historical + 10 Lilith chapters, alternating
- Act III (Ch 22): Contemporary Manchester—stream-entry
- Act IV (Ch 23-26): Cosmic chapters—full enlightenment

**Rationale:** Gives Lilith equal narrative weight; creates parallel forward momentum in both timelines; makes the alternating rhythm explicit in the formal structure.

**Documents Updated:**

- scene-manifest.json — Complete restructure
- CLAUDE.md — Updated structure, chapter table, references
- lilith-arc.json — Remapped chapter numbers
- soul-constants.json — Updated chapter references
- thematic-echoes.md — Expanded tables for Lilith chapters
- novel-progress.txt — This update

**New Documents Created:**

- lilith-chapter-manifest.json — Dedicated tracking for 10 Lilith chapters
- contemporary-period-rules.md — Voice/setting for Manchester chapters

## Session Log

### Session 1 - [Initial Date]

**Work Done:**

- Initialized repository structure
- Created scene-manifest.json with all 16 chapters outlined
- Created soul-constants.json with fetter/perfection tracking
- Created lilith-arc.json with power progression
- Created thematic-echoes.md template
- Created reference templates and agent prompts

**Decisions Made:**

- Using incarnation-based folder structure (one folder per chapter/life)
- Each chapter gets its own period-rules.md for genre/historical constraints
- Agent will work one scene at a time within each chapter

### Session 2 - [Current Date]

**Work Done:**

- Drafted Lilith Interlude 1: The Discovery (~4,000 words)
- Restructured novel from 16 to 26 chapters
- Created lilith-chapter-manifest.json
- Created contemporary-period-rules.md
- Revised all core documentation for new structure

**Decisions Made:**

- Lilith interludes elevated to full chapters
- Act II now alternates: Historical → Lilith → Historical → Lilith
- Word target increased from ~120k to ~150k
- Lilith chapters require demonstration scene (she shows mastery of relevant fetter)

**Outstanding Issues:**

- 8 historical avatars need naming and development (Chapters 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20)
- 8 Lilith chapters need full development (Chapters 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19)
- Recognition markers for soul continuity still need definition
- Backfire mechanisms for most historical chapters still TBD
- Patient parallel scenes for Lilith chapters need development

**Next Session Should:**

1. Develop the unnamed avatars (names, occupations, specific circumstances)
1. Define recognition markers
1. Develop patient parallel scenes for Lilith chapters
1. Begin period-rules.md files for historical chapters

-----

### Session 3 - 2025-12-04

**Work Done:**

- Drafted Chapter 6, Scene I: Prologos—The City Before Collapse (~1,450 words)
- Established Athens setting during early Plague years (430 BCE)
- Introduced Philon of Kephissia (physician) and Alexios (assistant)
- Implemented Greek tragedy voice with classical restraint
- Integrated binding memory (physician who refused earlier plague victim)
- Updated scene-manifest.json to track scene progress

**Decisions Made:**

- Recognition markers successfully implemented: observational patience, hesitation before touch, seeing individuals
- Meat/body theme rendered through butcher's stall imagery
- Binding memory establishes Philon's core vow: never to be the physician who abandons
- Alexios characterized as admiring student who will later voice the lesson Philon cannot hear
- Rumors from Piraeus establish subtle tension without breaking tragic restraint

**Continuity Notes:**

- Philon's observational patience echoes Ka's watching-before-acting pattern
- Touch as loaded gesture continues from Ka's deliberation with pack members
- The binding memory establishes the martyrdom impulse that will drive the chapter's tragedy
- Alexios's rationality foreshadows his eventual departure in Episode V

**Next Scene:**

- Scene II: Parodos—The First Breach (~900 words)
- First plague case collapses in Agora
- Philon steps forward when others flee
- Establishes him as "the physician who will not refuse"
- Word count target: 900 words

## Key Unresolved Questions

1. **Recognition Markers**: What subtle physical/behavioral/situational markers let readers recognize the same soul across lives?
1. **Avatar Development**: Names, occupations, and specific circumstances for Chapters 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20
1. **Backfire Mechanisms**: How exactly does each Lilith intervention catalyze growth? (Partially developed for some chapters)
1. **Patient Parallels**: Specific patient/colleague situations for Lilith chapters that mirror her pursuit of Silas
1. **Lilith’s Physical Description**: Specific eye color, distinguishing feature, characteristic gesture for cross-life recognition
1. **Maitreya Foreshadowing**: Specific moments to plant in each chapter (0-2 per chapter)
1. **The Merger Mechanism**: Exactly how do Silas and Lilith merge in Chapter 26?
