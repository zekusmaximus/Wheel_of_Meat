# Novel Progress Log

## Project Status: DEVELOPMENT PHASE

Current focus: Building agent infrastructure and completing chapter development before drafting begins.

## Structural Change Log

### Major Revision: 16 → 26 Chapter Structure

**Date:** [Current session]

**Change:** Elevated Lilith interludes to full chapters, creating alternating structure in Act II.

**New Structure:**

- Act I (Ch 1): Contemporary Manchester—introduction
- Act II (Ch 2-21): 10 historical + 10 Lilith chapters, alternating
- Act III (Ch 22): Contemporary Manchester—stream-entry
- Act IV (Ch 23-26): Cosmic chapters—full enlightenment

**Rationale:** Gives Lilith equal narrative weight; creates parallel forward momentum in both timelines; makes the alternating rhythm explicit in the formal structure.

**Documents Updated:**

- scene-manifest.json — Complete restructure
- CLAUDE.md — Updated structure, chapter table, references
- lilith-arc.json — Remapped chapter numbers
- soul-constants.json — Updated chapter references
- thematic-echoes.md — Expanded tables for Lilith chapters
- novel-progress.txt — This update

**New Documents Created:**

- lilith-chapter-manifest.json — Dedicated tracking for 10 Lilith chapters
- contemporary-period-rules.md — Voice/setting for Manchester chapters

## Session Log

### Session 1 - [Initial Date]

**Work Done:**

- Initialized repository structure
- Created scene-manifest.json with all 16 chapters outlined
- Created soul-constants.json with fetter/perfection tracking
- Created lilith-arc.json with power progression
- Created thematic-echoes.md template
- Created reference templates and agent prompts

**Decisions Made:**

- Using incarnation-based folder structure (one folder per chapter/life)
- Each chapter gets its own period-rules.md for genre/historical constraints
- Agent will work one scene at a time within each chapter

### Session 2 - [Current Date]

**Work Done:**

- Drafted Lilith Interlude 1: The Discovery (~4,000 words)
- Restructured novel from 16 to 26 chapters
- Created lilith-chapter-manifest.json
- Created contemporary-period-rules.md
- Revised all core documentation for new structure

**Decisions Made:**

- Lilith interludes elevated to full chapters
- Act II now alternates: Historical → Lilith → Historical → Lilith
- Word target increased from ~120k to ~150k
- Lilith chapters require demonstration scene (she shows mastery of relevant fetter)

**Outstanding Issues:**

- 8 historical avatars need naming and development (Chapters 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20)
- 8 Lilith chapters need full development (Chapters 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19)
- Recognition markers for soul continuity still need definition
- Backfire mechanisms for most historical chapters still TBD
- Patient parallel scenes for Lilith chapters need development

**Next Session Should:**

1. Develop the unnamed avatars (names, occupations, specific circumstances)
1. Define recognition markers
1. Develop patient parallel scenes for Lilith chapters
1. Begin period-rules.md files for historical chapters

-----

### Session 3 - 2025-12-04

**Work Done:**

- Drafted Chapter 6, Scene I: Prologos—The City Before Collapse (~1,450 words)
- Established Athens setting during early Plague years (430 BCE)
- Introduced Philon of Kephissia (physician) and Alexios (assistant)
- Implemented Greek tragedy voice with classical restraint
- Integrated binding memory (physician who refused earlier plague victim)
- Updated scene-manifest.json to track scene progress

**Decisions Made:**

- Recognition markers successfully implemented: observational patience, hesitation before touch, seeing individuals
- Meat/body theme rendered through butcher's stall imagery
- Binding memory establishes Philon's core vow: never to be the physician who abandons
- Alexios characterized as admiring student who will later voice the lesson Philon cannot hear
- Rumors from Piraeus establish subtle tension without breaking tragic restraint

**Continuity Notes:**

- Philon's observational patience echoes Ka's watching-before-acting pattern
- Touch as loaded gesture continues from Ka's deliberation with pack members
- The binding memory establishes the martyrdom impulse that will drive the chapter's tragedy
- Alexios's rationality foreshadows his eventual departure in Episode V

**Next Scene:**

- Scene II: Parodos—The First Breach (~900 words)
- First plague case collapses in Agora
- Philon steps forward when others flee
- Establishes him as "the physician who will not refuse"
- Word count target: 900 words

-----

### Session 4 - 2025-12-04

**Work Done:**

- Drafted Chapter 6, Scene II: Parodos—The First Breach (~900 words)
- First plague case collapses in the Agora
- Philon steps forward to help when crowd forms "ring of fear"
- Alexios hesitates but follows
- Establishes Philon as "the physician who will not refuse"
- Updated scene-manifest.json to track scene progress

**Decisions Made:**

- Three-day gap between rumors and first collapse preserves pacing
- The "ring of fear" (empty circle around fallen man) serves as visual metaphor for civic abandonment
- Recognition markers present: observational patience, unhurried attention, hesitation before touch
- Meat/body theme rendered through physical symptoms (flushed skin, fever-hot forehead, tremors)
- Alexios's questioning line ("how many lives will this one cost?") plants his eventual departure argument
- The binding memory explicitly echoes ("another man, another doorway")

**Continuity Notes:**

- Scene picks up from Scene 01's ending (Philon standing in doorway, rumors from Piraeus)
- Alexios's wariness established—watching patients for plague signs
- "One life is worth the effort" becomes the defining statement of Philon's ethic
- The "door he swore never to close" imagery connects to binding memory
- Parthenon described as "beautiful and indifferent"—environmental metaphor for tragic inevitability

**Next Scene:**

- Scene III: First Episode—The Flood (~1,500 words)
- Long Walls fill with refugees; clinic overwhelmed
- Lilith's first intervention: xenophobic panic amplified
- Magistrates demand triage by status; Philon refuses
- Alexios begins to crack under pressure
- Meat/body theme: Philon touches diseased flesh others won't

-----

### Session 5 - 2025-12-04

**Work Done:**

- Drafted Chapter 6, Scene III: First Episode—The Flood (~1,550 words)
- Long Walls crowded with refugees fleeing Spartan raids
- Lilith's first intervention lands: xenophobic rumors about Persian ships amplifying chaos
- Magistrate Kallias demands triage by citizen status; Philon refuses
- Alexios shows first fractures: compulsive hand-washing, story of dead boy, flinches from Philon's touch
- Updated scene-manifest.json to track scene progress

**Decisions Made:**

- Kallias (Council of Five Hundred member) introduced as voice of civic authority vs. Philon's universal ethic
- Alexios's crack shown through behavior (compulsive washing, flinching) rather than explicit breakdown
- Lilith's intervention rendered naturalistically—rumors that "spread faster than the illness they pretended to explain"
- Dead boy scene plants Alexios's eventual departure argument: triage as rational, not cowardly
- "Physician's oath does not distinguish between the blood of a citizen and the blood of a slave" as Philon's defining moral stance

**Continuity Notes:**

- Scene picks up "a fortnight" after Scene 02's first plague case
- Alexios's wariness from Scene 02 has evolved into visible psychological strain
- Philon's observational patience maintained ("Philon watched him, as he watched everyone")
- Environmental metaphor: funeral pyres as "orange smears," smoke settling "like a shroud"
- Meat/body thread: pustules, fluids, hands that "carry death"

**Next Scene:**

- Scene IV: First Stasimon—The City's Lament (~500 words)
- Funeral pyres visible day and night
- Citizens abandon rites, hurl corpses onto fires
- Civic order dissolving
- Atmospheric—Philon not present; city as chorus
- Meat/body: Burning flesh of funeral pyres

-----

### Session 6 - 2025-12-04

**Work Done:**

- Drafted Chapter 6, Scene IV: First Stasimon—The City's Lament (~510 words)
- Choral interlude showing Athens's collapse without Philon POV
- Funeral pyres burning day and night; citizens abandoning proper burial rites
- Civic institutions dissolving (courts closed, Assembly abandoned, philosophers fled)
- Parthenon as environmental metaphor for divine indifference
- Updated scene-manifest.json to track scene progress

**Decisions Made:**

- Used omniscient/choral POV as befits Greek tragic stasimon structure
- Structured lament around progressive breakdown: rites first, then bodies as obstacles, then fire as only recourse
- Parthenon's beauty contrasted with city's horror creates undermining tension
- Brief Philon reference at end ("somewhere in the city, a physician worked on") maintains narrative thread
- Meat/body theme rendered through "greasy smoke," burning flesh smell, bodies as landscape features

**Continuity Notes:**

- Scene picks up pyre imagery from Scene 03's closing lines
- Coin for Charon, washing of body, lamentations—all historically accurate burial customs
- No anachronisms: agora, Acropolis, Athena, Assembly, Parthenon all appropriate
- Divine indifference theme echoes Ka chapter's cosmos indifferent to individual striving
- Choral mode prepares reader for return to Philon's individual struggle in Scene V

**Next Scene:**

- Scene VI: Second Stasimon—The Cost of the Choice (~500 words)
- Pericles glimpsed in passing (image of man who cannot save what he loves)
- Smell of unburied dead permeating city
- Philon's first flicker of doubt—suppressed immediately
- Atmospheric deepening of tragedy

-----

### Session 7 - 2025-12-04

**Work Done:**

- Drafted Chapter 6, Scene V: Second Episode—The Impossible Choice (~1,680 words)
- Magistrate Kallias orders Philon to relocate to Eleusis to serve the wealthy; Philon refuses
- Alexios confronts Philon with the rational argument: "If we both die, who treats the hundred?"
- Slave woman from Scythia arrives—abandoned by owners, dying at the gate
- Alexios's departure: painful, not villainous—he voices the lesson Philon cannot hear
- Philon carries the woman toward his clinic, choosing one life over the many
- Updated scene-manifest.json to track scene progress

**Decisions Made:**

- Lilith's dream-influence on Alexios rendered naturalistically: "Something had changed in the night. Something Philon could not name."
- Alexios's departure framed as rational love, not cowardice—he makes the Stoic argument Philon's next incarnation will embrace
- The slave woman remains unnamed throughout (Philon never learns her name—this is thematically important)
- Her single word "Why?" crystallizes the unanswerable nature of his choice
- Binding memory echoes: "He could not become that man" (the physician who closed his door)
- Kallias introduced as voice of civic pragmatism: "You serve the polis, physician—not your own conscience"

**Continuity Notes:**

- Scene picks up from Scene 04's closing line: "somewhere in the city, a physician worked on"
- Alexios's psychological fractures from Scene 03 have reached breaking point
- The shaking hands established in Scene 03 persist: "his hands trembling at his sides"
- Philon's observational patience maintained: "studied his assistant's face" before speaking
- Touch as loaded gesture: "close enough to touch, not touching" before the confrontation
- Environmental metaphor: smoke, pyres, the gate as threshold between living and dying
- The woman's Scythian origin established; her broken Greek confirms foreign status

**Next Scene:**

- Scene VII: Third Episode—Martyrdom (~1,500 words)
- Philon isolates himself with slave woman
- Last-ditch care: cooling cloths, water, whispered reassurances
- She speaks—crystallizes tragedy (gratitude? question about why?)
- She dies in his arms
- Philon's first cough
- Point of no return marked clearly

-----

### Session 8 - 2025-12-04

**Work Done:**

- Drafted Chapter 6, Scene VI: Second Stasimon—The Cost of the Choice (~520 words)
- Atmospheric interlude showing Athens's continued collapse
- Pericles glimpsed in litter passing through Agora—parallel to Philon as man who cannot save what he loves
- Philon's first flicker of doubt surfaces and is suppressed
- Updated scene-manifest.json to track scene progress

**Decisions Made:**

- Pericles rendered as ghostly presence rather than speaking character—maintains "background only" requirement
- Stasimon structured in two parts: omniscient city view, then return to Philon's POV for doubt sequence
- Doubt framed as "arithmetic"—echoing Alexios's rational argument from Scene 05
- Doubt suppressed but not defeated: "a wound sutured shut without healing"
- Smell of unburied dead rendered as a presence, not just a sensory detail

**Continuity Notes:**

- Scene picks up from Scene 05's closing: Philon carrying the woman toward his clinic
- The woman's "Water" request echoes her earlier "Why?"—showing diminished capacity
- Philon's care (cloth, water) continues the tactile physician thread
- Pericles's hollow frame mirrors the city's hollowing—environmental metaphor maintained
- Smoke and pyres imagery continues from previous scenes

**Next Scene:**

- Scene VII: Third Episode—Martyrdom (~1,500 words)
- Philon isolates himself with slave woman
- Last-ditch care: cooling cloths, water, whispered reassurances
- She speaks—crystallizes tragedy (gratitude? question about why?)
- She dies in his arms
- Philon's first cough
- Point of no return marked clearly

-----

### Session 9 - 2025-12-04

**Work Done:**

- Drafted Chapter 6, Scene VII: Third Episode—Martyrdom (~1,520 words)
- Philon keeps vigil through the night with the Scythian woman
- She wakes and asks the crystallizing question: "Why waste on one slave?"
- He answers with presence and touch—the only response he knows
- She dies three hours before dawn; he performs last rites alone
- Philon coughs—point of no return established
- Updated scene-manifest.json to track scene progress

**Decisions Made:**

- The woman's question "Why waste on one slave?" crystallizes the tragedy—she has internalized her owners' valuation of her
- Philon's answer ("You are not a waste") is an act of defiance against the utilitarian calculus
- She dies without telling him her name; he never asks—thematically important that her identity is complete without external markers
- The cough arrives after her death, not during—his infection is consequence of his choice, not coincidental
- Dawn light returns the scene to the living, transitioning toward final scenes

**Continuity Notes:**

- Scene picks up from Scene 06's closing: Philon in small room, woman on last clean pallet
- The "arithmetic" doubt from Scene 06 is referenced obliquely ("the numbers did not heal")
- Binding memory echoes: "the hand that had refused to close a door"
- Tactile physician thread continues: cloth, water, holding her hand, closing her eyes
- Environmental metaphor: lamp guttering out as she dies, dawn light returning
- Meat/body theme: pustules spreading, skin mottling, the physical reality of plague death

**Next Scene:**

- Scene VIII: Kommos—The Broken Realization (~1,000 words)
- Fever delirium intercut with city's collapse
- Visceral insight: "If I had lived, I could have saved a hundred. I chose one. Was the one for them—or for me?"
- Incomplete understanding—arising from pain, not clarity
- Too late to change anything

## Key Unresolved Questions

1. **Recognition Markers**: What subtle physical/behavioral/situational markers let readers recognize the same soul across lives?
1. **Avatar Development**: Names, occupations, and specific circumstances for Chapters 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20
1. **Backfire Mechanisms**: How exactly does each Lilith intervention catalyze growth? (Partially developed for some chapters)
1. **Patient Parallels**: Specific patient/colleague situations for Lilith chapters that mirror her pursuit of Silas
1. **Lilith’s Physical Description**: Specific eye color, distinguishing feature, characteristic gesture for cross-life recognition
1. **Maitreya Foreshadowing**: Specific moments to plant in each chapter (0-2 per chapter)
1. **The Merger Mechanism**: Exactly how do Silas and Lilith merge in Chapter 26?
