## Structural Notes

### Pacing Considerations

1. **Part I (35.5%)** — Establishes Manchester + Ka origin + first historical incarnation
   - Heavy Manchester presence at start creates reader investment
   - Chandra demonstrates the core pattern clearly

2. **Part II (18.5%)** — Accelerated historical survey
   - Four tracking fragments replace full incarnations
   - Diego provides strongest historical horror
   - Renaissance introduces skepticism theme

3. **Part III (10.9%)** — Tighter spiral toward convergence
   - Taiping and Malone in compressed form
   - Lilith's tracking intensifies
   - Builds momentum toward breakthrough

4. **Part IV (35.2%)** — Manchester return + metaphysical climax
   - Mirror weight of Part I
   - Breakthrough anchored in Manchester
   - Compressed but complete metaphysical sequence

### Renumbering Logic

Original 26 chapters → New 22 chapters
- Chapters 1–5 preserved with original numbers
- Cut chapters (6, 8, 10, 12) removed entirely
- Tracking fragments (original 7, 9, 11, 13) become new 6–9
- Remaining chapters renumbered consecutively

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Loss of thematic depth from cuts
**Mitigation**: Tracking fragments explicitly reference cut incarnations' lessons, maintaining thematic continuity without full dramatization.

### Risk: Manchester expansion feels padded
**Mitigation**: New scenes dramatize relationship development (currently told in summary) rather than adding new plot. Editor explicitly requests this content.

### Risk: Final sequence too compressed
**Mitigation**: Combine formless realm stages as editor suggests; focus on essential transformation moments.

### Risk: Lilith tracking fragments feel vestigial
**Mitigation**: Reframe as Lilith's accelerating obsession; compressed length mirrors her loss of perspective.
