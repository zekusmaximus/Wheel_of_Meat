## II. Abstraction Density Ranking

### Top 10 Chapters by Abstraction Density

Abstraction density = (abstract nouns - sensory verbs) / total words × 1000
Higher = more abstract prose, needs grounding

| Rank | Ch | Name | Density | Primary Issue |
|------|-----|------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | 25 | Formless Realms | 13.72 | Intentionally abstract but reader fatigue risk |
| 2 | 23 | Deva Celestial | 11.01 | Metaphysical content needs sensory anchoring |
| 3 | 24 | Future Prophet | 9.48 | Post-human setting lacks physical grounding |
| 4 | 13 | Lilith CP06 | 5.53 | Reflection dominates action |
| 5 | 26 | Pure Abodes | 5.06 | Climax abstraction appropriate but watch balance |
| 6 | 19 | Lilith CP09 | 4.69 | Heavy reflection before awakening |
| 7 | 11 | Lilith CP05 | 2.05 | Moderate abstraction |
| 8 | 17 | Lilith CP08 | 0.85 | Near balance |
| 9 | 14 | Diego/Inquisition | -0.11 | Good sensory balance |
| 10 | 10 | Macarius/Egypt | -0.22 | Good sensory balance |

### Best Models for Grounded Prose

| Rank | Ch | Name | Density | Why It Works |
|------|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | 2 | Ka/Prehistoric | -31.63 | Body-first, zero abstraction |
| 2 | 7 | Lilith CP03 | -10.56 | Active observation, physical detail |
| 3 | 15 | Lilith CP07 | -10.19 | Movement and action |
| 4 | 18 | Taiping Rebel | -9.21 | Conflict-driven, sensory |
| 5 | 12 | Kaoru/Heian | -8.27 | Aesthetic sensibility, physical beauty |

## III. Specific Tic Analysis

### A. "Particular" (88 occurrences)

**Distribution:**
- Ch 4 (Chandra): 22 occurrences — highest
- Ch 14 (Diego): 10 occurrences
- Ch 26 (Pure Abodes): 9 occurrences
- Ch 7 (Lilith CP03): 9 occurrences
- Ch 24 (Future): 8 occurrences

**Pattern Examples:**

| Current | Problem | Revision Strategy |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| "this particular moment" | Filler; "moment" sufficient | "this moment" |
| "her particular way of" | Vague intensifier | "her way of" or specify the way |
| "the particular quality of" | Delays meaning | Name the quality directly |
| "in that particular life" | Redundant with context | "in that life" or cut entirely |

**Reduction Target:** 88 → 44 (cut 44 occurrences)

**Priority Chapters:** Ch 4, Ch 14, Ch 26, Ch 7

---

### B. "Something" (931 occurrences)

**Distribution:**
- Ch 25 (Formless): 125 occurrences — highest
- Ch 10 (Macarius): 78 occurrences
- Ch 26 (Pure Abodes): 74 occurrences
- Ch 12 (Kaoru): 62 occurrences
- Ch 24 (Future): 60 occurrences

**Pattern Examples:**

| Current | Problem | Revision Strategy |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| "something shifted in her" | Vague; what shifted? | Name the shift: "her resolve wavered" |
| "something like fear" | Hedging | "fear, or something close to it" OR commit: "fear" |
| "he felt something" | Empty | Describe the sensation |
| "there was something in" | Delay tactic | Direct statement |
| "something about the way" | Double vagueness | Name the thing and the way |

**Reduction Target:** 931 → 465 (cut 466 occurrences)

**Priority Chapters:** Ch 25, Ch 10, Ch 26, Ch 12, Ch 24

**Note:** Ch 25 (Formless Realms) uses "something" deliberately for the ineffable. Reduce by ~50 (to 75), but preserve intentional uses.

---

### C. "Not [X]—[Y]" Pattern (104 occurrences)

**Distribution:**
- Ch 26 (Pure Abodes): 24 occurrences — highest
- Ch 22 (Contemporary Break): 11 occurrences
- Ch 24 (Future): 11 occurrences
- Ch 25 (Formless): 11 occurrences
- Ch 12 (Kaoru): 9 occurrences

**Pattern Examples:**

| Current | Problem | Revision Strategy |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| "not fear—recognition" | Overused; mannerism | "recognition, not fear" |
| "not anger—something older" | Doubles with "something" | Name it directly |
| "not gone—transformed" | Can become full sentences | "She wasn't gone. She was transformed." |
| "not pain—release" | Philosophical crutch | Describe the sensation instead |

**Reduction Target:** 104 → 52 (cut 52 occurrences)

**Priority Chapters:** Ch 26, Ch 22, Ch 24, Ch 25

**Method:** Convert 50% to either:
1. Full sentences: "It wasn't fear. It was recognition."
2. Positive statement: "Recognition flooded through her."
3. Simple comma: "Recognition, not fear, flooded through her."

### D. Em-Dashes (2,857 occurrences)

**Distribution (top 10):**
- Ch 25 (Formless): 294 — highest
- Ch 14 (Diego): 230
- Ch 26 (Pure Abodes): 200
- Ch 10 (Macarius): 169
- Ch 4 (Chandra): 167
- Ch 12 (Kaoru): 152
- Ch 24 (Future): 141
- Ch 22 (Contemporary): 129
- Ch 19 (Lilith CP09): 128
- Ch 8 (Verinus): 123

**Em-dash density** (dashes per 1,000 words):

| Ch | Words | Dashes | Density |
|----|-------|--------|---------|
| 25 | 11,880 | 294 | 24.7 |
| 26 | 10,464 | 200 | 19.1 |
| 21 | 3,738 | 94 | 25.1 |
| 22 | 9,748 | 129 | 13.2 |
| 14 | 18,641 | 230 | 12.3 |

**Pattern Problems:**

1. **Interruptive asides:** "The consciousness—if it could be called that—expanded..."
2. **Dramatic pauses:** "And then—nothing."
3. **Appositive overuse:** "Lilith—the one who had watched—saw..."
4. **List-breaking:** "Fear—anger—grief—all of it dissolving..."

**Reduction Strategy:**

| Current Pattern | Replace With |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Interruptive aside (—X—) | Commas or parentheses for 50% |
| Dramatic pause (—) | Period for new sentence |
| Appositive (—X—) | Commas |
| List-breaking | Commas or semicolons |

**Target:** No paragraph should have >2 em-dashes. Reduce total by ~30%.

## V. Mechanical Checklist for Line-Edit Pass

### Phase 1: Search-and-Evaluate

For each chapter, run these searches:

```
SEARCH: "particular"
EVALUATE: Is this word necessary? Does it add meaning beyond the noun it modifies?
KEEP IF: Genuinely distinguishing this instance from others
CUT IF: Filler, intensifier, or delay tactic
```

```
SEARCH: "something"
EVALUATE: Can the "something" be named?
KEEP IF: Intentionally preserving ambiguity, or character doesn't know
CUT IF: Author-level vagueness that could be specified
```

```
SEARCH: "not" followed by em-dash within 10 words
EVALUATE: Is the contrast better served by another construction?
KEEP IF: Rhythm genuinely requires the pivot
CONVERT IF: Can be full sentence, comma construction, or positive statement
```

```
SEARCH: em-dash (—)
EVALUATE: Does this paragraph have >2? Is the em-dash doing work that punctuation can't?
KEEP IF: Genuine interruption or dramatic pause earns its weight
CONVERT IF: Comma, semicolon, or period serves as well
```

### Phase 2: Abstraction Grounding

For high-abstraction chapters (23, 24, 25, 26):

1. **Find philosophical passages** (3+ sentences of reflection)
2. **Anchor to physical detail:** Add one sensory element per passage
   - What does the body feel? (temperature, texture, weight)
   - What does the environment smell/sound like?
   - What object is present in the scene?

3. **Ka-register moments:** Insert 1-2 brief body-first sentences per chapter
   - Example (current): "Consciousness expanded into formlessness."
   - Example (revised): "The body still breathed. In, out. The ribs expanded, contracted. Consciousness expanded into formlessness."

### Phase 3: Reflective Elaboration Cuts

**Target:** 30-40% reduction in reflective/commentary paragraphs

**Identify reflective elaboration:**
- Paragraphs that explain what just happened
- "This meant that..." or "What this revealed was..."
- Passages that repeat in different words what the scene already showed

**Cut criteria:**
1. Scene already demonstrated the point → cut the explanation
2. Character's reaction visible in action → cut interior gloss
3. Same idea stated in previous paragraph → cut the repetition

**Preservation criteria:**
1. New information introduced → keep
2. Emotional nuance scene couldn't show → keep
3. Philosophical content that IS the novel's subject → keep (but ground it)

## VI. Sample Revisions

### Example 1: "Something" Reduction

**Before (Ch 25):**
> Something was happening in the space between thoughts—something that couldn't be captured in the framework of something happening to someone.

**After:**
> A shift occurred in the space between thoughts—a movement that couldn't be captured in any framework of event and experiencer.

**Analysis:** Removed 3 "something" occurrences. Named the abstract: "shift," "movement."

---

### Example 2: Em-Dash Reduction

**Before (Ch 26):**
> The fetter—if it could be called a fetter—wasn't something she could release—it was something she could only see—and seeing was releasing.

**After:**
> The fetter, if it could be called that, wasn't something she could release. It was something she could only see. And seeing was releasing.

**Analysis:** Reduced 4 em-dashes to 0. Split into sentences. Rhythm preserved through short sentences.

---

### Example 3: Not-X-Y Pattern Conversion

**Before (Ch 26):**
> Not fear—recognition. Not resistance—release. Not two—one.

**After:**
> Recognition flooded through her, where fear had been. Release replaced resistance. Two dissolved into one.

**Analysis:** Converted 3 not-x-y patterns to positive statements. More active, less mannerism.

---

### Example 4: Abstraction Grounding

**Before (Ch 25):**
> Consciousness recognized itself as consciousness recognizing itself, the loop tightening toward a singularity where observer and observed could no longer be distinguished.

**After:**
> Consciousness recognized itself as consciousness recognizing itself. The body still sat beneath the tree; bark pressed into the back, root-knobs under thighs. But the sitting body was observed, and the observing was observed, the loop tightening toward a singularity where observer and observed could no longer be distinguished.

**Analysis:** Added physical anchoring (tree, bark, root-knobs) without losing philosophical content.
