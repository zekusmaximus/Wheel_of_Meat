The flat had accumulated in the months since Ka's discovery.

Not dramatically—Lilith was not someone whose spaces became disordered. But the evidence of her pursuit had begun to leave traces: a second notebook on the side table beside the perpetually cold tea, a small stack of photocopied texts on consciousness and perception, a map of ancient Mauryan trade routes tacked to the wall near her practice corner. Nothing that would alarm a visitor. Everything that marked how her private hours had been spent.

She settled into her position as the last daylight faded—crossed legs, spine straight, the lamp's familiar glow reaching just far enough to illuminate the outline of her own stillness. The rain had strengthened, its rhythm against the window providing a baseline that helped the ordinary world recede.

*Chandra.*

She had glimpsed him before, in those first sessions after discovering Ka's thread. The merchant's son who became administrator. The man of ledgers and calculations, who measured suffering in numbers and responses in resource allocation. She had seen enough to understand the shape of his lesson: giving. Not resources, which he gave freely enough—but himself. His presence. The thing that could not be quantified.

Tonight she would follow the thread further. Watch how it developed. Learn.

Her breath slowed. The room thinned around her, becoming less insistent. The darkness behind her closed eyes expanded into the space where threads hummed at the edge of perception, where patterns could be traced across depths of time that made her own iterations seem recent.

She found Chandra's thread where she had left it: dense, unpolished, still building toward whatever completion his pattern sought. It had changed since Ka—more refined, more sophisticated, carrying the complexity of a mind that worked in systems rather than pure survival. But the core hunger remained. The desperate need to understand giving that had survived Ka's death still pulsed beneath the surface, transformed but not transcended.

She followed.

---

Impressions first, before coherence. Heat—not the cold of Ka's cave but the thick warmth of a monsoon afternoon. The smell of grain and dust and the particular sweetness of incense burning at a temple she could not see. Sound: the low murmur of crowds, the creak of cart wheels, the distant trumpeting of an elephant.

Then the pattern sharpened, and Chandra's consciousness took shape around her like water finding its container.

*Numbers.* The word arrived with visceral force. Numbers were how this mind worked—everything reduced to calculation, to inventory, to the endless ledger-keeping that had replaced the cruder hoarding of Ka's frozen meat. She could feel the satisfaction Chandra took in accounts that balanced, weights that matched, systems that functioned as designed.

But beneath the satisfaction: the same absence she had sensed before. He gave grain. He gave resources. He gave the careful management of systems that fed thousands. What he did not give was himself—his presence, his attention, his willingness to remain with suffering rather than solving it from a distance.

*Still incomplete.* The assessment formed without conscious decision. The shift from Ka's pure hoarding to Chandra's systematic distribution represented genuine development. But the core lesson remained unlearned. He still held himself separate. He still calculated when he should have simply stayed.

She traced further into his timeline, seeking the moments of crisis that shaped any pattern's development. His appointment as Rājuka. The assassination attempt. The investigation that followed—

And there: a thread within the thread. A relationship that vibrated with instability, with tension, with choices not yet made.

*Devaka.*

The name surfaced from Chandra's consciousness, carrying fifteen years of partnership. She could feel what Devaka meant to him: the closest thing to trust this calculating mind allowed itself, the one relationship that existed outside the ledger's cold arithmetic. Chandra did not think of Devaka as friend—the word would have felt imprecise—but something in his pattern leaned toward this man in ways he had never leaned toward anyone.

Lilith observed the bond between them. The shared history. The instinct that had survived decades. And she observed something else: the pressure on that bond, invisible to Chandra but visible to her from this distance. Devaka existed in tension—loyalty pulling against something darker, against fear, against the shadow of compromises Chandra knew nothing about.

The thread connecting them hummed with unresolved choice. Devaka could go either way. The pattern had not yet collapsed into certainty.

She leaned closer to observe.

Her attention narrowed on that vibrating tension, trying to understand the mechanics of what she was seeing. How did choice work at this level? What determined which path a thread would take when the branching point arrived? She had observed patterns before, but always retrospectively—watching what had already happened. This was different. This was a choice still forming.

She focused harder. The thread brightened under her attention, its vibrations becoming more distinct. She could almost see the two possibilities—the loyalty that would hold, the betrayal that would break—

The thread *snapped*.

Not literally—nothing broke—but the sensation was exactly that: a tension releasing, a probability collapsing, a choice that had been suspended between outcomes suddenly falling toward one. The fear-thread blazed white. The loyalty-thread guttered and dimmed. And Lilith felt her own attention *inside* the collapse, her observation somehow part of what had caused it, her focus the weight that had tipped a balanced scale.

She wrenched herself backward so violently that the tracking shattered.

One moment she was suspended in ancient Pataliputra. The next she was on her floor in Manchester, and the floor was tilting, and her hands were scrabbling against cold boards, and something was very wrong.

The gradual discomfort of previous sessions returned as she pondered, a wave that doubled her over, her forehead pressed to the floor, her breath coming in ragged gasps.

She had done something.

The knowledge arrived not as thought but as certainty, physical and absolute. She had leaned too close. She had focused too hard. And something in her attention had carried weight it was never meant to carry, had pressed against a choice that was not hers to make, had collapsed a possibility that should have remained open until Devaka himself closed it.

She crawled to the wall and pulled herself upright, her legs refusing to hold her weight. The lamp's dim glow felt like assault. The rain against the window sounded like accusation.

*What have I done?*

The tea on the side table had gone cold hours ago. She drank it anyway, her hands shaking so badly that half of it spilled down her chin, the bitter taste cutting through the fog of physical shock.

Devaka would betray Chandra. She didn't know how she knew this, but she knew it the way she knew her own name—knew that the bond she had observed was already broken, that the choice she had witnessed was made now, that her attention had been the weight that determined an outcome across thousands of years.

She crossed to the window and pressed her forehead against the cold glass. Manchester stretched below, rain-slicked and indifferent. The streetlights blurred through water, orange smears in the darkness.

*You didn't mean to,* she told herself. *You were only watching.*

But she had not been only watching. She had been leaning. Focusing. Pressing her attention against something that was still forming. And the pressing had mattered. The observation had participated in what it observed.

She could do it again.

The thought arrived uninvited, and she could not tell if it was horror or hunger.
