Gerald Ashworth sat with his hands clasped in his lap, fingers interlaced so tightly that the knuckles had gone white. The therapy room's neutral tones—beige walls, gray carpet, the carefully inoffensive art—seemed to press against him from all sides.

"Eight years." His voice carried the hoarse quality of someone who had been explaining himself for too long. "I know how that sounds. But you have to understand—Thompson and I started at the same level. Same year, same cohort, same potential. The differences between us were negligible."

Lilith let the silence stretch. Outside, a bus ground through its gears on Oxford Road, the sound distant and ordinary.

"Then something shifted." Ashworth's hands unclenched, gestured toward nothing. "He started publishing more. Getting the committee assignments. The grants I applied for went to him instead. And I started… noticing."

"The spreadsheets."

"Documentation." The correction came quickly, defensively. "I was documenting a pattern. There had to be an explanation—favoritism, politics, something I could point to and say, 'There. That's why.' If I could find the reason, I could address it."

"And did you find one?"

His hands had returned to their tight clasp. The question hung between them, simple and unanswerable.

"No." The admission came out small. "The numbers just accumulated. Eight years of data, and no pattern except—" He stopped, jaw working.

"Except?"

"Except that he kept succeeding and I kept watching him succeed." Ashworth's eyes met hers for the first time, something raw in them. "I've spent eight years proving that I deserved what he got. Building a case that no one asked for, that no one will ever read, that proves nothing except how much time I've wasted proving it."

Lilith let him sit with that. The radiator clicked and hummed. Somewhere down the corridor, a door closed.

"What would it mean," she said finally, "to stop documenting?"

"I don't—" He shook his head. "I wouldn't know what to do with the time."

"No. I mean what would it mean. Not practically. Emotionally."

The silence that followed was different—heavier, more dangerous. Ashworth's hands had begun to tremble.

"It would mean admitting that it doesn't matter. The spreadsheets, the tracking, all of it. It would mean accepting that his success isn't about me. That I've been measuring myself against someone who never knew we were competing."

Lilith held very still.

"And what would be left," she asked, "if you stopped competing?"

The question opened something in the room—a space that hadn't existed before. Ashworth stared at his white-knuckled hands as if seeing them for the first time.

"I don't know," he said. "Maybe just the work. The actual work, without needing it to mean I'm better than him."

"The work you were doing before you started tracking."

"Before I made it about winning."

Lilith nodded slowly. "Outcomes are external. They're outside your control—always were, always will be. What Thompson achieves says nothing about the value of what you've built. The spreadsheets were trying to prove something that was never provable."

"Because it was never about the data."

"It was about the story you were telling yourself with the data. The story where his success diminished yours." She leaned forward slightly. "What if you could release the comparison and just do the work?"

Ashworth exhaled, a long shuddering breath that seemed to release something more than air. His hands had unclenched. The trembling had stopped.

"I don't know if I can," he said. "Eight years is a long time."

"It is," Lilith agreed. "But you're here. That's a start."

The session ended at the scheduled time. Ashworth shook her hand at the door—his grip steadier than it had been, something in his posture fractionally lighter. He would need months of work to fully untangle what had consumed him. But the first thread had been pulled.

Lilith watched him disappear down the corridor, then returned to the therapy room to write her notes.

*Outcomes are external. Release the comparison. Just do the work.*

Her own words echoed strangely as she documented the session. Good clinical counsel. Sound therapeutic framing. She had helped him see the trap he had built around himself—eight years of meticulous documentation proving nothing except the depth of his own entanglement.

The notebook in her bag pressed against her hip.

She finished her clinical notes, filed them properly, gathered her things. The afternoon had turned darker, rain beginning to spot the windows again. In forty-five minutes she would be home, in her flat, in the corner where the lamp cast its dim circle on the bare floor.

Where her own documentation waited. Her own tracking. Her own meticulous records of a pattern she was following through time.

The thought surfaced and she let it pass, the way she let unwelcome thoughts pass during practice—acknowledged, released, not examined. Gerald's situation was different. Gerald was trapped in comparison, in competition. She was simply observing. Learning. Following a thread that had nothing to do with proving anything about herself.

The rain met her at the door, cold and insistent. She walked toward home with her mind already turning toward the evening's work, toward the thread she would trace, the ancient administrator whose incomplete lessons she had glimpsed in previous sessions.

Her fingers found the notebook's edge through the canvas and pressed against it like a talisman.

She did not notice the gesture. She did not notice that her pace had quickened. She did not notice that she had spent forty-five minutes helping a man release his obsessive tracking, and that she was walking home to continue her own.
