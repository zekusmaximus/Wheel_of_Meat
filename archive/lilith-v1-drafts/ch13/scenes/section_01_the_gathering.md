# Chapter 13, Section I: The Gathering

---

The afternoon light entered Lilith's office at an angle that made her patient squint—a woman in her late forties, hands clasped in her lap with the particular tightness of someone holding herself together. Caroline Webb. Third session. The intake notes mentioned divorce, adult children who had stopped calling, a face she no longer recognised in mirrors.

"I used to be beautiful," Caroline said. The words arrived without self-pity, which made them worse. "Not fishing for compliments. Just—I was. And now I catch my reflection in shop windows and think, who is that? Where did the other one go?"

Lilith let the silence hold. Outside, a door closed somewhere down the corridor.

"What would it mean," she asked, "if the other one isn't coming back?"

Caroline's hands tightened further, knuckles whitening. "Then what was the point? All those years of being looked at, being wanted, being—" She stopped. Swallowed. "If it just disappears, what was any of it for?"

"You're describing beauty as something you had. A possession." Lilith kept her voice even, a surface without current. "What if it was something that moved through you instead? Something that was never yours to keep?"

Caroline's face did something complicated—resistance and recognition fighting for the same space.

"That sounds like giving up."

"Does it?" Lilith turned her pen once, slowly. "Or does it sound like stopping a war you were never going to win?"

The session continued for another twenty minutes—Caroline circling the same wound from different angles, Lilith offering questions that opened rather than closed. When the hour ended, they scheduled the follow-up with the particular formality of people who had touched something raw and needed distance from it.

The door clicked shut.

Lilith completed her notes with the efficiency of long practice. *Presents with identity disruption secondary to perceived loss of physical attractiveness. Core wound: self-worth fused with external validation. Recommended continued exploration of intrinsic vs. attributed value.*

The words came easily. The analysis was sound.

She checked the time. Her birthday dinner was in two hours.

The wine bar occupied a corner of the Northern Quarter that had been a textile warehouse, then a nightclub, then empty for a decade, and now held exposed brick and copper lighting fixtures with the careful carelessness of spaces designed to seem undesigned. Rain had threatened all afternoon and finally arrived as Lilith walked from the tram stop, fat drops that darkened the pavement in spreading coins.

She found the table near the back. Meera was already there—of course Meera was already there, Meera who had never been late to anything in the fifteen years Lilith had known her—along with two others: Sophie Chen, who taught something in the medical school that Lilith could never quite remember, and Adaora Obi, a solicitor whose firm had handled Lilith's flat purchase and who had somehow become a friend in the process.

"The birthday girl." Meera rose to embrace her, the familiar scent of cocoa butter and something floral. "Thirty looks good on you."

"Thirty looks exactly like twenty-nine." Lilith slid into her seat, accepted the glass of wine that Sophie pushed toward her. "Which looked exactly like twenty-eight. I'm beginning to suspect the whole system is arbitrary."

"Says the woman who doesn't age." Adaora's voice carried the particular dryness of someone who had spent the afternoon in contract negotiations. "Some of us are going grey, Lilith. Some of us are finding new lines every morning."

"You're thirty-two."

"And counting."

The conversation settled into its familiar rhythm—work complaints and weekend plans, the particular shorthand of women who had known each other through various configurations of crisis and contentment. Sophie was dating someone new, or possibly not dating someone new, the distinction unclear even to her. Adaora's firm was restructuring in ways that might mean promotion or might mean redundancy. Meera had transferred to the psychiatric liaison team at the Royal Infirmary, which meant better hours but more paperwork.

"Speaking of mental health," Sophie said, refilling glasses with the casual expertise of someone who had done this many times, "did you see that piece in the Guardian? About preventative Botox?"

"Preventative." Adaora's eyebrows rose. "As in, before you need it?"

"Before you show any signs of ageing whatsoever. Twenty-five-year-olds getting injections so they never develop expression lines." Sophie shook her head, a gesture that carried more fascination than disapproval. "The argument is that if you paralyse the muscles early enough, the creases never form."

"That's—" Meera paused, searching for the word. "Bleak? Is bleak the right word?"

"Expensive is the word. Three hundred quid every four months, minimum, for the rest of your life." Adaora swirled her wine. "Though I suppose if you're starting at twenty-five, you've got forty years of smooth forehead to amortise it over."

"It's not just Botox anymore." Sophie leaned forward, warming to the subject. "Threads. Fillers. That thing where they inject your own blood plasma back into your face. A woman at my gym gets something called a 'liquid facelift' every six months. She's thirty-four."

"Fighting the decay," Adaora said, and the word landed in the centre of the table like a stone dropped into still water.

*Decay.*

Lilith's hand paused around her glass. The word resonated somewhere deeper than the conversation warranted—echoed against images she had been carrying for months. A garden that refused to change. Silk screens held in artificial perfection. A stasis field maintained by bleeding hands.

"What about you, Lilith?" Sophie was looking at her now, the question genuine rather than rhetorical. "You never seem bothered by any of this. What's your secret?"

The table's attention shifted. Three women watching her with the particular curiosity reserved for people who seemed to have solved a problem everyone else was still working on.

Lilith set down her glass. "Everything changes. Fighting it seems exhausting."

"That's it?" Adaora's scepticism was affectionate but real. "Just acceptance?"

"There's something beautiful about the fact that it doesn't last." The words came easily—she had said versions of them to patients, to herself, to anyone who asked. "The body isn't a project. It's a vehicle. You maintain it, you use it, and eventually you return it."

"Return it where?"

"Back to where it came from." Lilith smiled, the expression genuine and also performing its own genuineness. "The universe doesn't care about your skincare routine."

Meera laughed—a warm sound that cut through the table's slight tension. "Very Buddhist of you."

"Very practical," Lilith corrected. "I've just decided not to spend my life at war with entropy."

The conversation moved on. Sophie recounted a disaster date. Adaora complained about a client who kept changing their mind. The wine bottles emptied and were replaced.

But Meera's attention returned, several times, to Lilith's face. The particular scrutiny of someone who had known her long enough to recognise the difference between presence and performance.

"You're somewhere else tonight."

The words came during a lull, when Sophie and Adaora were debating the dessert menu with the gravity of treaty negotiations. Meera said it quietly, not an accusation but an observation.

Lilith met her eyes. "What do you mean?"

"You're here, you're saying all the right things, you're—" Meera gestured vaguely. "Present. But there's this thing underneath. Like you're listening for something we can't hear."

The silence between them held a weight the rest of the table didn't notice.

"Long week," Lilith said. "Clinical load's been heavy."

"Mmm." Meera accepted this without accepting it. "How's Nadia? The wedding was last month, wasn't it?"

"Beautiful." Lilith was grateful for the subject change, and aware of being grateful, and aware that Meera probably recognised both. "She and Marcus looked genuinely happy. And my mother managed to hold her tongue through the entire reception."

"A miracle."

"A small one. She and Jeff have found their equilibrium, I think. They're less—" She searched for the word. "Effortful. About being a unit."

"That's good." Meera's hand found hers briefly, a gesture of connection that asked nothing except to be acknowledged. "You should visit more. She misses you."

"I will."

The words were true and also not true—a commitment that required nothing to make because Lilith could not, at this moment, see what keeping it would require.

The evening wound toward its natural conclusion. Dessert was split four ways. A final toast was raised to thirty years of being alive and whatever the next thirty might bring. Outside, the rain had stopped, leaving the streets with that particular shine of wet pavement reflecting sodium light.

Hugs on the pavement. Promises to do this again soon. The particular warmth of friendships maintained through scheduled contact.

Then the others were gone, and Lilith stood alone on the corner of a Northern Quarter street, Manchester's autumn air cool against her skin.

*Somewhere else.* Yes. She had been somewhere else. She had been thinking of gardens that refused to wilt, of a courtier dying in the mud with a woman who was finally, terribly real. She had been thinking of preservation—of faces and worlds and the desperate human project of stopping time.

She had given perfect advice about accepting impermanence. She had meant every word of it.

And three months ago, she had spent weeks maintaining a stasis field in Heian Japan, trying to trap a soul in eternal beauty, trying to freeze a moment of flesh against the wheel's turning.

The irony did not occur to her. She was not looking for it.

She walked toward home through streets still wet from rain, her mind already turning toward the notebooks in her flat, toward the threads she had been following through lifetimes she had witnessed and shaped.

She had a birthday to finish. The work was waiting.
