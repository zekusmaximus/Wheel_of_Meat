# Chapter 13, Section II: The Tracking Session

---

Night had settled over Manchester by the time she reached her flat. The building's corridor held its usual smell of other people's dinners—something with garlic from 4B, the vegetarian downstairs doing something unfortunate with lentils. Her key found the lock with the precision of long repetition.

Inside, the flat waited with the particular stillness of spaces kept deliberately empty. Functional furniture. Minimal decoration. The tracking corner by the window, where a cushion and a low table held her notebooks and the evidence of five years' work.

She did not turn on the main lights. The city's glow filtered through uncurtained windows, enough to navigate by, enough to see the shapes of things without their details.

Her birthday had ended. Or begun, depending on how one counted.

Thirty years old. The number meant nothing and everything—a threshold her culture had invested with significance, a marker on a timeline that stretched far longer than any calendar could measure. She had been older than thirty before. She would be older than thirty again.

But this body, this configuration, this Lilith Azami with her psychiatric credentials and her Manchester flat and her friends who worried she was somewhere else—this one had reached thirty today. The vehicle had logged another year.

She changed out of her dinner clothes. Washed her face. Attended to the body's requirements with the efficiency of someone preparing for work that would demand everything.

Then she settled into her corner. Spine straight. Hands open on her thighs, palms up, fingers slightly curved. The posture she had refined over five years until it felt less like sitting and more like anchoring.

The Heian thread was waiting. Had been waiting for three months, since she had set the intervention in motion and stepped back to let it unfold. Tonight she would see how it ended.

She closed her eyes. Let her breathing slow to something tidal. Reached backward through time toward the disaster she had made.

---

The transition came more easily now than it had in the early years. Consciousness thinning at its edges. The membrane between present and past becoming permeable, then porous, then absent.

She found the thread and followed it.

The Seiryō Pavilion materialised around her awareness—not as a place she occupied but as a place she witnessed, present and not-present, watching from a distance that had nothing to do with space. The gardens she had cultivated through months of careful pressure. The screens she had kept pristine. The woman she had constructed as eternal beauty, preserved against time like a butterfly pinned under glass.

But something was wrong.

The sky above the pavilion churned with colours that did not belong to the careful palette she had maintained. Greys and greens and the particular yellow-brown of storms gathering force. Wind moved through the garden in gusts that bent the carefully shaped pines, sent fallen leaves skittering across paths that should have held no fallen leaves at all.

The stasis was failing.

She reached for the mechanism—for the pressure she had been maintaining from across centuries, the subtle compulsion that drove her instrument to preserve what should not be preserved.

The Attendant.

She found her in the garden, running between the beds with movements that held the particular desperation of someone fighting a battle already lost. Hands bleeding from work they had been doing for hours. Face streaked with rain that was beginning to fall. The same face Lilith saw in mirrors—the sharp widow's peak, the strand of darker hair escaping over the left temple, the left eye that would show its pale green crescent in better light.

The Attendant was her. One of her own past incarnations, a woman born in this time with the same soul-pattern, living a life she did not remember living. Lilith had found her almost by accident while tracking the Heian thread—had recognised the resonance of her own deeper signature and understood what was possible.

She had pushed.

Not possession. Not control. Something subtler and in some ways worse. She had leaned into her past self from across a thousand years, applied pressure to the places where consciousness was pliable, and watched her own ancient incarnation develop obsessions she could not explain. The manic devotion to the pavilion. The bleeding hands that scrubbed surfaces already clean. The absolute certainty that Lady Hotaru must be preserved, must be kept beautiful, must never be allowed to decay.

The Attendant did not understand why she did these things. She only knew that she must.

And now the storm was tearing it all apart.

Lilith tried to strengthen the pressure. Pushed harder against her past self, trying to drive her toward some action that might save the intervention—

But she could not see clearly while pushing. The effort fragmented her attention, scattered her witness-consciousness into static. She was either steering or watching. She could not do both.

The choice crystallised: keep pushing blind, or release and see.

She released.

The effect was immediate. Across a thousand years, the Attendant stumbled mid-stride, her manic energy draining like water from a cracked vessel. She stood in the rain-lashed garden, chest heaving, bleeding hands hanging at her sides, and looked around at the destruction with the particular confusion of someone waking from a fever dream.

*What have I been doing? Why am I here?*

Lilith watched her own past self turn in a slow circle, taking in the torn screens, the scattered lanterns, the garden surrendering to the storm. The Attendant's face held no understanding—only the bewilderment of someone who had lost months to a compulsion that had evaporated without explanation.

Then she walked away.

Simply walked away, through the ruined gate, into the storm, toward whatever life remained to her after months of inexplicable obsession. Free now. Finally free, without ever knowing what she had been freed from.

Lilith watched her go—watched herself go, a woman she had been and did not remember being, disappearing into rain and darkness and the ordinary flow of a life she would never recall.

---

Without the Attendant's maintenance, the illusion collapsed entirely.

The screens tore from their frames and scattered across the garden like wounded birds. Lanterns that had burned without oil guttered and died. The stasis field—that careful construction of preserved beauty—shattered under the storm's indifferent force.

And in the pavilion's heart, stripped of every deception, Lady Hotaru lay dying.

Lilith found Kaoru there.

He had come through the storm, this courtier who should have been trapped in eternal longing, this soul she had tried to bind with beauty that never faded. He knelt in the mud beside a woman who was finally, terribly real—old and ill and mortal, her face showing every year the stasis had hidden, her body surrendering to the decay that Lilith had tried to weaponise against him.

He was holding her. Cradling her against his chest as the rain fell through the ruined roof, as the wind tore away the last pretences of perfection.

Lilith watched his face.

The courtier who had been trained since childhood to feel everything correctly, to respond to beauty with the appropriate aesthetic sensitivity, to perform his responses for an audience of refined observers—that man was gone. What remained was simpler. Rawer. A human being holding another human being as she died.

His lips moved. She could not hear the words, but she caught their shape, their meaning, the insight crystallising in him like ice forming on still water:

*It is beautiful because it is dying.*

The thought arrived in her awareness with the particular clarity of spiritual breakthrough—not as words he spoke but as understanding he achieved, a recognition that passed through him and changed something fundamental in its passing.

Everything she had built to trap him in desire—the perfect garden, the ageless beauty, the romance frozen in amber—had taught him the opposite lesson. The absence of impermanence was monstrous. The stasis was the horror, not the decay. Beauty required its own ending to mean anything at all.

Another acceleration. Another backfire.

She had given him exactly what he needed to progress.

---

Kaoru did not survive the night. The exposure, the exhaustion, the something-broken that happened when a soul achieves insight it is not yet ready to integrate—he died as dawn approached, still holding Hotaru, his face peaceful in a way that the living rarely managed.

Lilith watched the light leave his eyes and felt the thread dim.

The connection was fading. The effort of maintaining her witness-state across this distance, combined with the collapse of everything she had built—she could feel her reach weakening, her consciousness beginning to withdraw toward its proper place in time.

But before the thread went dark entirely, a thought surfaced unbidden:

*Is he here now? Somewhere in this time?*

She had been tracking his thread backward through history—through Heian Japan, through the Egyptian desert, through lives she had witnessed and interventions she had shaped. But the thread extended forward too. From Kaoru's death through centuries she had not yet traced, through incarnations she did not yet know, toward... when? Where?

Somewhere ahead, at the end of this chain, he existed in her world. His soul would surface in her own time, wearing a face she had not yet learned to recognise.

She could not skip ahead. Each life had to be traced through the next, the connection built link by link. To find where the thread emerged in her present, she would have to follow it through every incarnation between Heian Japan and now. Years of work. Maybe longer.

The thought settled into her like a seed finding soil.

And beneath it, another thought, harder to hold:

She had pushed her own past self. Used her own incarnation as an instrument without knowing whose hand she was using.

*How many other lives had she lived?*

She had spent five years tracking his thread. She had barely glanced at her own.

The connection broke. The Heian world dissolved into static, then silence, then the ordinary darkness behind her closed eyes.

Manchester reassembled around her. The flat. The tracking corner. The city's distant sounds filtering through windows she had not curtained.

Her hands were trembling. A headache pulsed at the edges of her awareness—the particular pressure of consciousness that had stretched beyond its usual reach.

The thread was dark. Would stay dark for months while whatever mechanism governed these things recovered from the effort.

She opened her eyes to a city that had not changed, a flat that held no evidence of where she had been, a birthday that had ended without celebration.

The failure was complete. The intervention had backfired.

And somewhere in the gap between what she had intended and what had occurred, a question waited that she was not yet ready to ask.
