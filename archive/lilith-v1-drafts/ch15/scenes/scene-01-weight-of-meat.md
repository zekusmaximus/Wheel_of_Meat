# Scene 1: The Weight of Meat

---

The leather of the chair was warm where Lilith's arms had rested. Thirty-one years of accumulated body heat—absorbed and dissipated through fabric and skin, absorbed again, a cycle that repeated with every breath, every shift of weight, every hour she spent in this chair listening to patients describe lives they could not leave.

Her shoulders carried six years of tracking in their tightened muscles. The tension had settled there so gradually she had stopped noticing—the same way one stopped noticing the weight of one's own skull, the constant pressure of bone and brain and blood pressing down through spine and ribs toward earth. But today the weight registered. Today every sensation registered with uncomfortable clarity.

The headache had started three hours ago, that particular pressure behind her left eye that came after extended work in the tracking corner. Not pain, exactly. Presence. The ghost of another body's sensations bleeding through into her own flesh, residue from hours spent inhabiting Sor Catalina's knees on Toledo stone floors, feeling the roughness of a sixteenth-century habit against skin that was simultaneously hers and not hers.

She had twenty minutes before her next patient.

Lilith pressed her fingers against her temples—a gesture that belonged to this body, this life, this present moment. The office around her was precisely as she had arranged it six years ago: the desk positioned to catch northern light without glare, the second chair angled to suggest conversation rather than interrogation, the small shelf of books selected for their spines rather than their contents. A performance of professional warmth calculated to make patients feel safe enough to speak.

The books had gathered dust. She had not opened them in months.

Through the window, Manchester's October afternoon painted grey across brick and pavement. The rain had stopped an hour ago but the streets still gleamed wetly, reflecting the kind of light that made everything look slightly unreal—too flat, too dull, the color leached from concrete and glass and skin until the city resembled its own photograph.

Four o'clock. Mrs. Okafor would arrive in eighteen minutes. Seventeen now.

Lilith's hands lay flat on the armrests, fingers spread against leather that had molded to their shape. How many hours had she spent in this chair? How many patients had sat across from her, describing the particular architecture of their suffering while she listened with the trained attention that was both genuine and performance at once?

She could see her reflection in the window glass—dark hair drawn back, the widow's peak and its escaped strand falling across her left temple, the face she had worn for thirty-one years overlaid on grey Manchester afternoon. The same face she had worn in Alexandria. In the Heian court. In the plague ward and the Mauryan empire and a dozen other configurations she was only beginning to remember.

The recognition had arrived in Chapter 13, two years ago. She had glimpsed her own thread then, seen the pattern of her face repeating across lives like a signature that never changed. But she had not followed it all the way down. Had not traced the full weight of what that constancy meant.

Today—tonight, when she returned to the tracking corner—she would.

But first: Mrs. Okafor. The work that paid for the flat, the office, the hours she spent in darkness watching a physician burn at a stake four centuries removed from Manchester rain.

Lilith straightened in her chair. The headache pulsed once behind her eye, then settled into its familiar pressure. Her shoulders released slightly—not rest, but the illusion of it, the performance of ease she had learned to wear like her professional wardrobe.

The knock came precisely at 4:18.

"Come in."

---

Mrs. Okafor entered with the careful movements of someone carrying something fragile. She was forty-seven, a secondary school teacher, mother of three, wife of nineteen years. Depressed, though she had not used that word in their first session. *Tired*, she had said. *Just so tired all the time.*

She sat in the chair across from Lilith with a heaviness that went beyond physical weight—the particular density of someone who had been holding themselves upright through will alone and was finally, cautiously, allowing themselves to collapse.

"How have you been since we last spoke?" Lilith kept her voice gentle. The clinical register, but softened. Professional warmth that was both calculation and genuine care—she had never determined which impulse was primary, and had stopped trying to separate them.

"The same." Mrs. Okafor's hands twisted in her lap. "That's the thing, isn't it? It's always the same. I wake up and I'm still..." She trailed off, searching for words.

"Still here," Lilith supplied.

"Yes." The relief in Mrs. Okafor's voice was immediate, physical. Someone had understood. "Still here. Still in this body. Still in this life. And tomorrow I'll wake up and it'll be the same. And the day after. And after. And I just—" Her hands stopped moving. "I can't get out. There's no door. I'm just... stuck. In my own skin. In my own head. Forever."

The words landed in Lilith's chest with unexpected weight.

She knew what Mrs. Okafor meant. Knew it the way her body knew the chair's leather, the pressure behind her eye, the tightness in her shoulders that six years of tracking had embedded in muscle memory. The feeling of being trapped in flesh that would not release you, of waking into the same configuration day after day with no exit visible.

But Mrs. Okafor's prison had a door. Had an ending. Death would release her, would dissolve the boundaries of self and skin and return her consciousness to the wheel that turned beneath all lives, grinding meat into lesson and lesson into new meat.

Lilith's prison had no such door.

Her hands tightened on the armrests. The leather creased under her fingers—a small sound, barely audible, but Mrs. Okafor was looking at her own lap and did not notice.

"That feeling of being stuck," Lilith said. Her voice remained steady, clinical. "It's one of the most difficult experiences we can have. The sense that we're trapped in circumstances we didn't choose and can't change."

Mrs. Okafor nodded without looking up.

"But there's a difference between the feeling of being trapped and the reality of it." Lilith leaned forward slightly—the posture of engaged attention, of someone offering something valuable rather than simply managing distress. "Your body is the body you have. Your life is the life you're living. These are facts. But they're not prisons."

"They feel like prisons."

"Yes. The feeling is real. That's important to acknowledge." Lilith paused, choosing words with the precision she would use for sutures. "But feeling trapped and being trapped aren't the same thing. Right now, in this moment, you're sitting in this chair. You're breathing. Your heart is beating. These are the conditions of your existence. You can work with them or fight them. Fighting makes the prison real."

Mrs. Okafor's hands had stopped twisting. She was listening now, her attention caught by something in Lilith's voice—the authority of someone who spoke from knowledge rather than theory.

"Working with means what?" Mrs. Okafor asked.

"Accepting that this is the body you have. This is the life you're living. Not because you chose it—you didn't choose your genetics or your nervous system or half the circumstances that shape your days. But because this is what is." Lilith's voice had dropped into the register she used for truths she believed absolutely. "You can't leave your body. You can't step outside your life. So the question becomes: how do you live *in* what you cannot leave?"

The words were true. Lilith believed them completely—had counseled dozens of patients through this exact recognition, had watched them move from resistance to acceptance, from fighting their circumstances to working with them.

But beneath her steady voice, beneath the clinical precision and genuine wisdom, something else moved. A recognition she could not speak and Mrs. Okafor could not hear.

Mrs. Okafor's body was temporary. The prison she described had walls that death would dissolve. In sixty years, perhaps seventy, the meat that held her consciousness would fail, would stop, would release her into whatever came next.

Lilith had woken up a thousand times. Ten thousand. More. Always here. Always in flesh. Always turning.

The weight of bodies she had worn pressed against her ribs—not memory yet, but the approaching certainty of memory, the knowledge gathering at the edge of awareness that tonight she would trace her own thread and feel the full weight of what she was asking Mrs. Okafor to accept.

This is the body you have. This is the life you're living.

And after this body fails, there will be another. And another. And another. Until—

Lilith's hands released the armrests. She folded them in her lap, the gesture of composed attention, of someone fully present to another's suffering without being overwhelmed by it.

"Does that help?" she asked.

Mrs. Okafor was quiet for a moment. Then she nodded. "Yes. I think—yes. It helps."

They spent the remaining twenty minutes working through specifics: how to notice resistance in the body, how to practice acceptance without resignation, how to distinguish between changing what could be changed and accepting what could not. Practical tools. Cognitive frameworks. The architecture of adaptation that Lilith had built for dozens of patients and believed in with the certainty of someone who had seen it work.

For them. For people whose bodies would someday fail and free them.

For her—

The thought cut off. There was work to do. Work in this office, and then work in the tracking corner. Work that had consumed six years and would consume however many more it took to finish what she had started.

Mrs. Okafor left at five o'clock looking lighter than when she had arrived. The session had helped. The counsel had been genuine, wise, exactly what she needed to hear.

Lilith sat alone in her chair, hands resting on armrests that were warm with her own heat, and felt the weight of meat she could not set down pressing through shoulders, spine, ribs, all the way down to the chair that held her body the way flesh held consciousness the way the wheel held everything.

Always turning.

Always here.

She had one more patient at six. After that: the tracking corner. The notebooks. The work that mattered more than the work that paid for it.

And tonight—tonight she would trace her own thread. Would follow it back through all the bodies she had worn. Would feel the full weight of the wheel she had been on longer than she had consciously known.

The headache pulsed behind her left eye.

Lilith closed her eyes and counted her breaths—one, two, three, the meditation practice she taught patients and used herself, the rhythm that steadied the body when the mind could not.

Fifty-three minutes until her next patient.

Fifty-two now.

The leather was warm where her arms rested. The city was grey beyond the window. The body continued its work—breathing, circulating, processing sensation into awareness, holding her consciousness in meat that would someday fail and free her into the next configuration.

And the next.

And the next.

Unless she finished first.
