# Scene 2: Entering the Vessel

---

The flat was dark when Lilith returned.

She did not turn on the lights. The tracking work required darkness—or perhaps it simply felt more appropriate to do this work in shadow, where the boundaries between present and past blurred more easily, where Manchester's October night could dissolve into Toledo's autumn afternoon four centuries removed.

Her last patient had left at seven. She had walked home through streets still wet from afternoon rain, past the Piccadilly Gardens where teenagers gathered around phone screens, past the curry houses exhaling turmeric and cardamom into damp air, past lives being lived in ignorance of the wheel that turned beneath them all.

The tracking corner waited.

She had arranged it carefully when she first began this work: the northeast corner of the flat's second bedroom, the space she had told her sister would be an office but had never furnished with desk or files. Just cushions on bare floor, notebooks stacked against the wall, the particular quality of silence that accumulated in rooms used for one purpose only.

Lilith sat cross-legged on the cushion worn to her shape by six years of this posture. Her spine straightened automatically—not the meditation posture she taught patients, but close enough that her body knew how to settle, how to find the stillness that preceded the work.

The notebooks were to her right. Seventy-three of them now, their spines labeled with dates and names: Ka. Chandra. Philon. Verinus. Macarius. Kaoru. Diego. Each life documented, each intervention recorded, each backfire analyzed with the clinical precision that was supposed to prevent the next failure but never did.

Diego's notebook was still open from this morning's session, her handwriting cramped and urgent across pages that tracked his final weeks. She had been inhabiting Sor Catalina for months, guiding the vessel's counsel toward strategic betrayals, cultivating the conditions that would trap Diego in hatred he could not release.

Tonight was the auto-de-fé. Tonight the trap would close. Tonight she would watch him burn with the hatred she had so carefully tended, and the fetter would crystallize into permanent obstacle.

Or that was the plan.

Lilith closed her eyes and reached.

---

The transition was never smooth. Six years of practice had made it familiar but not comfortable—the sensation of her awareness stretching across space and time like a bridge built from nothing, sustained by will and whatever power she had accumulated through lives she was only beginning to remember.

The tracking felt different now than it had with Ka, with Chandra. Then it had been observation only, grainy and distant, like watching through water. But with each life, each intervention, the access had deepened. By Egypt she could drop into dreams. By Heian she could push vessels from afar. And now—

Now she could inhabit.

Sor Catalina's body received her like a glove accepts a hand. The fit was not perfect—the vessel had her own consciousness, her own habits, her own genuine faith that made her body move in ways Lilith had to work with rather than override. But after months of sustained presence, the flesh had grown accustomed to her. The beata's prayers continued even when Lilith wore her skin, the words so automatic that consciousness divided: Sor Catalina believing she prayed, Lilith using that belief as cover for her own work.

The dissonance was immediate and total.

Lilith sat in her Manchester flat, spine straight, breathing steady, the October night cool against her face.

Lilith knelt in a stone-floored room in Toledo, autumn sunlight slanting through shutters, the roughness of a grey habit against skin that was not her skin but responded to her awareness as though it were.

Two bodies. Two sets of sensation. Two moments separated by four hundred years, existing simultaneously in her split attention.

Sor Catalina's knees ached. The beata spent hours kneeling in prayer, and the pain had become so familiar the vessel barely noticed it. But Lilith noticed—felt the particular pressure of stone through flesh, the way bone met floor with nothing but skin and faith to cushion the contact.

The hands folded in prayer were rougher than Lilith's Manchester hands. Older too—Sor Catalina was forty-three, her fingers marked by work and weather in ways that psychiatrists' hands never were. These hands had touched the sick, had washed the dying, had held rosaries until the beads wore smooth.

These hands had also guided Tomás de Mendoza toward betrayal.

The memory surfaced in the vessel's consciousness: Tomás weeping in this very room three weeks ago, his son Rafael arrested, his own guilt consuming him like fever. Sor Catalina had counseled him with genuine compassion—the beata truly believed confession cleansed, that naming one's sins freed the soul even if it destroyed the body.

Lilith had simply... amplified. Had leaned into the vessel's natural inclinations, had shaped the counsel toward strategic ends. When Tomás asked whether to name others, Sor Catalina's faith said *truth honors God*. Lilith's guidance beneath it whispered *name the physician*.

The vessel had offered the counsel she believed in. Lilith had merely directed which counsel to offer, which questions to ask, which doubts to soothe.

Now—

The knock came at the stone chamber's door.

Sor Catalina rose from prayer—or Lilith moved the vessel's body to standing, or both at once, the boundary between host and inhabitant blurring as it always did when action was required. The beata's consciousness accepted the movement as her own decision. Lilith's awareness rode it like a current.

"Enter."

Tomás de Mendoza stood in the doorway with the particular heaviness of a man carrying news he had not wanted to deliver. His face was grey, his eyes reddened from weeping or lack of sleep or both.

"The tribunal has accepted my testimony," he said. His voice carried no triumph, only the exhausted relief of someone who had passed an unbearable weight to others and was now lighter but not cleansed. "I am... they have said my family is no longer under suspicion."

"God be praised." Sor Catalina's voice—but also Lilith's voice, using the vessel's faith to shape the response. "Your honesty has freed you, my son. Truth is its own mercy."

"Diego will burn tomorrow." The words came flat, factual. "They told me this morning. The auto-de-fé is scheduled for dawn. He..." Tomás swallowed. "He did not confess fully. Did not name others. So there will be no strangulation before the flames."

Sor Catalina's heart beat steady and slow in her chest. The beata felt genuine pity—she prayed for all souls, even heretics, even those who chose suffering over truth. Lilith felt something else: satisfaction at a strategy executed correctly, at pieces falling into place, at the hatred she had cultivated reaching its inevitable harvest.

Diego would burn. And burning, betrayed by his friend, persecuted for heritage he had tried to hide, destroyed by the very usefulness he had believed would protect him—he would break. The hatred would crystallize. Would become the fetter that trapped him in the wheel for another cycle, another life, another chance for Lilith to stay ahead of him.

"I will attend the burning," Sor Catalina said. "To pray for his soul."

To watch the trap close, Lilith thought. To witness the backfire fail to fire. To see hatred take root and hold.

Tomás left. Sor Catalina returned to prayer.

Lilith waited.

---

Dawn came to Toledo with the particular clarity of autumn mornings in high-altitude cities. The sky was pale blue, the air thin and cold, the light sharp enough to etch shadows cleanly against stone.

The Plaza de Zocodover had filled before sunrise. Merchants. Nobles. Peasants. Families with children. Everyone who could walk had come to witness the auto-de-fé—spectacle and warning both, the Holy Office's justice made visible in flesh and fire.

Sor Catalina stood at the plaza's edge, grey habit blending with the crowd, veil drawn forward to shadow her face. The beata's hands were folded in prayer. Her lips moved silently through Hail Marys. Her consciousness was entirely occupied with genuine devotion, with the work of interceding for souls about to face God's judgment.

Lilith watched through the vessel's eyes.

Seven stakes had been erected. Seven condemned. Diego was third.

They brought him out in the sanbenito—yellow tunic painted with flames and demons, the coroza on his head marking him as heretic, judaizer, relapsed. His face was grey with exhaustion, but his spine was straight. The physician's careful posture, maintained even now. The performance of dignity in the face of complete destruction.

The officials read the charges. Diego's crimes catalogued with bureaucratic precision: lighting Sabbath candles, observing Jewish fasts, speaking Hebrew prayers, maintaining converso sympathies. The evidence: his own partial confession, Tomás's testimony, witnesses who had seen him touch his fingers in sequence—the physician's gesture that some claimed was secret prayer.

They bound him to the stake. Built the pyre around his feet. Dry wood that would catch quickly and burn hot. No mercy for those who refused complete confession.

Sor Catalina prayed for his soul with genuine compassion.

Lilith watched for the hatred to appear.

The official nodded. Guards brought torches.

The straw caught first—quick flame, rising heat. Diego's face was visible above the spreading fire, his expression distant, observing. The physician noting symptoms even as the symptoms consumed him.

Lilith leaned forward in the vessel's attention. This was the moment. The betrayal by his friend. The persecution by the Holy Office. The burning alive for heritage he could not change and faith he had tried to hide. Every condition perfectly calibrated to generate the kind of hatred that would fester across lives, that would become permanent obstacle, permanent fetter.

The flames climbed toward Diego's chest.

His face—

Changed.

Not into hatred. Into something else. Something Lilith recognized with the sick certainty of watching a strategy collapse in real time.

Release.

She had seen it before. In Chandra's eyes when Devaka's betrayal taught him generosity could not depend on reciprocity. In every intervention that backfired, every obstacle that became stepping stone.

But she had been so careful this time. Had cultivated conditions specifically designed to prevent release. Betrayal so complete it could not be forgiven. Persecution so unjust it demanded rage. Suffering so visceral the body itself would rebel and carry that rebellion into the next life as permanent scar.

And still—

Diego looked at Tomás in the crowd. His eyes found the man who had betrayed him, held his gaze for a moment that stretched across the plaza. And then he looked away.

Not in disgust. Not in hatred.

In release.

The flames took his legs. The sanbenito blackened and burned. Diego's body began the process of dying—skin blistering, flesh charring, the meat that had carried him through forty-three years of careful performance returning to ash and smoke.

And on his face: peace.

Not triumph. Not forgiveness—Lilith could see that much from the distance of Sor Catalina's eyes. Diego had not forgiven Tomás. Had simply released him. Set down the burning coal of hatred before it could burn him from within. Chosen to die free of the poison she had tried so hard to make him drink.

The backfire witnessed in real time.

Everything she had done—months of sustained presence in Sor Catalina, strategic counsel that guided Tomás toward betrayal, conditions cultivated specifically to generate permanent hatred—all of it had become the crucible that burned away the very fetter she had tried to forge.

Sor Catalina prayed. Her lips moved through familiar words: *Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.*

Lilith watched Diego burn and felt something cold settle in her chest—not her chest, Sor Catalina's chest, the vessel's body responding to awareness that belonged to someone else, somewhere else, four hundred years distant.

The pattern was undeniable now. Not accident. Not coincidence. Structural.

Every intervention backfired. Every obstacle became stepping stone. Every attempt to trap him gave him exactly what he needed to progress.

The flames consumed Diego's body. Smoke rose thick and grey into Toledo's autumn sky. The crowd watched with the particular attention of people who had come to witness justice but were seeing something else—something they could not name, something that made the burning seem less like punishment and more like transformation.

Diego's eyes closed. His body sagged against the ropes. The meat failed, stopped, released its grip on consciousness that was already burning forward toward—

Lilith pulled back.

---

The withdrawal was abrupt, disorienting. One moment she was Sor Catalina in the plaza, smoke in her lungs and prayers on her lips. The next she was Lilith in Manchester, spine straight and body cold, the tracking corner dark around her.

The transition left her shaking.

Two bodies separated by four centuries, reunited into one. Sor Catalina would continue her life, would pray for Diego's soul, would counsel others in the converso quarter, would never know what had moved through her flesh and used her faith as weapon against a man she had genuinely tried to help.

Lilith's hands trembled against her thighs. The October night was cold—Manchester autumn nothing like Toledo autumn but her body could not tell the difference, could not separate the memories of two places, two temperatures, two sets of sensation still bleeding together in awareness not yet fully reunited.

She had inhabited two bodies tonight.

Watched a man burn in one.

Felt the meat failing in both—Diego's flesh consumed by flame, Lilith's flesh exhausted by hours of sustained presence across time and space.

The wheel turning for both of them.

The taste of ash in her mouth was real. Impossible—she had not breathed Toledo smoke, had only watched through Sor Catalina's borrowed eyes—but real nonetheless. Her body remembered what her mind knew was memory of another's sensation.

How many bodies had she worn? How many times had she tasted ash or blood or the particular copper flavor of fear?

The question surfaced without answer. But it would have an answer. Tonight she would trace her own thread all the way down and feel the full weight of what she was.

But first: sit. Breathe. Let the two bodies fully separate. Let Lilith return completely to Lilith's meat.

The shaking continued for long minutes.

When it finally stopped, she reached for her notebook and wrote in handwriting that was not quite steady:

*Intervention: Complete. Method: Sustained presence in Sor Catalina; guided Tomás's betrayal; witnessed burning.*

*Result: Backfire. Diego released hatred at the stake. Pattern confirmed—opposition generates precisely the friction required for progress.*

*Six attempts. Six backfires. The structure is not negotiable.*

*New approach required.*

She set down the pen and sat in darkness, breathing, counting her heartbeats, feeling the particular weight of meat that had inhabited two bodies tonight and would inhabit only one body tomorrow but would someday—unless she finished first—inhabit another.

And another.

And another.

The wheel turning beneath everything.

Ready to be felt in full.

Ready to be known for what it was.

Tonight.
