# Scene 6: Coda—The Loneliness of Knowing

---

The phone woke her.

Lilith surfaced from sleep that had been deeper than rest, darker than dreams, the kind of absolute unconsciousness the body demanded after being pushed past its limits. For a moment she did not know where she was—the disorientation of someone who had inhabited too many bodies in too short a time, whose awareness had been split between Manchester and Toledo until the boundary between present and past had thinned to nothing.

Then: her bedroom. Her flat. Manchester. October afternoon light through the window, grey and diffuse.

The phone continued its buzzing against the nightstand.

She reached for it with a hand that felt strange—too light, too present, too singular after a night of feeling ten thousand hands pressing against her awareness. The screen showed: Nadia.

Lilith answered. "Hello."

"Finally!" Her sister's voice carried the particular exasperation of someone who had been calling multiple times. "I've been trying to reach you all morning. Are you still in bed? It's past two."

Two in the afternoon. She had slept for—she calculated—seven hours. Not enough after twenty-four hours awake and six hours of the deepest tracking she had ever done. But apparently enough for her body to decide consciousness was preferable to the dreams that had been circling at the edge of awareness. Dreams of wheels turning, of hands reaching, of threads running parallel toward light she could not quite see.

"I worked late," Lilith said. Her voice sounded normal. Professional. The mask fitting easily despite everything that had changed beneath it. "What do you need?"

"Nothing urgent. Just calling to check in." Nadia's tone softened slightly. "You sounded exhausted last time we talked. I wanted to make sure you were taking care of yourself."

The concern was genuine. Nadia worried about her—had been worrying more over the past few years as Lilith's work consumed more of her attention, as the tracking ate time and energy that should have gone to sleep or food or the ordinary maintenance of a life.

Lilith sat up in bed. The movement made her head swim briefly—dehydration, probably, or simply the body's protest at being asked to function after inadequate recovery. She should eat. Should drink water. Should do all the small things that kept meat operational.

"I'm fine," she said. The lie was automatic, but not entirely a lie. She was fine. Just... changed. Fundamentally altered in ways that Nadia could never understand because Nadia had never perceived the wheel, had never felt the weight of ten thousand bodies, had never stood at her window and watched a man burn four centuries ago while inhabiting another woman's flesh.

"You don't sound fine. You sound—" Nadia paused, searching for words. "Distant. Like you're somewhere else."

Accurate. Lilith was somewhere else. Was standing at the intersection of past and present and future, watching threads converge, feeling the wheel turn beneath everything while Manchester afternoon pressed grey light against her window and her sister's voice carried mundane concern through a phone connection.

"I'm here," Lilith said. "Just tired. Long night at work."

"The work you don't talk about." Not quite accusation. More like observation tinged with hurt. Nadia knew Lilith kept things from her. Had known for years. The tracking was not something that could be explained to someone who had never felt their own thread, who lived in blissful ignorance of the wheel beneath them.

"Patients," Lilith said. Which was true—she had seen Mrs. Okafor yesterday afternoon, had counseled her about accepting embodiment, about working with the life she could not leave. The session felt simultaneously recent and impossibly distant, separated from this moment by a night that had contained more revelation than the previous six years combined.

"How many patients do you see at midnight?" Nadia's skepticism was gentle but present.

"Research," Lilith amended. "Reading case studies. Preparing for sessions." Also true, in the way that tracking past incarnations to understand karmic progression was research, was preparation, was work that informed her understanding of how consciousness developed across lives.

Nadia sighed. The sound carried something between frustration and resignation—the particular quality of someone who knew they were being deflected but loved the deflector too much to push harder. "Just... take care of yourself, okay? You're no good to your patients if you burn out."

Burn out. The phrase landed strangely after watching Diego burn at the stake, after feeling flesh consumed by flame while her own flesh sat safely in Manchester darkness. Different kinds of burning. Different kinds of meat failing. But the principle was the same: bodies had limits, could be pushed only so far before they broke.

"I will," Lilith said. "I promise."

They talked for a few more minutes about nothing—Nadia's work at the secondary school, their parents' health, plans for Christmas that was still months away but apparently required discussion. The ordinary architecture of family life, the small maintenance conversations that kept relationships functional even when deeper understanding was absent.

Lilith performed her part easily. Asked appropriate questions. Made appropriate responses. Maintained the fiction that she was simply a busy psychiatrist who worked too hard and needed reminding to rest.

The mask fit perfectly. Had always fit. Would continue to fit for however long was required.

But underneath—

Underneath, everything had changed.

When Nadia finally said goodbye and the call ended, Lilith sat on the edge of her bed and felt the weight of performance. Not heavy. Not exhausting. Simply present. The gap between what people saw and what she was had always existed. Last night had simply made that gap wider, more visible, more impossible to bridge.

---

She made herself eat. Toast with butter, tea with sugar, the simple carbohydrates her body needed to restore what the night's work had depleted. The food tasted flat, textureless, as though her awareness was still partially engaged in tracking mode where Manchester present competed with Toledo past and the boundaries between times blurred.

But she ate anyway. Maintenance. The care of meat that would carry her to the threshold if she kept it functional long enough.

While eating, she looked at her phone. Three missed calls from Nadia. Two text messages from colleagues about scheduling. One email from the practice manager asking if she had decided about taking sabbatical.

Sabbatical. She had been considering it for months. The tracking consumed more time than her clinical practice, and the tension between the two had been growing. Patients needed her present, needed her attention undivided. But how could she be present to their suffering when she was also tracking souls across centuries, watching incarnations cycle through lessons that made contemporary problems seem trivial by comparison?

The email sat unanswered. She would need to respond. Would need to decide how much of her present life to sacrifice for the work that mattered more than anything in the present life mattered.

But not today. Today she was still integrating. Still processing. Still feeling the weight of revelations that had changed how she understood everything.

She finished eating and went to the window.

The afternoon was grey, the kind of October day where light never quite arrived, where morning transitioned to afternoon without becoming brighter. People walked past on the street below—students heading to campus, workers heading home, lives being lived in the ordinary way that required no awareness of wheels or thresholds or the meat they wore that would someday fail and free them into new configurations.

Lilith watched them and felt the double vision.

That woman pushing a stroller: another soul on the wheel. Cycling through motherhood in this life, accumulating the lessons motherhood taught, the particular refinements that came from caring for new meat, from watching another consciousness develop in flesh you were responsible for protecting.

That man with the briefcase: another soul. Working toward something in his current incarnation, progressing or stagnating depending on whether he saw the patterns or simply repeated them in ignorance.

Everyone cycling. Everyone wearing meat. Everyone approaching or retreating from thresholds they could not perceive.

The loneliness of it settled into her chest.

She could not explain what she knew. Could not turn to Nadia or colleagues or patients and say: *I have felt the wheel. I know what we are. I have traced my own thread across eons and felt ten thousand bodies worn and discarded. I know there is a threshold, a finishing, a way off. And I am close. Closer than you will ever be unless you do the work across countless lives that I have done.*

They would think her insane. Would suggest rest, therapy, medication. Would interpret her knowledge as breakdown rather than breakthrough, as psychosis rather than perception of pattern that existed whether perceived or not.

So she could not speak.

The clarity was almost peaceful. She did not need to explain. Did not need anyone else's validation or understanding. The knowledge lived in her body now, in the somatic memory of hands worn and discarded, in the felt sense of the threshold approaching.

She knew. That was enough.

Except—

The thought surfaced before she could stop it.

There was one other person who might understand. Not now—he did not know yet what he was, did not perceive the wheel or the threshold or the work that spanned incarnations. But someday. Maybe. If they both continued progressing. If they both approached the threshold from their different angles and their awareness deepened to the point where words could carry what she knew.

He would understand. Because he was doing the same work. Was on the same wheel. Was approaching the same threshold from a different position.

And if they ever met—if she found him in the present, engineered a meeting, established the proximity her new strategy required—she might someday be able to tell someone who could actually hear it.

The thought opened something in her chest that felt dangerously close to hope.

She stopped it. Competition. One at a time. The structure was not negotiable.

But the loneliness remained. And beneath it, the smallest seed of something that might, in four years, grow into the need to tell someone. To confess. To unburden herself of knowledge that was becoming unbearable in its isolation.

Even if he could not hear it. Even if he misunderstood. Even if the confession itself was another kind of intervention, another move in the competition she now understood was real and structural and unavoidable.

The need to be known—even partially, even imperfectly—might eventually outweigh the strategic calculus that said silence was safer.

But not yet. Not for years. Not until the loneliness had accumulated to the point where unburdening mattered more than caution.

She filed the recognition away. Marked it as important. Continued watching Manchester afternoon unfold in ignorance of wheels that turned beneath it.

The light was fading when Lilith finally moved away from the window. Four-thirty in the afternoon. The October day dying early, the way October days did in Manchester. Soon it would be full dark. Soon the city would transition to evening, to night, to the hours she normally spent in the tracking corner doing the work that mattered more than sleep or food or the ordinary maintenance of a life.

But not tonight. Tonight she needed rest. Needed integration. Needed to let the revelations settle into her body so they could inform action rather than simply overwhelming awareness.

Tomorrow she would return to the tracking. Would observe the Renaissance skeptic as he developed. Would begin considering how to track present-day incarnations. Would start developing the skills that direct contact would require.

But tonight: rest.

She passed the bathroom mirror on her way to prepare for bed and stopped.

Her reflection looked back. The same face she had seen in the window earlier. The same face she had worn in Alexandria and China and Heian Japan and every incarnation she could remember.

The widow's peak. The single dark strand falling across her left temple. The eyes that watched with the particular stillness she had carried across how many lives?

The same face.

Diego's face had changed every time. Ka to Chandra to Philon to Verinus to Macarius to Kaoru to Diego. Different features every incarnation. Different configurations of meat that bore no resemblance except in the pattern beneath.

But hers never changed.

She had noted the question last night and filed it. Now, looking at her reflection in late afternoon light, it surfaced again.

Why?

Was it because she was further along? Because proximity to the threshold stabilized form across incarnations?

Or was it something else? Some pattern she was still too close to see, some structural reality that would become clear only when she had more distance—or perhaps less distance, when she was standing at the threshold itself and could look back and see the whole shape at once?

The question would not answer itself through staring at mirrors. She let it go. Marked it again as important. Continued the work of preparing for rest.

She had been herself for longer than she had known.

The recognition was both comfort and weight. Comfort because constancy suggested something stable beneath the cycling, something that persisted through meat worn and discarded. Weight because if she had been wearing the same face for eons, that face had witnessed suffering she could not fully remember, had looked at lovers and children and friends who died while she continued, had accumulated the kind of exhaustion that came from watching the wheel turn while being unable to step off.

Until now.

Now she was close. Close enough to feel the edge. Close enough to commit to stepping off rather than cycling again.

It was time to stop being this face, this configuration, this pattern that had repeated across incarnations for longer than she could trace.

It was time to finish.

The reflection watched her with eyes that had seen empires rise and fall, that had closed in plague wards and birthing beds and quiet rooms where age simply stopped the heart. The same eyes that would, if everything went according to the work she had committed to, see the threshold and step across it into whatever came after the wheel stopped turning.

This life. The last life.

The face that would finally be allowed to stop being a face at all.

Lilith looked at herself for a long moment—the kind of looking that was also recognition, also farewell, also commitment.

Then she turned away from the mirror and prepared for rest.

The wheel turned beneath everything. But she knew where the edge was now.

And she was walking toward it with eyes open, awareness clear, commitment certain.

One step at a time.

Ready to finish.

Ready to stop being.

Ready—when the time came—to step off the wheel and discover what existence looked like without the endless cycling through meat, without the dying and being born and dying again, without the weight of bodies worn for longer than human history.

Ready.

The work continued. The loneliness remained. The knowledge could not be shared except perhaps with one other soul who might someday understand if she could find him, if she could get close enough, if the strategic shift succeeded where six years of indirect intervention had failed.

But even alone, even carrying knowledge that isolated her from everyone who had not felt what she had felt, she was ready.

The wheel turned.

But the edge was visible.

And she was walking toward it.

One step at a time.

This life.

The last life.

Ready.
