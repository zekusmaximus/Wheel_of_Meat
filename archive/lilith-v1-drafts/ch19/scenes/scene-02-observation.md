# Scene 2: The Observation — Spring 1862

The siege sounds were muffled by distance and the thick walls of the converted temple, but Wei Shufen's hands knew when artillery was coming. They would pause, just slightly, over whatever wound she was treating. Not stopping. Never stopping. But acknowledging, in the grammar of the body, that the world outside was actively trying to kill everything she was working to save.

Lilith observed from the strange angle that tracking provided—neither inside Wei's head nor entirely outside it. What Wei saw, what Wei felt—the information arrived but remained separate. Like watching a performance in a language she knew well but had not been born speaking.

The aid station occupied what had once been a Buddhist temple. The icons had been removed—the Taiping faith permitted no idols—but something of the space's original purpose lingered in the proportions of the room, the quality of light through high windows, the way sound moved. Sick and wounded men lay on straw pallets arranged in rows. There were perhaps forty of them. By Lilith's count, at least twelve would be dead within a week regardless of treatment.

Wei moved among them with an efficiency that bordered on ruthlessness. Triage by touch: a hand on a forehead, a glance at bandages, the quick assessment of who could be saved, who was already dead, and who occupied the brutal middle ground of dying too slowly to ignore but too certainly to prioritize.

*She counts*, Lilith noted with something approaching respect. Clinical as diagnosis.

And she did count. Every patient Wei treated, every outcome—survival or death—was entered into a small ledger she kept tucked in her waistband. Lilith watched her update it after each round of treatment. Careful notation. Running totals. The arithmetic of triage.

*48 saved. 23 lost.*

The numbers themselves meant little—context shifted their significance—but the act of counting was the tell. This was a woman who believed the numbers mattered. Who needed to know whether she was winning or losing.

*Outcome attachment*, Lilith assessed. *Believes the ledger measures something real about her merit.*

She felt no contempt for this. She understood it too well. The soul's development always passed through this phase—the phase where actions were weighed against results, where generosity was measured by gratitude received, where determination was validated by success achieved. It was attachment, yes. But it was also a necessary station along the path.

The theological framework was obvious. Taiping Christianity—that strange hybrid of Hong Xiuquan's visions and whatever Protestant missionary material had reached him—wrapped everything in divine purpose. Wei wasn't just treating wounded; she was participating in God's work. Every soldier saved was a soul preserved for the Heavenly Kingdom. Every death was... what? A mystery. A test. A failure she would need to answer for.

Lilith watched her pray before treating a soldier whose gut wound had turned septic. Quick words, almost silent, the gesture of hands pressed together and then opened toward the work ahead. The prayer did nothing medically. The soldier died that afternoon, his peritonitis unstoppable by nineteenth-century methods.

Wei recorded the death in her ledger. *24 lost.*

She didn't adjust her faith. That was what made this incarnation both admirable and dangerous. The death became a data point in a theology that could absorb any data point, that could interpret any outcome as part of God's plan. Wei's certainty wasn't fragile. It was pliable. It could bend around any fact without breaking.

*The determination is genuine*, Lilith observed. *The contamination is in the outcomes—in believing the ledger tells her something about where she stands with the divine.*

She expanded her observation, letting herself feel more of Wei's internal state. It was always a risk—the closer she got, the more the observation became participation—but she needed to understand the architecture of this soul's current configuration before she decided how to proceed.

What she found was... complex.

Wei Shufen was thirty-two years old. Hakka by birth, which meant outsider by definition—a member of the guest people who had migrated southward centuries ago and never quite belonged. She had learned medicine from her grandmother, a bone-setter and herbalist. When the Taiping rebellion reached her village, she had joined not from revolutionary fervor but from calculation: the Taiping treated women as something approaching human. They could fight, lead, own property, refuse husbands. Compared to the Qing alternative, it was barely a choice.

The faith had come later. Genuine conversion, Lilith assessed—not the performance of conviction. Something in Hong Xiuquan's wild theology had spoken to a hunger Wei hadn't known she carried. The idea that this suffering world would be transformed. That the Heavenly Kingdom was not metaphor but coming reality.

Eight years later, with the kingdom collapsing, Wei still believed.

*Contaminated determination*, Lilith thought, crystallizing her assessment. *She helps because it's God's work. She endures because divine reward awaits. If those props were removed...*

She paused.

If those props were removed, what would remain?

This was the question she had been working for eight years. Across seven incarnations, she had intervened—subtly, then less subtly, then with every capacity she could access. And every time, the result had been... not what she expected.

The props fell. The soul remained. More: the soul *strengthened*.

Was it possible the props weren't structural? That removing them didn't collapse the determination but purified it?

The question unsettled her in a way she didn't fully understand. She filed it for later.

She watched Wei set a young soldier's broken arm, working quickly, her hands sure despite the sweat on her forehead. The soldier was perhaps nineteen. He'd been crushed when a wall collapsed during the last assault. His arm would heal, probably. He would return to active duty within a month.

*And then?*

The thought arrived unbidden, and Lilith recognized it as something new. Not strategy. Not calculation. Something more like... curiosity. About what would happen if she didn't intervene at all. If she simply watched.

But she couldn't simply watch. Could she?

*Together doesn't hold.* The phrase from some deep memory, some awareness that predated her current life. Only one of them could complete. If she did nothing, he would continue. And if he completed first...

She felt the familiar pressure—not physical, but something deeper. The weight of eons of work. The cost of letting it slip away.

And so she began, very carefully, to slip tendrils of causation through the fabric of 1862.
