# Scene 8: The Find

Research was comfortable. Research she could do.

Lilith sat at her laptop—the notebooks temporarily set aside, a new mode of investigation replacing the old—and let the internet do what it did best. Academic databases. University directories. Social media traces that people forgot they'd left.

*Silas Pahlavan.*

The name had come to her in the tracking, or after it—she was never quite sure how the transition between observed knowledge and conscious awareness worked. But she knew it now, and the knowledge felt like completion. Like the final piece of a puzzle she'd been assembling for a decade.

Philosophy department. University of Manchester. Lecturer—not full professor, not yet, but the trajectory suggested he would be eventually. Publications on consciousness, phenomenology, the overlap between Eastern contemplative traditions and Western analytical approaches. The kind of work that straddled disciplines, that attracted both interest and suspicion.

She found his faculty profile first. The photograph was small, low-resolution, the kind of perfunctory image that said *this is required* rather than *I care about this*. He was looking slightly away from the camera, his expression somewhere between patience and mild annoyance.

Dark hair. Persian features—the surname made sense now, Iranian heritage probably several generations back. Eyes that were looking at something the photograph couldn't capture.

*A different face*, she noted. *Again.*

The observation caught her off guard. She'd known—had always known, at some level—that the soul she tracked wore different bodies. Different genders, different ethnicities, different ages and configurations. The recognition came through something other than appearance. 

But she hadn't quite registered, until this moment, the contrast with her own constancy.

Her face never changed. Through every past life she'd glimpsed of her own—and there were glimpses, unavoidable side effects of this kind of work—the face was the same. Her widow's peak. Her eyes. The pale crescent that appeared in her left iris when the light hit it correctly.

His face changed every time.

*What does that mean?*

She didn't know. But the question felt important in a way she couldn't quite articulate. Filed for later.

She read his publications. They were good—she could assess that even without deep expertise in the philosophy of mind. Careful, precise, unwilling to claim more than the evidence supported. He wrote about meditation practice from both inside and outside, a practitioner who was also an analyst. The combination was rare.

*How close is he?* She calculated based on what she'd felt in the tracking. *First three fetters weakening. Stream-entry within two or three years, probably sooner.*

The timeline was frighteningly short.

Eight years of tracking. Eight interventions. And now she had perhaps two years—maybe three—before he crossed the threshold she'd been approaching for eons.

If he crossed first...

She didn't complete the thought. The phrase that came to her—*together doesn't hold*—wasn't quite right, but it carried some of the weight. Only one of them could complete. One exit per... something. Per cycle. Per era. If he finished before she did, she would cycle again.

More lives. More bodies. More waiting.

But even as she formed this thought, she felt a strange doubt. The certainty that had sustained her for eight years—that their paths were mutually exclusive, that his progress was her failure—felt less solid than it once had. 

Wei's face floated up: peaceful, released, purified by the very intervention meant to corrupt her.

*What if I'm wrong about something fundamental?*

She shook off the doubt. There wasn't time for philosophical questioning. There was work to do.

She went deeper. Social media presence: minimal. He had accounts but rarely used them. A few posts about departmental events, a handful of liked articles, nothing personal. Divorced, she discovered through detective work that would have made the Noir investigator proud—a passing reference in a colleague's post, a conspicuous absence in group photos after a certain date.

No children. No current partner, as far as she could tell.

He lived alone. He meditated. He taught. He wrote.

He was approaching the threshold.

She closed the laptop and sat for a long moment in her flat, feeling the weight of everything she now knew. Outside the window, Manchester traffic moved in the patterns she'd learned to ignore.

*I found him.*

The statement should have felt triumphant. Eight years of work, finally paying off. A target identified. A strategy possible.

But what she felt, sitting alone with his photograph lingering in her mind, wasn't triumph.

It was something else. Something that made her heart rate elevate slightly—and she was too sophisticated to simply call it adrenaline. Something that made her want to look at his face again, to study the way his eyes weren't quite meeting the camera.

*Interest*, she thought. *Professional interest. He's a worthy... fellow traveler.*

She corrected the word mid-thought. Not opponent. Not target. Fellow traveler.

*He's walking the same path I'm walking. We're both approaching the same threshold.*

*And only one of us can cross.*

She found his public lecture series.

It wasn't hard—he was listed on the philosophy department's events page. A series on consciousness studies, open to the public, Tuesday evenings at seven. She could walk there from her flat.

The next lecture was in three days.

*I should observe*, she thought. *I should see him in person. Confirm what the tracking showed.*

The reasoning was perfectly sound. Tracking gave her impressions, not certainties. Seeing him live would provide data she couldn't get any other way.

Three days later, she sat in the back row of a medium-sized lecture hall, anonymous among the mix of students and public attendees. She'd dressed with more thought than she usually gave to clothing. Professional but not formal. Someone who belonged in a university setting but wasn't tied to it.

He was shorter than she'd expected.

That was her first observation—the absurd specificity of a physical body that the tracking never quite conveyed. Five-nine, maybe. Lean in the way that suggested discipline rather than deprivation. Hands that moved precisely when he spoke, each gesture intentional.

He lectured on the relationship between attention and experience. He spoke without slides, without notes, without the performative apparatus that lesser academics used to seem prepared. His voice was calm and precise—the same quality she'd noticed in his writing, translated into sound.

*He's good*, she thought, and was surprised to find she meant it without resentment.

Then he said something about the observer changing the observed, about how attention was never neutral, and she felt a shock of recognition.

*He knows.*

Not everything. Not about her, certainly. But he knew *something*—something about the nature of observation, about the way watching altered what was watched. The same thing she'd learned, in her own way, through eight years of backfires.

*Does he know he's being watched?*

She couldn't tell. His gaze moved across the audience in the practiced sweep of someone who'd been teaching for years—no particular attention to anyone, no moment of eye contact that suggested recognition.

But she felt... seen. Somehow. In a way that had nothing to do with physical sight.

After the lecture, she left before the questions began. She didn't approach him. She didn't introduce herself. She walked back to her flat through the Manchester evening, her mind churning with thoughts she hadn't quite decided how to interpret.

*First sighting*, she would later write in her notebook. *He's exactly as advanced as the tracking suggested. Perhaps more.*

*The strategy must be proximity. Trust. Relationship. I need to be close enough to...*

She paused.

*To what? To stop him? To intervene?*

*Or to understand what I might be missing?*
