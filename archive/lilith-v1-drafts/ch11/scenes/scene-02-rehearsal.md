# Scene II: Family Dinner

The restaurant held the careful warmth of places designed for occasions—low lighting, linen napkins folded into shapes that suggested attentiveness, the murmur of other diners reduced to pleasant background. A private table near the back, arranged with the precision of someone who wanted things perfect but wanted credit for not caring about perfection.

Lilith arrived to find the gathering already underway. Nadia sat at the head of the table in a draped blouse that managed to suggest both effortlessness and three hours of outfit changes. Marcus occupied the seat beside her, steady as ballast, his attention on his fiancée with the particular focus of someone who had learned when silence was service. Mother and Jeff anchored the opposite end, their chairs slightly closer together than strictly necessary—the unconscious geometry of people still learning how to be a unit. Meera had claimed the seat beside Lilith's empty chair—friend since university, close enough to the family to be included, perceptive enough to be trusted at these events.

"There you are." Nadia's voice carried across the table with a relief that edged toward accusation. "I was beginning to think you'd forgotten."

"Traffic." Lilith slid into her seat, felt her mother's hand find hers and squeeze briefly. "The ring road was a disaster."

"On a Thursday?"

"On a Thursday."

Jeff half-rose from his chair, a gesture that caught and reversed itself before completing. "Can I get you something to drink? They have a lovely—" He stopped, sat back down, hands finding the napkin in his lap. "Sorry. I'm still learning the choreography."

The smile he offered was self-deprecating in a way that invited appreciation. *Look how much I'm not overstepping. Notice how hard I'm trying.* The humility was genuine—Lilith could read that much. But it was also visible, performed for an audience that included mostly himself.

She thought, briefly, of a cell in the desert. A man who had renounced everything, including the memory of wanting to renounce.

"Water is perfect," she said. "Thank you, Jeff."

The conversation flowed in the particular rhythms of family gatherings—questions that skirted real answers, jokes that carried decades of context, the careful dance of not quite saying what anyone meant. Marcus described his best man's planned speech with the wariness of someone who had already requested extensive edits. Uncle Harold, seated near the middle with the slight displacement of someone added to the guest list late, offered unsolicited venue advice that no one acknowledged.

"The flowers are handled," Nadia was saying, her voice carrying the specific lightness of someone trying very hard to seem relaxed. "I really don't care about the flowers. I told them white, cream, whatever fits the room."

"The arrangements looked beautiful in the photos," Mother offered.

"As long as they're not yellow." Nadia's hand found her wine glass, rotated it without drinking. "Yellow photographs terribly. And nothing too tall—you want people to see each other across the table. But otherwise, I really don't care."

Marcus caught Lilith's eye. The micro-expression was there and gone—a shared acknowledgment of the thing neither would name aloud. Every denial of preference was its own preference. The performance of not-caring was its own kind of grasping.

"I'm sure it will be lovely," Lilith said.

Mother leaned forward, began to speak, then visibly caught herself. Her mouth closed around words that rearranged themselves before emerging.

"This is Nadia's night," she said instead, folding her hands with deliberate placement. "I'm just here to enjoy watching everything come together."

Uncle Harold laughed—a sound with more edge than humor. "Since when do you hold back?"

"Since I learned." Mother's smile was careful, practiced, aimed at the space between sincerity and performance. It landed somewhere in no man's land.

Jeff's hand covered hers on the tablecloth. The gesture was meant to be supportive, and was, and also wanted to be noticed being supportive—the layers of intention visible to anyone who knew to look.

Everyone, Lilith observed, was renouncing something. Everyone was performing their restraint and wanting credit for the performance. The chill bride. The hands-off mother. The humble stepfather still learning his place.

Meera caught her eye from across the table—a glance that carried the particular solidarity of someone who knew all the players and appreciated the choreography. *You seeing this?* the look said. *All of them.* Lilith allowed herself a small smile in return. It was good to have a witness.

It was Macarius in a Manchester restaurant. All of them reaching for recognition in spaces designed to deny it.

The thought passed through her attention without catching. She reached for her water glass.

"So," Nadia said, and the word carried the slight charge of something that had been waiting to surface. "Are you bringing anyone, Lil? To the wedding?"

"Not planning to."

"Not that researcher from the conference? Mother said you mentioned someone."

Lilith felt her mother's attention sharpen beside her, the particular quality of maternal curiosity dressed as casual interest.

"That was months ago. It was nothing."

"It didn't sound like nothing."

"It was very much something for about three weeks, and then it was nothing." Lilith kept her voice light. "You know how it is."

Nadia studied her across the table. The restaurant's warm lighting caught her sister's face in a way that made her look younger, or perhaps just more vulnerable—the bride-to-be stripped for a moment of the performance.

"You're always somewhere else, aren't you?" Nadia said. "Even when you're here."

Lilith's hand paused around her glass. "What do you mean?"

"You're so good at showing up. At being calm and together and—" Nadia gestured, a small wave that seemed to encompass all of Lilith's competence. "—present. But there's this thing you're always thinking about. Always." She shrugged, the motion not quite matching the weight of the observation. "What is it?"

The table had gone quiet. Marcus found something interesting in his napkin. Mother's attention had sharpened further, the smile still present but no longer connected to its surroundings. Jeff sat very still, manifesting the particular invisibility of people who understood they were not part of this conversation.

"Work, mostly." Lilith's voice remained warm, easy—the register she used with patients when closing a topic. "Research. The things that keep me up at night are unfortunately not very interesting dinner conversation."

Nadia held her gaze a beat longer than casual. Something moved behind her eyes—not suspicion, exactly. Something closer to sisterly recognition, the kind that bypassed explanation.

"Promise me you'll actually be at my wedding," she said. "Not just physically."

"I promise."

The words came without hesitation, without cost. A commitment that required nothing to make because Lilith could not, at this moment, see what keeping it would require.

The conversation resumed its flow. Uncle Harold told a story about a wedding venue disaster. Jeff refilled wine glasses with visible pleasure. Mother squeezed Lilith's hand again as the evening wound toward its natural conclusion—a gesture of connection that asked for nothing except to be felt.

At the curb outside, after the hugs and the promises, Lilith stood for a moment in Manchester's evening air. The rain had stopped, leaving the streets with that particular shine of wet pavement reflecting sodium lights.

The dinner had been a success. Everyone had performed their roles well—their humility, their restraint, their presence.

She thought briefly of Macarius in his cell. Wondered, not quite consciously, what her own performance cost.

Then the thought passed. The tracking was waiting.

She walked toward home through streets that held the day's retreating warmth, her mind already turning toward the notebooks in her flat, toward the threads she had been following through lifetimes she had witnessed and shaped.

Somewhere behind her, a restaurant began clearing a table where a family had gathered to perform coming together. And somewhere ahead, a desert father lay in the dark of his cell, reaching toward color and texture and warmth, his hands grasping for everything he had spent fifteen years learning to release.

She did not see the connection. She was not looking.
