# Scene VI: Closing

Lilith made tea. The kettle's whistle was the only sound in the flat, sharp against the quiet that had gathered through hours of tracking.

She drank standing at the window, watching Manchester's lights scatter and dim as the hour deepened. The rain had returned at some point—she couldn't say when—and now fell steadily, turning the streetlamps into blurred aureoles of amber and white.

The tracking was finished for tonight. The documentation could wait until morning.

Her hands had stopped trembling. The headache had receded to a dull presence rather than a pulse. These physical costs—she noted them without concern. Powers had costs. Abilities exacted prices. This was how it had always been for those who could do what she did.

The tea warmed her throat, and she let her attention settle on the city below. Somewhere out there, the dinner guests had returned to their separate performances. Nadia was probably lying awake, running through wedding details she was pretending not to care about. Mother was making notes she would never share. Jeff was finding his place in a family that hadn't asked for him but was learning to make room.

And Macarius was dust in a desert cell, his reaching hands finally at rest.

What connected them? The question surfaced and she let it pass. Not everything needed an answer. Not everything needed examination.

But something lingered.

*Together doesn't hold*—the insight from an earlier tracking, still unexamined.

The recurring parallel—his attachment mirroring something in her, something she hadn't named.

The pattern of backfire—every intervention accelerating rather than impeding.

She filed these. Data points. Observations worth revisiting when there was time.

There was never time.

The Heian thread waited. A courtier surrounded by beauty, learning to feel everything Macarius denied. The next configuration in the endless chain. The next opportunity.

Lilith set down her cup. The ceramic made a small sound against the counter, precise and final.

She moved toward her bedroom with the particular tiredness that came from work the body didn't fully understand—hours spent motionless while consciousness ranged across centuries. Tomorrow would bring more patients, more clinical work, more of the ordinary architecture that made her extraordinary activities possible.

The notebooks rested in their corner, waiting for what came next.

The threads hummed at the edge of perception.

In the bathroom, washing her face, she caught her reflection again: the shadows beneath her eyes slightly deeper than they had been this morning, the pallor that might mean nothing or might mean the beginning of something. She observed without judgment, dried her face, moved on.

She slept—or approximated sleep, that particular stillness she had learned that served the body's purposes without fully releasing consciousness. Part of her remained aware, always, of the patterns she tracked and the interventions she planned.

Morning would arrive. The work would continue.

As always. Until it didn't.

Beyond the window, rain continued to fall on Manchester, on the streets she walked and the buildings she passed, on a city that remained oblivious to the woman in its midst who reached across centuries like others reached across rooms.

Somewhere in the past, a desert cell held only stone and memory.

Somewhere in the future—or elsewhere in the past—a courtier in silk was learning to feel with an intensity that would become its own prison.

And somewhere in the threshold between waking and sleep, Lilith Azami filed another chapter of a pursuit she could not abandon, her certainty unexamined, her pattern unrecognized, her reaching hands no different, in the end, than those of the hermit she had judged.

But that parallel remained undrawn.

The night continued. The rain fell. The threads hummed.

And the work—the work that was becoming her, or perhaps had been all along—waited for morning.
