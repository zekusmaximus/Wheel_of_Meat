# Scene 6: CODA — The Search Begins

The next evening, Lilith returned to her tracking corner with a different intention. Not observation—she'd done enough of that. Not intervention—seven years had taught her the futility of working through the past.

This was reconnaissance. A forward search to trace the thread from Renaissance France to wherever it landed in her time.

She'd spent the day at the clinic going through familiar motions—sessions with patients, documentation, a brief conversation with Harrow about scheduling next month's supervision hours. The ordinary architecture of professional life, maintained on autopilot while the real work waited at home.

Now, with Manchester settling into evening darkness outside her windows, she closed her eyes and reached for the tracking state.

The thread she'd followed backward for seven years could also be followed forward—though the technique was different. Scanning rather than deep immersion. Touching points along the timeline rather than inhabiting them fully. Looking for where Jean's final question would manifest into flesh.

*If I can die for honest uncertainty, what can I die for with conviction?*

The answer would take shape somewhere. Someone seeking a cause that deserved absolute commitment. Someone who would learn what Jean had died needing to understand.

Lilith let her consciousness thin, scanning forward from 1588. Decades passed in flickers. The thread moved through death and dissolution and the space between incarnations where consciousness reorganized itself for the next attempt.

Then—there. China. The 1850s, though the exact year was harder to pinpoint from this distance. The thread stirring, gathering coherence, taking shape around historical chaos.

She focused her attention and caught glimpses:

A young man. Late teens or early twenties. The details were fragmentary, imprecise—the forward scan didn't offer the same clarity as backward tracking, showed tendency and direction rather than specific narrative.

But she could sense the shape of what was forming:

**Conviction** born from Jean's doubt resolution. The capacity to commit fully, learned through watching uncertainty become integrity.

**Willingness to sacrifice** for something larger. The question Jean had died asking, now finding its answer in someone prepared to give everything for a cause that mattered.

**The Taiping Rebellion** as crucible. Religious fervor channeled into armed uprising. Chaos and violence and the terrible clarity that came from fighting for what you believed deserved your life.

The glimpses were enough. This was the next incarnation—Chapter 18 in the sequence she'd been following. The bridge between Renaissance skepticism and whatever came after.

Lilith withdrew partially from the scan, making notes in her tracking journal:

*Next incarnation: China, c. 1850-1864. Taiping Rebellion era. Male, late teens-early twenties. Central question: what deserves certain commitment? Learning through commitment's cost.*

She would need to return to this, track it more completely, understand how the lesson developed and where it led. But not tonight. Tonight was about confirming the path existed—that she could trace forward from Jean through the Taiping rebel to whatever came next.

And next would be... what? She scanned further forward, trying to catch the thread as it moved beyond the mid-1800s.

Fragments:

Another death. The Taiping incarnation dying for the cause he'd found—but whether that death taught what it needed to or became another backfire, she couldn't tell from this distance.

Then: reformation. Late 1800s? Early 1900s? The timeline blurred. Somewhere in that range, another life beginning. Western context this time—she could sense it in the thread's texture, though the specifics remained unclear.

And after that...

She pushed further, trying to catch the thread as it approached her era. The scan became harder to maintain—looking too far forward strained the tracking in ways that backward observation didn't. Like trying to see through fog that thickened with every step.

But there, at the edge of perception—

A spark. Modern era. Recent. Possibly alive right now, in her time, in her world.

Lilith's breath caught. Her Manchester body went very still, awareness split between the tracking trance and the physical present.

He was here. Somewhere. The soul she'd been tracking through seven years and countless lifetimes had landed in her era, close enough to touch if she could just narrow the search from "modern world" to specific location, specific person, specific life that could be found and approached and engaged with directly.

The technical problem clarified: she needed to trace the intermediate incarnations. The Taiping rebel would lead to the next, and that to the next, until the thread landed precisely in the present rather than vaguely in "her time."

Weeks of work. Maybe months. Careful tracking, patient observation, building the map from Renaissance France to modern Manchester step by life by death by rebirth.

But it was possible. The thread existed. He existed. Somewhere close—close enough that the tracking could sense him even if it couldn't yet pinpoint him.

Lilith released the scan entirely and returned to her flat, to her body, to the ordinary present moment that suddenly felt charged with different possibilities.

Dawn was approaching—she'd been tracking through the night again, hours passing unnoticed while consciousness wandered through time. The window showed Manchester's sky beginning to pale, that particular gray-blue that came before sunrise when the city was still quiet but no longer quite dark.

She stood, feeling the stiffness in her joints from sitting motionless. Stretched. Made tea while the kettle's sound filled the kitchen with its ordinary promise that heat could be transferred, that water could change states, that the world followed reliable patterns even when consciousness didn't.

The tea steamed in her hands as she returned to the tracking corner and looked at her notebooks. Seven years of observation. Seven interventions. Seven backfires. And now—a completely different approach.

Find him in the present.

The decision had solidified overnight, moving from strategic pivot to settled fact. She would trace the thread forward, life by life, until it landed in a name and a face and a location she could actually reach. Then she would engineer a meeting. Become part of his life. Position herself close enough to intervene not from centuries away but from across a room, a table, a conversation where she could see his face and he could see hers for the first time in this timeline.

The thought carried something she didn't quite want to examine—not excitement, which would be too simple, but a kind of anticipation that included uncertainty about whether she was preparing for battle or something else entirely.

She drank her tea as dawn light strengthened outside, washing the city in gradations of gray and gold. Somewhere out there, in one of those buildings or streets or ordinary spaces where people lived their unremarkable lives, he was waking up. Going to work. Moving through a day that would seem perfectly normal because he didn't know yet that someone had been tracking him through history and was finally, after seven years of distance, preparing to close the gap.

Chapter 1 was three years away—that's when they'd be lovers, when she'd confess, when the final intervention would begin. But before she could get there, she needed to find him. Learn his name. Discover where he worked, where he lived, what ordinary life he'd built in the brief decades between birth and the moment she'd appear in it.

The work would take time. But time was something she had, even if patience was something she'd been running short on.

Lilith finished her tea, rinsed the cup, and prepared for another day at the clinic. The tracking would continue tomorrow night. And the night after. And for however many nights it took to follow the thread from Taiping China through whatever came next until it landed precisely where she needed it.

In the doorway, she paused and looked back at her tracking corner. The notebooks stacked carefully. The space that had consumed seven years while yielding nothing except the knowledge that what she'd been doing wouldn't work.

Seven years of one approach ending.

Something new beginning.

She left for work as the city woke around her, and carried the decision with her like a weight that might be burden or might be ballast—she couldn't tell yet which, and wouldn't know until she'd followed the thread to its conclusion and discovered what proximity taught that distance had concealed.

The search had begun.

The distance was closing.

And somewhere in Manchester, unknowing and unaware, he continued the life he'd been living while she prepared to step into it.

Three years until Chapter 1.

But first—finding him.

The work continued.
