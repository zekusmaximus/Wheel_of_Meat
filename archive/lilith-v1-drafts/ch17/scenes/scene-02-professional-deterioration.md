# Scene 2: Professional Deterioration

The last patient left at four-thirty. Lilith closed the file, made her notes with the mechanical precision of someone who had written thousands of clinical summaries, and sat for a moment in the quiet office watching the afternoon fade into early evening.

Her computer screen glowed with the patient management system, reminders pulsing in the corner about documentation deadlines and mandatory training modules. She should complete the forms. She should watch the video on updated safeguarding protocols. She should respond to the three emails from admin about scheduling conflicts next month.

Instead, she opened a new browser tab.

The search bar waited, cursor blinking. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard for a moment before typing: *clinical psychology positions manchester university*.

The results loaded. Three open positions at the University of Manchester—one in student services, one attached to the medical school, one joint appointment between the psychology department and counseling services. She clicked through to the first listing, scanned the requirements. Doctoral degree in clinical psychology. Check. Three years post-qualification experience. She had seven. Teaching experience preferred but not required.

The job description detailed responsibilities: clinical work with university population, supervision of doctoral students, possible teaching contribution to undergraduate psychology courses. Hours flexible. Research expectations moderate.

Something in her chest shifted—not excitement, which would have been too clean an emotion for the exhaustion that had been accumulating for years—but a kind of recognition. A sense of a door she hadn't quite noticed was there until someone mentioned it might be open.

She clicked to the application portal, which prompted for a login she didn't have. The registration form asked for basic information: name, current position, institution, area of specialization.

She filled in the first two fields, then stopped.

This was speculation. Idle browsing. The kind of thing people did when they were vaguely dissatisfied with their current position but not actively planning to leave. She had patients here. Colleagues who depended on her. A supervisor who had become, if not warm, at least professionally respectful after the complaint review years ago.

She closed the tab.

Then opened it again.

The form still waited, half-completed. She looked at it for a long moment—the cursor blinking in the third field, asking where she currently worked—before closing the browser entirely.

A knock on her door. She looked up to find Harrow standing in the doorway, folder in hand, expression carrying the particular neutrality that meant he wanted something but was trying not to frame it as a demand.

"Dr. Azami. Do you have a moment?"

She gestured to the chair Alex had vacated an hour earlier. "Of course."

Harrow sat with the economy of movement that characterized everything he did—efficient, precise, revealing nothing about the person performing the actions. He opened the folder, glanced at whatever was inside, then looked up at her with eyes that were harder to read than they used to be.

"I've been reviewing caseload distributions," he said. "You're carrying more hours than anyone else in the department. Twenty-eight patients active, plus supervision responsibilities."

"The work is manageable." Which was true in the sense that she was managing it, though what the management cost her was a separate question.

"Perhaps." Harrow's tone suggested he didn't believe her but was too professional to say so directly. "But Dr. Chen mentioned you haven't taken leave in..." He consulted the folder. "Eighteen months. Before that, three days for a family wedding. Before that, nothing for two years."

Lilith felt something tighten in her shoulders—the same tension that had been there all afternoon, now sharpening into something that required conscious effort not to show. "I prefer to work."

"I'm sure you do." Harrow closed the folder, set it on his lap with deliberate care. "But I'm obligated to ensure staff wellbeing, which includes preventing burnout before it becomes a crisis." He paused, the kind of pause that gave weight to what came next. "I'd like you to consider taking extended leave. Two weeks minimum. Four would be better."

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead. Outside the window, Manchester's early evening traffic created a low ambient sound—cars and buses and the occasional siren, the ordinary noise of a city moving from work to home to whatever came after.

"I'll think about it," Lilith said, which was the answer that would end the conversation without committing to anything.

Harrow studied her for a moment, and something in his expression suggested he was seeing more than she wanted him to. "You're an excellent clinician, Dr. Azami. I don't say that lightly, given our... earlier interactions." He stood, folder tucked under his arm. "But excellent clinicians burn out just like everyone else. Sometimes faster, because they don't recognize when they're running on fumes."

He left without waiting for a response, which was a kindness Lilith recognized even if she didn't particularly want it.

She sat in the quiet office and listened to the building settle around her. Footsteps in the hallway, voices saying goodbye, the distant sound of doors closing as people left for the evening. The ordinary exodus of a workplace at the end of a day, everyone returning to lives that presumably felt more real than this fluorescent-lit holding pattern.

Her computer screen had gone dark. She moved the mouse, waking it, and the browser reopened to the last page she'd been viewing—the university position, application form still half-completed.

The cursor blinked in the institutional affiliation field.

She could fill it out. Submit the application. See what happened. The worst outcome would be nothing—no interview, no change, continuing exactly as she had been. The best outcome would be... what? A different office? Different patients? A teaching load that might excuse the preoccupation that everyone had started noticing?

But it wouldn't solve the actual problem. The tracking would continue whether she worked at the NHS or the university. The interventions would keep backfiring. The seven-year pattern would extend to eight, nine, ten, stretching forward into however long it took her to either succeed or admit that success wasn't possible through the methods she'd been using.

She logged out of the computer without completing the form.

Her bag sat by the door, the same worn leather satchel she'd carried for years, holding the same items everyone carried—keys, wallet, phone, the detritus of a professional life. And beneath those ordinary objects: notebooks. The small ones she used for tracking observations, filled with handwriting that no one else would recognize as documenting anything more significant than research notes.

She stood, feeling the stiffness in her lower back from too many hours sitting. Gathered her things. Locked the office door behind her.

The hallway was mostly empty now, just a few stragglers finishing paperwork or having quiet conversations in doorways. She walked past them with a nod, not stopping to chat, and made her way to the exit.

Outside, the air was cool and smelled of rain though none was falling. The sky had gone purple-gray, that particular color that came in autumn when day ended but night hadn't quite committed. She walked to her car through the mostly empty car park, unlocked it, sat in the driver's seat without starting the engine.

Harrow was right. She was burning out. Had been burning out for years, the slow consumption of a candle that kept going because there was still wax left even when the flame was eating more wick than it should.

But taking leave wouldn't help. What she needed wasn't rest—it was a completely different approach to the problem that had consumed seven years while yielding nothing except the opposite of what she intended.

She started the car. The radio came on, some news program discussing politics she hadn't been following. She turned it off and drove home through traffic that was heavy but not impossible, everyone returning to their separate lives at the ordinary speed of a Tuesday evening.

Her flat would be waiting. The tracking corner would be waiting. The notebooks would be waiting.

And tonight, she would continue the work that had consumed her, because stopping felt impossible even when continuing felt futile.

But the application form lingered in her mind, half-completed, waiting in a browser tab she'd never quite closed.
