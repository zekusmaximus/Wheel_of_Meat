# Scene 1: The University Student

The clinic smelled of disinfectant and the particular staleness of air that had been recycled too many times. Lilith sat in her office, the afternoon light filtered gray through windows that hadn't been cleaned in months, and watched the graduate student across from her fold and unfold the corner of their intake form.

Twenty-four. Philosophy doctoral candidate. The form listed "inability to complete thesis" as the presenting concern, which was both accurate and insufficient in the way that intake forms always were.

"I can't write it." The student—Alex, they'd asked to be called—spoke with the careful precision of someone who had rehearsed this explanation. "Every time I make a claim, I can see all the ways it could be wrong. Every argument has a counter-argument. Every position assumes something I can't prove."

Lilith's hands rested on the arms of her chair, fingers loose. Seven years ago she might have leaned forward here, signaling engagement. Now she maintained the posture through discipline rather than instinct—the small muscles between her shoulder blades complained about the hours she'd spent motionless in her tracking corner the night before.

"Tell me about the last time you tried to write," she said.

Alex's fingers moved to their collar, adjusting it though it sat perfectly straight. "Yesterday. I was working on the second chapter—epistemological foundations. I wrote three paragraphs about justified true belief. Then I read them and saw every hole. Gettier cases. The regress problem. The question of whether justification can ever be non-circular." They looked up, eyes red-rimmed in a way that suggested more than one sleepless night. "How do you commit to a position when you can't be certain?"

The question landed in Lilith's chest with more weight than it should have. She kept her face neutral—the professional mask still fit, even when the person wearing it had spent the previous seven years engaged in a project that yielded nothing but failures she couldn't explain to anyone.

"What does your supervisor say?" she asked.

"That I'm overthinking it. That philosophy doctoral candidates are supposed to make arguments, not achieve absolute certainty." Alex's laugh held no lightness. "But that feels like... like pretending. Like I'm supposed to just ignore the fact that I could be completely wrong."

The afternoon sun shifted, catching dust motes in the air between them. Lilith noticed the university logo on Alex's folder—Manchester Metropolitan, the philosophy department. She had driven past that building last week on her way to work, had noted the gothic architecture and the students scattered on the green outside with the particular attention she'd been giving to university spaces lately without quite acknowledging why.

"Let me ask you something," Lilith said. "In your research, have you encountered any philosophical position that doesn't have critics? Any argument that everyone accepts?"

"No."

"And yet people still write philosophy. Still submit theses. Still get their doctorates and publish and contribute to the field." She shifted in her chair, redistributing weight off her left hip where tension had been building. "What do you think they know that you don't?"

Alex frowned, the kind of frown that meant they were actually thinking rather than deflecting. "Maybe they're just... better at ignoring the problems?"

"Or maybe they've learned something about the relationship between truthfulness and certainty." Lilith's voice stayed calm, clinical, even as the words echoed something she'd been circling for months without quite grasping. "You can write 'I observed this pattern. I cannot verify that interpretation. Based on the available evidence, here's what I'm claiming while acknowledging what I cannot prove.' That's not pretending. That's intellectual honesty."

"But what if I'm wrong?"

"What if being wrong with integrity is more valuable than being silent?" The question came out sharper than she'd intended—not harsh, but carrying an edge that had been honed on seven years of interventions that backfired in ways she was only now beginning to understand.

Alex blinked. Sat back. Their hand dropped from their collar to their lap.

"I hadn't thought about it that way," they said quietly.

Lilith felt the small shift in the room—the particular quality that sessions sometimes achieved when something landed. She'd been good at this once, before the tracking had started consuming the hours that normal people used for sleep. She was still good at it, technically. The skills remained even when the attention that sustained them had been redirected elsewhere.

"The alternative to acting under uncertainty isn't certainty," she continued, her voice gentling. "It's paralysis. You can acknowledge your limits while still taking action. You can submit a thesis that says 'this is what I've found, and here's what I still don't know' and let the examiners engage with that honest uncertainty."

Alex nodded slowly. "That makes sense. I think I can—" They paused. "Do you ever have that problem? Not being able to move forward because you can't be sure?"

The question hung in the air between them. Lilith's thumb pressed against the armrest, finding a small imperfection in the leather that she'd worn smooth over the past three years.

"I think everyone struggles with uncertainty," she said, which was true and also a deflection that Alex was too polite or too absorbed in their own crisis to interrogate. "The question is what you do with it."

She could see Alex filing this away, integrating it into whatever internal framework they'd built to make sense of their paralysis. The session continued—practical strategies for breaking through the block, cognitive techniques for managing the anxiety that accompanied uncertainty, a plan for the coming week that included actual writing rather than endless revision.

But Lilith's attention had snagged on something Alex had said earlier. The philosophy department. The university structure. The way clinical psychologists sometimes held joint appointments, teaching seminars while maintaining a reduced patient load.

She made a note on her pad about Alex's homework assignment, and beneath it, almost unconsciously, wrote: *University positions—teaching + clinical?*

Then she crossed it out.

The session ended with Alex looking lighter than when they'd arrived, which was the point of the work even when the person doing the work was herself paralyzed by a problem she couldn't solve through any method she'd tried. They thanked her, scheduled a follow-up for two weeks out, and left.

Lilith sat in the empty office and felt the familiar weight settle back into her shoulders. The afternoon light had shifted again, throwing shadows across her desk. In three hours she would go home. In four hours she would sit in her tracking corner and continue the work that had consumed seven years while achieving nothing except the opposite of what she intended.

But first: two more patients. A supervision meeting. The ordinary architecture of a life that felt increasingly like a performance she maintained out of habit rather than conviction.

She stood, stretched the stiffness from her lower back, and checked the schedule for her next appointment. The tension between her shoulder blades remained. It had been there for months now, a physical reminder that the body kept score even when the mind tried to ignore the accounting.

The next patient would arrive in ten minutes. Enough time to make tea. Enough time to settle back into the professional persona that, unlike her cosmic project, still seemed to function the way it was supposed to.

She left the office and walked to the break room, where the fluorescent lights hummed with a frequency that had started bothering her sometime in the last year. Dr. Chen was making coffee, looking exhausted in the way that suggested a difficult morning.

"Long day?" Lilith asked, filling the electric kettle.

Chen glanced up, and something in her expression shifted—concern dressed as casual inquiry. "I was going to ask you the same thing. You look tired."

"Just the usual," Lilith said, which was both true and profoundly insufficient.

"The usual has been looking more exhausting lately." Chen leaned against the counter, coffee cup warming her hands. "How long since you took any leave?"

Lilith tried to remember. The question should have had an easy answer—a specific date, a memorable vacation—but the past seven years had blurred into an undifferentiated stretch of work and tracking and work again, with nothing that resembled actual rest.

"I don't know," she admitted. "A while."

"You should consider it." Chen's voice carried genuine warmth, the kind that came from actually caring rather than professional obligation. "Even just a week. The work will still be here when you get back."

Lilith nodded, made a noncommittal sound that could mean anything, and focused on her tea. The kettle clicked off. She poured water over the bag and watched the color bleed into clarity, the small transformation that happened every time and still held a fragment of something worth noticing.

Chen left with her coffee and a reminder about a staff meeting next Tuesday. Lilith stayed in the break room, tea steaming in her hands, and looked out the window at the city beyond. Somewhere out there, the university stood with its gothic architecture and its philosophy department and its students wrestling with the same uncertainty that had paralyzed Alex.

Somewhere out there, seven years of tracking had brought her no closer to understanding how to stop what she'd been trying to stop, or why every intervention accelerated rather than impeded, or what the pattern meant that she could see clearly in her patients but not in herself.

She drank her tea standing up. It burned her tongue slightly, which at least was a sensation that made sense—pain as the natural consequence of impatience, heat as a thing that could be waited for and wasn't.

The next patient would be here soon. She had work to do. The ordinary kind, where the outcomes followed predictable patterns and her expertise actually helped rather than making things worse.

She finished her tea, rinsed the cup, and walked back to her office to prepare for the rest of the afternoon.
# Scene 2: Professional Deterioration

The last patient left at four-thirty. Lilith closed the file, made her notes with the mechanical precision of someone who had written thousands of clinical summaries, and sat for a moment in the quiet office watching the afternoon fade into early evening.

Her computer screen glowed with the patient management system, reminders pulsing in the corner about documentation deadlines and mandatory training modules. She should complete the forms. She should watch the video on updated safeguarding protocols. She should respond to the three emails from admin about scheduling conflicts next month.

Instead, she opened a new browser tab.

The search bar waited, cursor blinking. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard for a moment before typing: *clinical psychology positions manchester university*.

The results loaded. Three open positions at the University of Manchester—one in student services, one attached to the medical school, one joint appointment between the psychology department and counseling services. She clicked through to the first listing, scanned the requirements. Doctoral degree in clinical psychology. Check. Three years post-qualification experience. She had seven. Teaching experience preferred but not required.

The job description detailed responsibilities: clinical work with university population, supervision of doctoral students, possible teaching contribution to undergraduate psychology courses. Hours flexible. Research expectations moderate.

Something in her chest shifted—not excitement, which would have been too clean an emotion for the exhaustion that had been accumulating for years—but a kind of recognition. A sense of a door she hadn't quite noticed was there until someone mentioned it might be open.

She clicked to the application portal, which prompted for a login she didn't have. The registration form asked for basic information: name, current position, institution, area of specialization.

She filled in the first two fields, then stopped.

This was speculation. Idle browsing. The kind of thing people did when they were vaguely dissatisfied with their current position but not actively planning to leave. She had patients here. Colleagues who depended on her. A supervisor who had become, if not warm, at least professionally respectful after the complaint review years ago.

She closed the tab.

Then opened it again.

The form still waited, half-completed. She looked at it for a long moment—the cursor blinking in the third field, asking where she currently worked—before closing the browser entirely.

A knock on her door. She looked up to find Harrow standing in the doorway, folder in hand, expression carrying the particular neutrality that meant he wanted something but was trying not to frame it as a demand.

"Dr. Azami. Do you have a moment?"

She gestured to the chair Alex had vacated an hour earlier. "Of course."

Harrow sat with the economy of movement that characterized everything he did—efficient, precise, revealing nothing about the person performing the actions. He opened the folder, glanced at whatever was inside, then looked up at her with eyes that were harder to read than they used to be.

"I've been reviewing caseload distributions," he said. "You're carrying more hours than anyone else in the department. Twenty-eight patients active, plus supervision responsibilities."

"The work is manageable." Which was true in the sense that she was managing it, though what the management cost her was a separate question.

"Perhaps." Harrow's tone suggested he didn't believe her but was too professional to say so directly. "But Dr. Chen mentioned you haven't taken leave in..." He consulted the folder. "Eighteen months. Before that, three days for a family wedding. Before that, nothing for two years."

Lilith felt something tighten in her shoulders—the same tension that had been there all afternoon, now sharpening into something that required conscious effort not to show. "I prefer to work."

"I'm sure you do." Harrow closed the folder, set it on his lap with deliberate care. "But I'm obligated to ensure staff wellbeing, which includes preventing burnout before it becomes a crisis." He paused, the kind of pause that gave weight to what came next. "I'd like you to consider taking extended leave. Two weeks minimum. Four would be better."

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead. Outside the window, Manchester's early evening traffic created a low ambient sound—cars and buses and the occasional siren, the ordinary noise of a city moving from work to home to whatever came after.

"I'll think about it," Lilith said, which was the answer that would end the conversation without committing to anything.

Harrow studied her for a moment, and something in his expression suggested he was seeing more than she wanted him to. "You're an excellent clinician, Dr. Azami. I don't say that lightly, given our... earlier interactions." He stood, folder tucked under his arm. "But excellent clinicians burn out just like everyone else. Sometimes faster, because they don't recognize when they're running on fumes."

He left without waiting for a response, which was a kindness Lilith recognized even if she didn't particularly want it.

She sat in the quiet office and listened to the building settle around her. Footsteps in the hallway, voices saying goodbye, the distant sound of doors closing as people left for the evening. The ordinary exodus of a workplace at the end of a day, everyone returning to lives that presumably felt more real than this fluorescent-lit holding pattern.

Her computer screen had gone dark. She moved the mouse, waking it, and the browser reopened to the last page she'd been viewing—the university position, application form still half-completed.

The cursor blinked in the institutional affiliation field.

She could fill it out. Submit the application. See what happened. The worst outcome would be nothing—no interview, no change, continuing exactly as she had been. The best outcome would be... what? A different office? Different patients? A teaching load that might excuse the preoccupation that everyone had started noticing?

But it wouldn't solve the actual problem. The tracking would continue whether she worked at the NHS or the university. The interventions would keep backfiring. The seven-year pattern would extend to eight, nine, ten, stretching forward into however long it took her to either succeed or admit that success wasn't possible through the methods she'd been using.

She logged out of the computer without completing the form.

Her bag sat by the door, the same worn leather satchel she'd carried for years, holding the same items everyone carried—keys, wallet, phone, the detritus of a professional life. And beneath those ordinary objects: notebooks. The small ones she used for tracking observations, filled with handwriting that no one else would recognize as documenting anything more significant than research notes.

She stood, feeling the stiffness in her lower back from too many hours sitting. Gathered her things. Locked the office door behind her.

The hallway was mostly empty now, just a few stragglers finishing paperwork or having quiet conversations in doorways. She walked past them with a nod, not stopping to chat, and made her way to the exit.

Outside, the air was cool and smelled of rain though none was falling. The sky had gone purple-gray, that particular color that came in autumn when day ended but night hadn't quite committed. She walked to her car through the mostly empty car park, unlocked it, sat in the driver's seat without starting the engine.

Harrow was right. She was burning out. Had been burning out for years, the slow consumption of a candle that kept going because there was still wax left even when the flame was eating more wick than it should.

But taking leave wouldn't help. What she needed wasn't rest—it was a completely different approach to the problem that had consumed seven years while yielding nothing except the opposite of what she intended.

She started the car. The radio came on, some news program discussing politics she hadn't been following. She turned it off and drove home through traffic that was heavy but not impossible, everyone returning to their separate lives at the ordinary speed of a Tuesday evening.

Her flat would be waiting. The tracking corner would be waiting. The notebooks would be waiting.

And tonight, she would continue the work that had consumed her, because stopping felt impossible even when continuing felt futile.

But the application form lingered in her mind, half-completed, waiting in a browser tab she'd never quite closed.
# Scene 3: The Loneliness of Knowledge

Lilith drove home through traffic that thinned as she left the city center, the familiar route requiring no conscious attention. Her mind drifted—not to the tracking, not yet, but to the empty evening ahead and the phone that had buzzed twice during her last session.

She pulled into her building's car park, gathered her bag, and checked the messages as she walked to the entrance.

**Meera:** *Coffee tomorrow? Been too long xx*

**Meera:** *Also you didn't respond to my last three texts so I'm choosing to believe your phone died rather than you're avoiding me*

Lilith felt something that might have been guilt if she examined it closely enough—a small uncomfortable awareness that normal friendships required maintenance she'd been neglecting. She typed a response as she climbed the stairs to her flat.

**Lilith:** *Coffee sounds good. Tomorrow at 3?*

The reply came before she'd unlocked her door.

**Meera:** *Perfect. The place near yours. And bring your appetite, you look like you've been living on air*

Lilith paused, phone in hand. She hadn't seen Meera in person for... months? The last time had been Nadia's wedding, and before that, her own birthday gathering. The gaps between meetings had been widening without her quite noticing, the way things eroded through accumulation rather than any single decisive break.

She went inside, dropped her bag by the tracking corner, and stood in the flat's stillness for a moment. The space felt exactly as it had that morning—unchanged, waiting, patient in the way that inanimate objects could be patient because time meant nothing to them.

Her stomach reminded her she hadn't eaten since the sandwich she'd grabbed at noon. She made toast, ate it standing at the kitchen counter, and answered a text from Nadia about holiday plans she had no energy to think about.

Then she sat in her tracking corner and worked until midnight.

---

The coffee shop Meera had chosen was the same one they'd been meeting at for years—small, locally owned, the kind of place that made genuinely good coffee without requiring anyone to perform enthusiasm about it. Lilith arrived five minutes early and ordered tea, claiming a table by the window where afternoon light fell in squares across the worn wood.

Meera came in precisely on time, spotted Lilith immediately, and crossed the room with the easy confidence of someone who moved through the world without the weight of knowledge that couldn't be shared. She was wearing scrubs under her jacket—she must have come straight from her shift at the hospital.

"There you are." Meera dropped into the opposite chair, pulled Lilith into a brief fierce hug before sitting back. "I was starting to think you'd moved cities without telling anyone."

"Just busy." Which was true and profoundly insufficient, the same deflection Lilith had been using for years.

"Busy." Meera's tone made the word sound like an accusation, though not an unkind one. "You know that's what people say when they don't want to admit they're drowning, right?"

The barista called Meera's name. She retrieved her coffee—something dark and complicated that involved extra shots—and returned to the table with eyes that were too perceptive for Lilith's comfort.

"I'm not drowning," Lilith said.

"No?" Meera sipped her coffee, grimaced slightly at the heat. "Because you've lost weight. And you've got those shadows under your eyes that say you're not sleeping. And the last time we had an actual conversation was..." She paused, calculating. "March? April?"

"I've been working on a research project."

"The mysterious research project you never talk about." Meera set her cup down with enough force to make the table vibrate slightly. "Lil, I say this with love: whatever you're researching is eating you alive."

Outside the window, Manchester moved through its afternoon routine—people walking dogs, students with backpacks, a delivery van double-parked with its hazards blinking. The ordinary motion of a world where everyone carried their own concerns and none of them involved seven years of interventions that backfired in ways that suggested the universe itself was structured to prevent what she was attempting.

"It's important work," Lilith said quietly.

"I don't doubt that." Meera's voice gentled. "But important work that destroys you isn't worth it. And don't give me that look—you know I'm right."

Lilith looked at her hands, wrapped around the tea cup that had gone lukewarm while they talked. Meera was right, in the way that people who stood outside a situation could be right about its unsustainability without understanding why stopping felt impossible.

"I just need to..." What? Finish something that showed no signs of finishing? Find a method that worked when every method had failed? Stop pursuing a goal that felt more essential than breathing? "I'm close to understanding something."

"Understanding what?"

The question hung between them, honest and impossible to answer. Lilith could say *research on meditation and consciousness,* which was vague enough to be deflection. She could say *patterns in therapeutic intervention,* which was technically true from a certain angle. She could say *the structural impossibility of opposing someone's spiritual development,* which was accurate but would require explanations she didn't have words for.

She said nothing.

Meera sighed, the kind of sigh that carried affection and exasperation in equal measure. "Okay. I won't push. But promise me something?"

"What?"

"Eat actual meals. Sleep at least five hours a night. And text me back within the same calendar month I send the message." Meera reached across the table, squeezed Lilith's hand briefly. "I know you're brilliant and driven and doing whatever mysterious thing you're doing. But you're also my friend, and I'd quite like you to still be alive and functional when you finish."

The concern was genuine, which made it harder to deflect. Lilith managed a smile that felt almost real. "I'll try."

"Not good enough. Promise."

"I promise." The words came out easier than expected—another small performance maintained out of habit, keeping the ordinary relationships intact while the extraordinary work consumed everything underneath.

They talked for another half hour about normal things: Meera's shift, a difficult patient, hospital politics, Nadia's recent call about converting their mother's spare room into a nursery even though no pregnancy had been announced. Comfortable conversation that required nothing except presence, the kind of friendship that could survive long silences if given occasional maintenance.

But underneath the normalcy, Lilith felt the distance—the membrane between what she showed and what she knew. Meera was worried about her health, her sleep, her isolation. And she was right to be worried, in the way that people were right when they diagnosed symptoms without understanding the underlying cause.

What Meera couldn't see: the cosmic competition, the wheel of rebirth, the soul she'd been tracking for seven years through body after body, the pattern of backfires that suggested something fundamental about the structure of spiritual development that she was only now beginning to articulate.

What Meera couldn't know: that the person sitting across from her carrying a tea cup and making conversation about normal things had been on this wheel for longer than human history, had worn a thousand bodies, had felt the weight of endless embodiment settling into bone-deep understanding that finishing meant everything and failing meant continuing forever.

There was no way to explain it. No words that would make sense. No bridge between the life Meera lived—ordinary, bounded by a single lifetime, navigating normal concerns—and the life Lilith had been living since long before this incarnation began.

So she smiled, and promised to eat better, and listened to stories about the hospital with genuine interest that coexisted with the knowledge that none of it mattered compared to the work waiting in her flat.

They parted with another hug, promises to meet again soon, the comfortable maintenance of a friendship that would survive as long as Lilith kept showing up occasionally and pretending the distance wasn't widening.

Lilith walked back to her flat through streets that were familiar without being home, carrying the loneliness like a weight she'd grown so accustomed to she hardly noticed it anymore.

There was one person who might understand, eventually. But she'd have to find him first.

And after seven years of failing through distance, she was finally beginning to see what needed to change.
# Scene 4: Tracking — The Renaissance Skeptic

## Part A: The Approach

Night in Manchester. The city's ambient glow filtered through Lilith's windows, orange-gray and diffuse, the kind of light that made it impossible to see stars even when the sky was clear. She sat in her tracking corner—the same corner she'd occupied for seven years, the same position her body knew without conscious direction.

The notebooks rested within reach, their pages filled with observations that documented a pattern she was only now beginning to fully recognize. Seven years. Seven interventions. Seven backfires so consistent they suggested structure rather than accident.

She closed her eyes. Let her breathing slow and deepen, each exhale releasing a fraction of the tension her body had been carrying since the morning. The tracking required a particular quality of attention—not concentration, which was too tight, but a kind of open receptivity that let consciousness thin at the edges until past and present became permeable.

The thread waited where she'd left it: Renaissance France, 1588, a legal investigator named Jean de Langon whose capacity for doubt she'd tried to weaponize into spiritual paralysis.

She reached for him and felt the familiar shift—Manchester receding without disappearing, France emerging without quite solidifying, the dual sensation of being here and there simultaneously that seven years of practice had made manageable if not comfortable.

## Part B: Observing Jean's Journey

The tracking came into focus gradually, like eyes adjusting to darkness.

She found Jean in Bordeaux, receiving an assignment from Magistrate de Lacaze. A murder investigation—Protestant notable killed on the road, Catholics blamed, but whispers of internal betrayal. Jean listened with the careful neutrality of someone who had survived religious wars by being useful to all sides and committed to none.

Lilith observed the way Jean's fingers touched together in sequence—thumb to index, index to middle, counting through some internal weighing process. A tic of uncertainty dressed as methodological precision.

Good. She'd identified him correctly. The skeptic whose doubt ran deep enough to build identity upon.

The investigation unfolded in fragments, the tracking showing moments of significance rather than continuous narrative:

**The Witnesses**
Jean interviewing people who'd seen the killing. A Catholic merchant describing Protestant riders fleeing. A Protestant farmer reporting Catholic soldiers lurking. A servant who'd heard the victim arguing with his own faction the night before. Each account internally coherent. Mutually exclusive.

Jean's method—compare testimony, cross-reference, find inconsistencies—revealed only that the inconsistencies couldn't be resolved. His professional tools produced questions rather than answers.

Lilith watched him touch his fingers together, counting possibilities that multiplied rather than narrowed.

**The Ambush**
A wooded road. Jean attacked by masked men—faction unclear, motive ambiguous. The fight was ugly, desperate. Jean killed one attacker, wounded another, escaped bleeding from a cut on his ribs.

Lilith felt a flicker of something as she watched him bind the wound with shaking hands. Not satisfaction—Jean's suffering wasn't the point. Something else. Something that felt uncomfortably like concern for someone she was supposed to be opposing.

She pushed the feeling aside and continued tracking.

**The Printer's Widow**
Jean seeking information at a print shop run by Marguerite Viret. The widow was educated, skeptical, connected to intellectual networks. They discussed the case, but the conversation slid toward philosophy—the limits of testimony, the impossibility of certainty, what could be honestly known.

Marguerite articulated Jean's doubts more clearly than he could. "Que sais-je?" she quoted. What do I know? The skeptics' question, refined into art.

Jean felt understood. Lilith could see it in the way his shoulders loosened slightly, the way he leaned forward despite the injury in his ribs.

Dangerous. Understanding felt like safety, and safety made people vulnerable to influence.

**The Document**
An unverifiable letter suggesting Protestant conspiracy. If genuine, it resolved the investigation. If forged, it was a weapon aimed at the wrong target. Jean couldn't determine authenticity. Every verification method led back to the same problem: he couldn't know.

The paralysis crystallized. Include the document and risk perpetuating a lie. Exclude it and risk suppressing truth. Conclude nothing and fail the assignment.

This was the moment Lilith had been cultivating. Doubt refined into spiritual obstacle. Uncertainty hardened into avoidance.

**The Ball**
A nobleman's house, both factions present. Jean navigating conversations that were really interrogations, every exchange a trap. Father Sorbin with elegant questions that threatened. Captain de Castelnau's lieutenant asking about timeline with an edge that promised consequences. A Catholic lady implying knowledge of the ambush.

Jean gave neutral answers, revealed nothing, committed to nothing.

Lilith observed the social performance—everyone at the ball wearing certainty like armor even when they shared Jean's private doubts. Ambiguity as weapon. Neutrality read as secret alliance.

And then, across the hall, a brief glimpse:

## Part C: The Recognition

A noblewoman watching the proceedings with uncommon stillness. Dark hair pulled back, revealing a pronounced widow's peak. A single darker strand falling forward. Eyes that seemed to look through people rather than at them.

Isabeau de Carcassonne.

Lilith recognized the physical markers because they were hers. The same face she'd seen in Alexandria, in the Heian court, in Sor Catalina's borrowed flesh. Of course one of her past incarnations was present—she'd been on this wheel as long as he had, their threads running parallel through time.

But Isabeau stayed peripheral. Watched from across the hall. Did not approach Jean, did not engage, maintained the distance that all of Lilith's past incarnations had apparently chosen.

The observation filed itself: distance preserved, even when proximity was possible.

Interesting. Worth examining later, though not now—the tracking continued and Jean was approaching the moment that mattered.

## Part D: Jean's Breakthrough

The tracking shifted to Marguerite's shop, late at night. Jean had returned in crisis, carrying the letter, the irreconcilable testimonies, the weight of an impossible assignment.

Marguerite listened, then spoke with the precision of someone articulating what Jean had been circling without quite grasping:

"If you cannot verify, you cannot include. If you cannot resolve contradiction, you cannot conclude. Perhaps honest uncertainty means refusing to participate in their game of false certainties."

The argument was clean. Philosophically coherent. Jean almost agreed—Lilith could see it in the way he looked at the letter, then at Marguerite, then out the window at the dark streets of Bordeaux.

This was it. The nihilist position. Doubt hardened into refusal. The paralysis she'd been cultivating for—

Jean returned to his room and began writing.

But not the capitulation Lilith expected. Not the withdrawal she'd been encouraging through Marguerite's skeptical precision.

Jean wrote what he'd observed. The testimonies that couldn't be reconciled. The letter that couldn't be verified. The evidence he'd found and the evidence he'd failed to find. He wrote that he had no conclusion to offer—only a truthful account of the investigation's limits.

He submitted it to de Lacaze knowing it would satisfy no one, protect no one, be seen as betrayal by everyone who demanded useful certainty rather than honest uncertainty.

Lilith watched him walk out of the magistrate's chambers and understood: the intervention had backfired.

She'd tried to weaponize doubt into paralysis. Instead, Jean had discovered something she hadn't anticipated—that you could act *as someone who does not know.* That truthfulness didn't require certainty. That honest acknowledgment of limits was itself a form of integrity.

The doubt she'd tried to make into an obstacle had become a tool for precision.

Again. The same pattern. The same backfire. The seventh in seven years, each one teaching him something she'd meant to prevent.

## Part E: The Death

The tracking followed Jean to the road out of Bordeaux. He was leaving—the only rational choice after submitting a report that would anger both factions.

He didn't make it far.

The attack came quickly. Captain de Castelnau's men, or Father Sorbin's, or both working together—the factions united only in their need to punish the man who'd refused to give them useful certainty.

The fight was brief. Jean's shoulder—the old wound from the earlier ambush—betrayed him. He went down hard, blood spreading across the dirt road.

Lilith watched from Manchester, her consciousness tethered to Renaissance France through the tracking thread, and felt something unexpected lance through her chest.

Pain.

Not Jean's pain, though she could sense that too through the tracking's intimacy. Her pain. Sharp and physical and completely inexplicable.

She gasped, hand pressing against her sternum as if that would stop the sensation. Her Manchester body reacting to witnessing a death four hundred years past, across an ocean, in a life that wasn't hers.

The Maitreya whisper—the connection she kept dismissing—surfaced and she pushed it down. Opposition. Competition. One at a time.

But the pain remained as Jean's final thoughts burned forward:

*I told the truth about what I didn't know. That was mine to give.*

And then, the question that would seed his next incarnation:

*If I can die for honest uncertainty, what can I die for with conviction? What deserves that certainty I refused to fake?*

The hunger for an answer pulled him forward through death into whatever came next. The Taiping rebel. Someone who would find a cause worth dying for with absolute commitment.

Lilith surfaced partially from the tracking, her hand still pressed against her chest where the pain was fading but not gone. In Manchester, her breath came shallow and quick. In France, Jean's body lay still on the road, blood soaking into earth that would forget him by spring.

She'd watched him die seven times now, counting Ka. Witnessed suffering, growth, failure, transcendence across incarnations. Each death should have felt like progress—one step closer to understanding how to stop him.

Instead, this one felt like loss.

She didn't examine the feeling. Couldn't afford to.

## Part F: Withdrawal

Lilith released the tracking thread and returned fully to Manchester. Her flat materialized around her—familiar walls, city light through windows, the ordinary present moment that felt thin and strange after hours in 1588.

Her hands trembled slightly as she reached for her notebook. The headache that followed deep tracking sessions had already begun, a dull pressure building behind her eyes.

She glanced at the clock. Past midnight. Five hours had passed, though it felt like minutes. The body's reckoning was different from consciousness's—time compressed or expanded depending on which end of perception you stood at.

Seven years. Seven interventions. Seven backfires.

She wrote in her notebook with mechanical precision:

*Jean de Langon. Renaissance France, 1588. Legal investigator, religious wars.*

*Intervention: Skeptical doubt encouraged through Marguerite Viret. Attempted to cultivate paralysis through uncertainty.*

*Outcome: Discovered truthfulness without certainty. Submitted honest report acknowledging limits. Died for integrity rather than false knowledge.*

*Backfire: The doubt became a tool for precision, not an obstacle. He learned to act under uncertainty—exactly what he needed for next development.*

She paused, pen hovering over the page. Then added:

*Isabeau de Carcassonne present at ball (1588). One of my past incarnations. Peripheral, watchful. Distance maintained. Pattern consistent: parallel lives, no direct engagement.*

The observation was noted and filed without drama. Of course her past life had been there—she'd been incarnating as long as he had, her face persistent across lifetimes while his changed. The Attendant in Heian Japan. Sor Catalina in Spain. Isabeau in France. Her thread and his, running close through time but never quite touching.

Until now. Until she changed the strategy.

She set down the pen and sat in the quiet flat, feeling the weight of seven years settle into something close to understanding.

The backfires weren't random. Every intervention she'd attempted—every obstacle, every manipulation, every carefully cultivated crisis—had accelerated him rather than impeded him. The pattern was structural, not tactical.

Distance was the problem. Working through intermediaries, through circumstances, through her own past incarnations—all of it maintained separation. And separation meant she was always reacting, always one step removed, always failing to intervene at the critical moment because she wasn't there.

The pain in her chest had faded to a dull ache, present but manageable. She didn't know why watching him die had hurt. Didn't want to examine it closely enough to find out.

What mattered was the pattern. What mattered was recognizing that seven years of one approach had yielded nothing except evidence that the approach itself was flawed.

She needed proximity. Not observation from afar. Not influence through others. Direct contact. Present-day interaction. A relationship where she could intervene at the exact moment it mattered rather than watching from centuries away while her interventions backfired in real time.

Lilith closed her notebook and stood, feeling the stiffness in her legs from sitting motionless for hours. The tracking took a physical toll that had been accumulating over seven years—headaches, time loss, the particular exhaustion that came from consciousness stretched across temporal distances it wasn't designed to traverse.

But she'd learned something tonight that made the cost worth paying.

She'd learned what needed to change.

Tomorrow she would begin planning the shift. From past to present. From distance to proximity. From observation to direct engagement.

Tonight, she would sleep—or try to, though the tracking sessions often left her too wired for rest, consciousness still humming at the wrong frequency for ordinary unconsciousness.

She walked to her bedroom, lay down fully clothed, and stared at the ceiling while Manchester's ambient sound filtered through walls that felt too thin to separate past from present, her life from his, the competition from whatever else it might be if she looked at it from a different angle.

The pain in her chest had faded completely now.

She told herself that was good.

She almost believed it.
# Scene 5: Processing the Pattern

Sleep didn't come. Lilith lay in bed watching the ceiling's shadows shift as car headlights passed outside, consciousness still humming at the wrong frequency for rest. The tracking left her like this sometimes—body exhausted, mind wired, the boundary between past and present too thin for ordinary unconsciousness.

At two AM she gave up, returned to her tracking corner, and opened her notebooks.

Seven years of documentation. Seven interventions recorded with clinical precision. She'd been treating this like research, accumulating data, looking for patterns. But she'd been looking at the wrong pattern—trying to understand why each individual intervention failed rather than what the failures collectively revealed.

She turned to a fresh page and began writing.

**The Seven Backfires**

*Chapter 5 — Chandra (Mauryan India, 268 BCE):*
Intervention: Influenced Devaka's betrayal. Objective: Harden Chandra against trust, prevent development of generosity.
Outcome: Betrayal taught him that true generosity cannot depend on reciprocity. The obstacle became the lesson. He learned to give without expectation of return.
Backfire mechanism: Creating suffering around trust sharpened his understanding of what real trust requires.

*Chapter 7 — Philon (Athens, 430 BCE):*
Intervention: Dream influence sent to Alexios. Objective: Create xenophobic panic, conflate Philon's altruism with self-destruction.
Outcome: Persecution clarified his commitment rather than corrupting it. Martyrdom became vehicle for insight. He learned selflessness through its cost, not despite it.
Backfire mechanism: Opposition revealed what mattered. Dying for principle taught the difference between performance and reality.

*Chapter 9 — Verinus (Rome, c. 140 CE):*
Intervention: Circumstance manipulation around investigation. Objective: Trap him in moral paralysis through impossible choices.
Outcome: He learned to act with compassion despite complexity. Exile became space for integration. The moral dilemmas taught discernment, not paralysis.
Backfire mechanism: Complexity forced him to develop better tools for navigation rather than giving up.

*Chapter 11 — Macarius (Egyptian desert, c. 360 CE):*
Intervention: Orchestrated excessive praise through Theophanes. Objective: Build walls of recognition he couldn't see through, trap him in spiritual pride.
Outcome: Formalization became mirror. He saw himself reaching for applause in a cell designed for silence, tasted his own hunger for honor, found the shape of his grasping and released it.
Backfire mechanism: Too much of what he wanted revealed the wanting itself. The mirror showed rather than concealed.

*Chapter 13 — Kaoru (Heian Japan, c. 1000 CE):*
Intervention: Pushed my own past incarnation (the Attendant). Objective: Freeze time, remove decay, make attachment to beauty absolute.
Outcome: Static perfection proved monstrous. Absence of impermanence taught him mono no aware—beauty requires transience. He learned equanimity and patience through horror of stasis.
Backfire mechanism: Giving him exactly what he wanted revealed why he shouldn't want it. The perfect trap became the perfect teacher.

*Chapter 15 — Diego (Spanish Inquisition, 1491):*
Intervention: Appeared as Sor Catalina. Objective: Cultivate hatred so intense it becomes permanent fetter through father's betrayal and persecution.
Outcome: Suffering became crucible for releasing ill-will. He died forgiving. The hatred I tried to crystallize dissolved in fire.
Backfire mechanism: The deepest suffering catalyzed the deepest release. Maximum pressure created breakthrough, not binding.

*Chapter 17 — Jean (Renaissance France, 1588):*
Intervention: Skeptical doubt through Marguerite Viret. Objective: Weaponize uncertainty into paralysis, make doubt an obstacle to action.
Outcome: He discovered truthfulness without certainty. Learned to act as someone who does not know. Submitted honest report acknowledging limits. Died with integrity rather than false knowledge.
Backfire mechanism: The doubt became a tool for precision rather than an excuse for paralysis. I gave him the question; he found the answer I hadn't anticipated.

---

Lilith set down her pen and looked at what she'd written. Seven interventions. Seven outcomes. The pattern was undeniable when laid out like this—each attempt to create an obstacle had instead created exactly the condition necessary for the next development.

She wasn't slowing his progress. She was **training** him.

The word settled into her chest with the weight of revelation. Not teaching—that would imply intention. Training. The way resistance strengthened muscle, the way opposition sharpened thinking, the way every obstacle she placed in his path became the whetstone that honed him toward the very thing she was trying to prevent.

The kinship whisper from earlier chapters surfaced—the recognition she kept filing away without examination. Watching Macarius perform asceticism while hungry for recognition, she'd thought: *What does that remind me of?* The question had gone unanswered, deliberately not completed.

Now, sitting with seven backfires documented, the parallel was harder to ignore.

His attachment to spiritual achievement. Her attachment to finishing first.
His performance of progress. Her performance of opposition.
His grasping disguised as pursuit. Her grasping disguised as competition.

She wrote in the margin: *"Together doesn't hold"* — the insight from Chapter 7 that had never been fully examined. His attempts to isolate, to find truth alone, had always failed because separation wasn't the path. Connection mattered. Relationship mattered. The friction between souls mattered in ways she'd been treating as obstacle rather than... what? Necessity? Structure? The actual mechanism of development?

She stopped that line of thinking before it went somewhere she wasn't ready to go.

What mattered was the tactical assessment: seven years of working from distance had failed. Every intervention through intermediaries, through circumstances, through her own past incarnations—all of it maintained separation. And separation meant she was always reacting after the fact, always one step removed, always failing to intervene at the critical moment because she wasn't there when it mattered.

Distance was the problem.

The solution appeared with the clarity of inevitability: proximity. Direct contact. Present-day relationship.

She'd been tracking his past lives for seven years while he lived in her time, her city, probably within a few miles of where she sat right now. The absurdity of it struck her—chasing him through history while he walked streets she could drive to in twenty minutes.

Find him in the present. Engineer a meeting. Become part of his life directly.

The strategy felt both obvious and terrifying, though she didn't examine the terror closely enough to understand what it stemmed from. Fear of failure? Or fear of something else—the intimacy that proximity would require, the mask she'd have to wear or not wear, the relationship that would develop if she stopped maintaining distance?

She wrote: *New approach: Stop working in past. Find him in present timeline. Direct contact necessary.*

Then, more slowly: *First step: Locate next incarnation. Trace forward to present.*

The thread had seeded itself in Jean's final question—*what deserves certain commitment?* The answer would manifest in someone who found a cause worth dying for. Historical period: China, mid-1800s. The Taiping Rebellion—religious fervor channeled into armed uprising, conviction tested by chaos.

She would need to track that incarnation, learn its shape, follow the thread forward through whatever came after until it reached her time. The work would take weeks, maybe months. But it would give her the map she needed—the path from Renaissance France to modern Manchester, the shape of his development across the centuries she'd been observing from the wrong end.

Lilith closed her notebook and sat in the quiet flat, feeling something that might have been resolve if examined closely but felt more like the simple recognition of what needed to happen next.

Seven years of one approach. Seven failures. The pattern was clear.

Time to try something completely different.

She glanced at the clock. Three-fifteen AM. In four hours she'd need to be at the clinic, presenting the professional mask to patients who expected competence and got it even though the person providing it was increasingly elsewhere.

But tomorrow evening, she would begin the forward trace. From Jean to the Taiping rebel to whatever came after. Following the thread until it reached the present, until she could attach a name and a face and a location to the soul she'd been tracking through seven years and countless lifetimes.

And then—the meeting she'd been avoiding through distance.
And then—the proximity that might succeed where separation had failed.
And then—whatever came next, which she couldn't predict because prediction assumed the patterns would continue and she was betting everything on changing them.

Lilith stood, stretched the stiffness from her back, and returned to bed. This time, sleep came more easily—consciousness finally willing to let go of the tracking session now that the processing was complete and the decision made.

She dreamed of ballrooms and burning stakes and a face that changed with each incarnation while hers stayed stubbornly, persistently the same.

When she woke four hours later, the decision remained: find him in the present.

No more distance.

The thought should have felt like victory—a strategic pivot, a new approach after years of failure.

Instead it felt like standing at an edge she couldn't quite see the bottom of, preparing to step forward anyway because standing still had proved impossible and stepping back had never been an option.

She got up, made coffee, prepared for another day of clinical work that would end with her returning to the tracking corner to begin the search that would change everything.

The notebooks waited.
The thread waited.
And somewhere in Manchester, the person she'd been chasing through history went about his ordinary life, unknowing and unaware that the distance between them was about to collapse.
# Scene 6: CODA — The Search Begins

The next evening, Lilith returned to her tracking corner with a different intention. Not observation—she'd done enough of that. Not intervention—seven years had taught her the futility of working through the past.

This was reconnaissance. A forward search to trace the thread from Renaissance France to wherever it landed in her time.

She'd spent the day at the clinic going through familiar motions—sessions with patients, documentation, a brief conversation with Harrow about scheduling next month's supervision hours. The ordinary architecture of professional life, maintained on autopilot while the real work waited at home.

Now, with Manchester settling into evening darkness outside her windows, she closed her eyes and reached for the tracking state.

The thread she'd followed backward for seven years could also be followed forward—though the technique was different. Scanning rather than deep immersion. Touching points along the timeline rather than inhabiting them fully. Looking for where Jean's final question would manifest into flesh.

*If I can die for honest uncertainty, what can I die for with conviction?*

The answer would take shape somewhere. Someone seeking a cause that deserved absolute commitment. Someone who would learn what Jean had died needing to understand.

Lilith let her consciousness thin, scanning forward from 1588. Decades passed in flickers. The thread moved through death and dissolution and the space between incarnations where consciousness reorganized itself for the next attempt.

Then—there. China. The 1850s, though the exact year was harder to pinpoint from this distance. The thread stirring, gathering coherence, taking shape around historical chaos.

She focused her attention and caught glimpses:

A young man. Late teens or early twenties. The details were fragmentary, imprecise—the forward scan didn't offer the same clarity as backward tracking, showed tendency and direction rather than specific narrative.

But she could sense the shape of what was forming:

**Conviction** born from Jean's doubt resolution. The capacity to commit fully, learned through watching uncertainty become integrity.

**Willingness to sacrifice** for something larger. The question Jean had died asking, now finding its answer in someone prepared to give everything for a cause that mattered.

**The Taiping Rebellion** as crucible. Religious fervor channeled into armed uprising. Chaos and violence and the terrible clarity that came from fighting for what you believed deserved your life.

The glimpses were enough. This was the next incarnation—Chapter 18 in the sequence she'd been following. The bridge between Renaissance skepticism and whatever came after.

Lilith withdrew partially from the scan, making notes in her tracking journal:

*Next incarnation: China, c. 1850-1864. Taiping Rebellion era. Male, late teens-early twenties. Central question: what deserves certain commitment? Learning through commitment's cost.*

She would need to return to this, track it more completely, understand how the lesson developed and where it led. But not tonight. Tonight was about confirming the path existed—that she could trace forward from Jean through the Taiping rebel to whatever came next.

And next would be... what? She scanned further forward, trying to catch the thread as it moved beyond the mid-1800s.

Fragments:

Another death. The Taiping incarnation dying for the cause he'd found—but whether that death taught what it needed to or became another backfire, she couldn't tell from this distance.

Then: reformation. Late 1800s? Early 1900s? The timeline blurred. Somewhere in that range, another life beginning. Western context this time—she could sense it in the thread's texture, though the specifics remained unclear.

And after that...

She pushed further, trying to catch the thread as it approached her era. The scan became harder to maintain—looking too far forward strained the tracking in ways that backward observation didn't. Like trying to see through fog that thickened with every step.

But there, at the edge of perception—

A spark. Modern era. Recent. Possibly alive right now, in her time, in her world.

Lilith's breath caught. Her Manchester body went very still, awareness split between the tracking trance and the physical present.

He was here. Somewhere. The soul she'd been tracking through seven years and countless lifetimes had landed in her era, close enough to touch if she could just narrow the search from "modern world" to specific location, specific person, specific life that could be found and approached and engaged with directly.

The technical problem clarified: she needed to trace the intermediate incarnations. The Taiping rebel would lead to the next, and that to the next, until the thread landed precisely in the present rather than vaguely in "her time."

Weeks of work. Maybe months. Careful tracking, patient observation, building the map from Renaissance France to modern Manchester step by life by death by rebirth.

But it was possible. The thread existed. He existed. Somewhere close—close enough that the tracking could sense him even if it couldn't yet pinpoint him.

Lilith released the scan entirely and returned to her flat, to her body, to the ordinary present moment that suddenly felt charged with different possibilities.

Dawn was approaching—she'd been tracking through the night again, hours passing unnoticed while consciousness wandered through time. The window showed Manchester's sky beginning to pale, that particular gray-blue that came before sunrise when the city was still quiet but no longer quite dark.

She stood, feeling the stiffness in her joints from sitting motionless. Stretched. Made tea while the kettle's sound filled the kitchen with its ordinary promise that heat could be transferred, that water could change states, that the world followed reliable patterns even when consciousness didn't.

The tea steamed in her hands as she returned to the tracking corner and looked at her notebooks. Seven years of observation. Seven interventions. Seven backfires. And now—a completely different approach.

Find him in the present.

The decision had solidified overnight, moving from strategic pivot to settled fact. She would trace the thread forward, life by life, until it landed in a name and a face and a location she could actually reach. Then she would engineer a meeting. Become part of his life. Position herself close enough to intervene not from centuries away but from across a room, a table, a conversation where she could see his face and he could see hers for the first time in this timeline.

The thought carried something she didn't quite want to examine—not excitement, which would be too simple, but a kind of anticipation that included uncertainty about whether she was preparing for battle or something else entirely.

She drank her tea as dawn light strengthened outside, washing the city in gradations of gray and gold. Somewhere out there, in one of those buildings or streets or ordinary spaces where people lived their unremarkable lives, he was waking up. Going to work. Moving through a day that would seem perfectly normal because he didn't know yet that someone had been tracking him through history and was finally, after seven years of distance, preparing to close the gap.

Chapter 1 was three years away—that's when they'd be lovers, when she'd confess, when the final intervention would begin. But before she could get there, she needed to find him. Learn his name. Discover where he worked, where he lived, what ordinary life he'd built in the brief decades between birth and the moment she'd appear in it.

The work would take time. But time was something she had, even if patience was something she'd been running short on.

Lilith finished her tea, rinsed the cup, and prepared for another day at the clinic. The tracking would continue tomorrow night. And the night after. And for however many nights it took to follow the thread from Taiping China through whatever came next until it landed precisely where she needed it.

In the doorway, she paused and looked back at her tracking corner. The notebooks stacked carefully. The space that had consumed seven years while yielding nothing except the knowledge that what she'd been doing wouldn't work.

Seven years of one approach ending.

Something new beginning.

She left for work as the city woke around her, and carried the decision with her like a weight that might be burden or might be ballast—she couldn't tell yet which, and wouldn't know until she'd followed the thread to its conclusion and discovered what proximity taught that distance had concealed.

The search had begun.

The distance was closing.

And somewhere in Manchester, unknowing and unaware, he continued the life he'd been living while she prepared to step into it.

Three years until Chapter 1.

But first—finding him.

The work continued.
