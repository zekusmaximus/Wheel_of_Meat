# Chapter 7, Scene III: Between

-----

The weeks passed in their familiar rhythm—sessions and supervision and the accumulated paperwork of clinical training, the days distinguishing themselves only by small variations in weather and caseload. May arrived with surprising warmth, the Manchester sky clearing to something almost Mediterranean, light lasting later into evenings that no longer required lamps.

Lilith's caseload stabilized. Gerald Ashworth continued his slow dismantling, the spreadsheets now relegated to a drawer he rarely opened. David Mercer had hired a night nurse, three nights a week, and reported sleeping better than he had in months. The test-anxious graduate student had passed her qualifying exams and terminated with appropriate gratitude. New intakes arrived to fill the spaces: a retired teacher grappling with purpose, a young professional numbed by repetitive work, the endless variation on themes of meaning and identity that comprised the clinical life.

She was good at this work. The recognition arrived without vanity, the simple fact of someone who had found their aptitude and developed it. She could hear the shape of a patient's distress before they fully articulated it, could find the question that opened rather than closed, could hold space for suffering without being consumed by it. Dr. Harrow had begun referring to her as "promising"—which, from Harrow, bordered on extravagance.

Between sessions, in the margins of clinical hours, other patterns continued.

Her mother's house on Saturday had smelled of roasting lamb and the particular nervous energy of a woman introducing her new partner to her children. Jeff Yates was taller than Lilith expected—six-two, broad-shouldered, with the weathered hands of someone who worked outdoors. He had stood in the kitchen doorway with a bottle of wine he had clearly agonized over, his uncertainty endearing rather than off-putting.

"I hope this is all right," he'd said, offering the bottle. "The shop said it pairs well with lamb, but I'm never sure they know what they're talking about."

"It's perfect," Lilith had told him, and meant it.

The dinner had proceeded in the careful choreography of new configurations: her mother overly bright, compensating for tension that existed mostly in her imagination; Jeff measuring his words, trying to show interest without intruding; Lilith navigating between them with the neutral attentiveness that came naturally to her now. He worked in landscape architecture, she learned. Had been married before, divorced amicably, no children. Met her mother at a garden show, of all places, where she had been admiring a display he had designed.

"She stood there for twenty minutes," Jeff said, a flush of memory coloring his weathered face. "I thought she was judging my plant selection. Turns out she was just trying to work up the nerve to talk to me."

"I was not," her mother protested, but her denial lacked conviction.

Lilith watched them together as the evening unfolded. The small touches—his hand finding hers across the table, her automatic lean toward him when he spoke. The way they had already developed private jokes, shared references, the compressed history of eight months becoming visible in gesture and glance. This was not the villain Nadia had described. This was a man who loved her mother and was trying, with obvious care, to be worthy of that love.

The thought of Nadia surfaced and passed. Her sister had not called again since the morning conversation, though texts had been exchanged—polite, surface-level, the careful communication of two people circling a conflict neither wanted to have. Lilith had let it rest. Some things needed time to settle before they could be properly addressed.

"I hope we haven't put you in an awkward position," Jeff said as she was leaving, the bottle of wine now half-empty between them. "I know the timing's been... I know Nadia's struggling with it."

"The timing is what it is." Lilith pulled on her jacket, finding the familiar weight of her phone in the pocket. "You can't schedule falling in love."

He blinked at that—the directness of it, perhaps, or the implicit absolution. Her mother had already disappeared into the kitchen, tactfully allowing them this exchange.

"She's protective of her sister," Lilith continued. "And she feels like her moment is being overshadowed. That's real, and it's valid. But it's not about you, specifically. It's about the timing."

"So what should I do?"

"Be kind. Be patient. Let her see who you actually are, not who she's decided you are." Lilith shouldered her bag. "And maybe hold off on the June wedding until after her engagement party in May."

Jeff's face went through several expressions in rapid succession. "Your mother suggested September."

"September is good."

The drive home had been quiet, Manchester's streets emptying as the late hour stretched toward midnight. Lilith had let her thoughts drift without anchoring them—the evening's small data points arranging themselves into patterns she did not need to analyze. Her mother was happy. Jeff was genuine. Nadia would come around, eventually, when the wound of feeling overshadowed had time to heal.

Some problems solved themselves. Others required intervention.

Her flat welcomed her with its familiar dimness, the shapes of furniture resolving out of shadow as she moved through to the kitchen. Water, then tea. The rituals of return, the small anchors that grounded consciousness back into body, back into the present moment, back into the particular configuration of space and time she currently inhabited.

The notebooks waited in their corner of the sitting room—three of them now, the original supplemented by two more as the tracking work had expanded. She could feel them there even without looking, the gravitational pull of accumulated documentation, the threads she had followed and the ones that remained to be traced.

Philon's death still needed confirmation. She had watched his intervention in Athens unfold—the xenophobic rumors she had amplified, the dream she had sent to Alexios, the cascade of isolation that had left the physician to face his final choice alone. But she had not yet returned to witness the outcome. Had not yet followed his thread through death to whatever understanding emerged on the other side.

The tea steeped in its cup, forgotten. Lilith stood at the window, looking out at the city's scattered lights, her reflection ghosting against the dark glass. The face she had worn for twenty-seven years looked back at her—dark hair, pale skin, the features she would carry until this body failed and the pattern sought new conditions.

*Later,* she told herself. *The tracking can wait.*

But even as she thought it, she was moving toward the corner. The lamp. The practiced position. The slow settling of breath that preceded the work.

Philon's thread hummed at the edge of perception, waiting to be found.
