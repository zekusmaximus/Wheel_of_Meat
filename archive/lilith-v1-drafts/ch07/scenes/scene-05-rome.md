# Chapter 7, Scene V: The Road to Rome

-----

The tea had gone cold again. Lilith noticed this with the detached amusement of someone who had repeated the same oversight countless times—the pattern of abandoning cups in pursuit of other patterns, the body's needs forgotten while consciousness ranged elsewhere.

She drank it anyway. The bitter taste grounded her, confirmed the ordinariness of the kitchen around her: the hum of appliances, the stack of clinical files she had brought home to review, the window showing Manchester's lights scattered across the predawn darkness. Three hours had passed since she settled into her tracking position. Three hours that had felt like minutes.

The recognition from Philon's death still resonated. She had not dismissed it—that would have been too reactive, too defensive. Instead she had filed it alongside her other observations: the concentrated karma, the crystallized question, the way isolation had served rather than corrupted. Data points to be considered, understood, eventually integrated into her model of how patterns developed.

But the question lingered. *Could they be on the same journey?*

She returned to her corner, not to track but to map. The technique was different—less intensive, less immersive, more like scanning a horizon than following a specific path. She had used it before when orienting herself in time, when trying to understand the larger geography of consciousness that her practices had revealed.

Her own iterations served as landmarks. The physician in Alexandria, whose memories surfaced in the smell of natron and embalming spices. The sutler following Wellington's army through Spain, whose feet still ached in wet weather from marches she had never taken. The washerwoman in Guangzhou, whose hands remembered lye and the particular exhaustion of labor that never ended. Each one a fixed point, a temporal marker, a waystation on whatever journey her own pattern was traveling.

She touched them briefly, confirming their positions in the vast architecture of time. Then she turned her attention to the space between—the regions where his thread might cross near hers.

*Alexandria.*

Her physician-self had worked there during the Ptolemaic period. A woman of learning in a city of learning, healing the wealthy and occasionally the poor, accumulating the merit that carried forward to her next configuration. Had there been another pattern near her then? Another consciousness working at its own development, crossing paths without either of them knowing?

She searched, but found nothing. The threads did not seem to have intersected in that place, that time.

*Spain.*

The sutler had followed armies across the Iberian Peninsula, selling provisions to soldiers who would mostly die before they could pay. A small life, difficult and pragmatic, but one that had taught her something about presence—about remaining with suffering rather than fleeing it. The Taiping Rebellion lay centuries in the future, but perhaps—

Nothing. The threads remained parallel, close but not touching.

*Guangzhou.*

The washerwoman had existed in the margins of empire, her labor invisible except to those who benefited from it. She had died of a fever in her forty-third year, her body worn out by decades of work, her pattern carrying forward a particular understanding of service without recognition.

And there—something. Not intersection exactly, but *proximity*. A sense that another thread had passed nearby, that the space she had occupied had been adjacent to the space he had occupied. Close enough to feel, too distant to confirm.

She noted the impression without pursuing it. The night was already old, and the tracking had left her depleted. Whatever she might discover about their potential convergence could wait for another session.

Instead, she turned her attention forward. Philon's thread had released, had dispersed, was even now seeking conditions for its next manifestation. Where would it anchor? What form would the pattern take as it continued its work?

She scanned the gap between deaths—that formless space where patterns persisted without persisting—and found the thread reforming on the other side.

The impression arrived not as image but as texture: marble and bureaucracy, the weight of written law, the obsession with certainty that Philon's dying question had seeded. A city built on order, on system, on the belief that human affairs could be understood and regulated and made to behave predictably.

*Rome.*

The name surfaced from the pattern's own self-knowing, as Ka and Chandra and Philon had surfaced before. The thread had found conditions that matched its need—a society that prized investigation, that valued evidence, that believed truth could be determined through careful examination.

Someone obsessed with certainty. An investigator. A man who would carry Philon's incomplete lesson into new territory, wrestling with questions of virtue and knowledge and the gap between what could be proven and what could be trusted.

And beneath the pattern—the faint suggestion of proximity once more. One of her iterations might have been near this one. Close enough to touch.

Her powers were growing. The realization settled into her like water finding its level. Three years ago, she had barely been able to follow Margaret's thread to a toddler in Leeds. Now she was tracing patterns across millennia, influencing choices, shaping development. Soon she might do more than observe Rome. Soon she might be able to appear there, manifest, interact directly with whatever form his pattern was taking.

The thought carried no alarm. She was not someone who alarmed easily.

But it carried something else—a question she was not yet ready to ask. If she could appear to him directly, what would she do? Continue her interventions, certainly. Continue the pressure that had accelerated his development even as she tried to derail it. But the recognition from tonight—the sense of kinship, of parallel journeys—what would that mean when she stood before him in whatever face she wore in that era?

The thought dissolved before she could follow it. The tracking session had depleted her reserves, and the body she inhabited was making its needs known: the headache building behind her eyes, the fine tremor in her hands, the hollowness that indicated too many hours without food.

She set down the cold tea and crossed to the window. Dawn was approaching, the eastern sky beginning its slow transition from black to gray. Manchester lay below, beginning to stir—buses rumbling, lights appearing in windows, the city reassembling itself for another day.

She had a full schedule: three patients, supervision with Harrow, the accumulated documentation that clinical work required. Her ordinary life, continuing its ordinary patterns, demanding its ordinary attention.

And beneath it—always beneath it—the other work continued.

*Rome,* she thought. *A city of law and certainty. A man who needs to know.*

The thread hummed at the edge of perception, ready to be followed. The recognition from Philon's death remained, untroubling but unfaded—a question she had filed but not answered, a stone she kept touching in her pocket.

*Could we be on the same journey?*

The question was interesting. She would give it time.

For now, there was only the gray light of morning, the city waking below her, the body that required sleep and food and the ordinary maintenance of consciousness housed in flesh. She would attend to these things. She would be present in her patients' sessions. She would navigate her mother's wedding preparations with the equanimity that came naturally to her.

And later—always later—she would return to the tracking corner. Follow the thread toward Rome. See what awaited in the next configuration of a pattern she had been watching for three years.

The dawn light strengthened. Lilith turned from the window and moved toward her bedroom, her footsteps quiet on the flat's wooden floor. The notebooks waited in their corner, patient and accumulating. The threads hummed at the edge of perception, parallel and close.

She did not know—could not yet know—that they would only grow closer. That the proximity she had sensed would become something more. That the question she had filed would eventually demand an answer.

For now, she knew only that she was tired, that the day would soon begin, and that somewhere in the architecture of time, a pattern continued its work toward completion.

As did her own.
