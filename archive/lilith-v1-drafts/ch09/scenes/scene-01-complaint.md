# Chapter 9, Scene I: The Complaint Arrives

-----

The clinical office caught the morning light in its usual way—gray and indirect, filtered through windows that faced the wrong direction for warmth. Lilith sat at her desk between sessions, reviewing notes from the previous hour. The patient had been making progress, or something that looked like progress from the outside. Whether it would hold under pressure remained to be seen.

She wrote a final observation in the margins, set down her pen, and allowed herself a moment of stillness. Her thoughts drifted toward the tracking materials waiting in her flat. Three nights ago, she had followed Verinus's thread to its end—the olive grove, the stylus, the contradictory testimonies he had finally stopped trying to resolve. The insight he had reached: genuine. The subtle pride beneath it: also genuine. She was still processing what that meant.

A knock at the door.

"Dr. Azami? Dr. Whitmore would like to see you when you have a moment."

Something in the phrasing—*when you have a moment*—suggested this was not about scheduling. Lilith filed the session notes, gathered her thoughts, and walked through corridors that smelled of institutional carpet and antiseptic air.

Dr. Whitmore's office was two floors up. Lilith knocked and entered at the invitation, noting that something about the woman's posture had shifted from professional neutrality toward something more careful.

"Please, sit." Whitmore gestured to the chair across from her desk. Mid-fifties, gray hair pulled back with practical severity, reading glasses perched on her nose. A clinician who had spent decades learning to mask her reactions, now wearing that mask with particular deliberation. "I'm afraid we have a somewhat delicate matter to discuss."

Lilith sat. Her hands rested on her knees, still and patient.

"A complaint has been filed." Whitmore opened a folder on her desk—thin, newly created, its contents visible in the shadow of her reading glasses. "One of your former patients. A Mr. Luther Crane."

The name surfaced from Lilith's memory like a body rising from water. Luther Crane. Late fifties, stay-at-home father after his wife's career overtook his own, struggling with what he called "irrelevance" and what the clinical picture suggested was a more complex tangle of displaced ambition and unprocessed grief. She had seen him for eight sessions before he terminated treatment without explanation.

"I remember him," Lilith said.

"He's claiming that you provided what he calls 'dangerous advice.'" Whitmore's voice was level, the words themselves carrying no accusation—but the fact of their speaking was its own kind of weight. "Specifically, he alleges that you recommended a course of action that caused significant harm to his family relationships."

Lilith reviewed the sessions in her mind. Luther had been resistant from the first—convinced that he already understood his situation, that he required validation rather than insight, that the young woman across from him could not possibly comprehend the particular shape of his disappointment. She had worked to meet him where he was, had offered frameworks that might help him see his patterns without threatening his defenses. She had not, to her recollection, recommended anything more dramatic than honest communication with his wife about his needs.

"What specifically is he claiming I recommended?"

Whitmore consulted the file. "According to his statement, you advised him to confront his wife about what he describes as 'her pattern of emotional neglect,' and that this confrontation—which he says he undertook on your explicit recommendation—resulted in severe damage to their marriage."

The gap between what Lilith remembered and what Luther was claiming opened like a chasm. She had suggested he consider sharing his experience with his wife, yes—but framed carefully, exploratively, as one option among several. She had not recommended confrontation. She had not used the phrase "emotional neglect." She had not given him explicit instructions to do anything.

He had, she realized, twisted her words into something that absolved him of responsibility. Whatever conversation he'd had with his wife—and whatever damage had resulted—was now her fault, in his reconstruction. The failure was not his inability to hear what she had actually said, or his refusal to do the work of genuine self-examination. The failure was hers.

"I see," Lilith said.

"The complaint will require a formal review." Whitmore closed the folder. "Standard procedure. Your session notes will be examined, and a panel will assess whether your clinical judgment met the expected standard of care."

"Who will be on the panel?"

"Myself, of course. Dr. Patel from ethics. And—" Whitmore paused, just briefly enough to signal that this next piece of information carried particular weight. "Dr. Harrow has been assigned as the third reviewer."

Lilith processed this. Harrow—who had been supervising her clinical work with his particular combination of skepticism and professional rigor. Harrow—whom she had filed, after months of interaction, as someone who would be difficult if given the opportunity.

She recalibrated.

He would be difficult—but difficulty was not the same as unfairness. She had perhaps categorized him too simply. The review would reveal whether that simplification had been accurate or not.

"I understand," Lilith said. "When will the review take place?"

"Sometime in the next two weeks. You'll be notified of the specific date." Whitmore studied her over the rim of her glasses, looking for something—distress, perhaps, or defensiveness, or the kind of rattled behavior that might suggest the complaint had landed on genuine fault. She found none of these things.

"Is there anything else I should know?"

"The complaint is internal at this stage. Mr. Crane has not escalated to the regulatory board. That's—" Whitmore allowed herself a small, professional sigh. "That's somewhat better than the alternative."

Lilith nodded. She rose from the chair, her movements unhurried, her posture unchanged. "Thank you for informing me."

She walked back through the corridors, past the antiseptic air and the fluorescent lights humming their eternal frequency. Her next patient would arrive in twenty minutes. The ordinary architecture of the day continued to make its demands.

Luther Crane's complaint was unfair. His accusations were distortions. And yet the process would unfold regardless: documents examined, judgments rendered, her clinical reasoning subjected to the scrutiny of people who had not been present for the sessions in question.

She felt no anger at this. No panic. Only a distant curiosity, as if observing a weather system from the safety of some inner remove.

*Interesting,* she thought. *This will require attention.*

The tracking would have to wait. The thread toward Rome hummed at the edge of perception, patient as always. It was not going anywhere. Neither was she.

Lilith returned to her office, sat in her chair, and prepared to meet her next patient with the same unhurried attention she brought to everything. The world was full of people who could not see themselves clearly. Luther Crane was one of them. She was not—or so she believed—and that was the difference.
