Cold. The impression arrived first, before sight or sound: cold that sank through flesh to bone, cold that stiffened fingers and slowed blood and turned breath to crystals in the air. Lilith did not become the dying one—she remained herself, a witness separated by time and the thin membrane of consciousness—but the sensations leaked through anyway, phantom ice forming in her chest.

The cave was a darker darkness within the dark. Rough walls wept moisture that would freeze before morning. Something crouched there, something that had been human in the way she was human but whose mind worked in shapes she could barely recognize.

*Ka.*

The name surfaced from nowhere, from the thread itself, from whatever connection she had made with this ancient pattern. Ka. A hunter, she understood. A keeper of meat.

The meat was everywhere. She could see it in the way Ka's consciousness shaped the space: the pile of flesh against the cave wall, stolen from the tribe below, hoarded against the cold that was killing him. His fingers—*her* fingers, for one disorienting moment—clutched at frozen deer haunch, nails blackened with frostbite, and the word *mine* pulsed through the cave like a heartbeat.

*Mine. Mine. Mine.*

The tribe's fire smoked in the distance, visible through the cave mouth as a faint orange glow. Lilith saw them as Ka saw them: not individuals but a single organism, a rival claim on the meat he had taken, the resources he had kept. They shared warmth down there. They passed food hand to hand. They slept in piles like wolves, breath mixing in the dark.

Ka had rejected this. Ka had chosen the cave and the cold and the certainty that his meat belonged to him.

*But mine is frozen now,* came the thought, and Lilith could not tell if it was Ka's or her own. *Frozen like my fingers. Frozen like my blood.*

The death came slowly, as deaths by cold always did. First the shaking stopped—the body's last-ditch effort to generate warmth surrendering to something inevitable. Then the strange warmth that preceded the final cold, the body's systems shutting down in sequence, the mind contracting to a single point of awareness.

And in that contraction, something opened.

Lilith watched Ka understand. Watched the hoarded meat become meaningless as the body that would consume it failed. Watched the tribe's distant warmth become suddenly, terribly significant—not as rival but as alternative, as the thing he had refused, as the giving he had been unable to learn.

*Need to know,* Ka's dying mind insisted. *Need to understand giving. Need to—*

The thread pulsed with the force of it. Not thought exactly, not language, but hunger—a hunger for understanding that burned through the cold, through the failing flesh, through the boundary between this life and whatever came next. Ka died grasping, but the grasping had transformed. Not meat anymore. Something else.

The vision released her. Lilith found herself gasping in her Manchester flat, her hands pressed flat against the floor as if to confirm its solidity. Her head throbbed. Nausea coiled in her stomach, residue of the cold that had never touched her actual body.

She stood on shaking legs and crossed to the window. Rain streaked the glass, blurring the streetlights below. Three in the morning. Five hours she had been gone.

The thread remained, faint but findable, humming at the edge of her perception. Ka's pattern had not ended in that cave. The hunger for understanding had carried forward, seeking new conditions, new flesh, new opportunity to learn what he had failed to learn in dying.

*Such intensity,* she thought. *Such need.*

She recognized it. The recognition was uncomfortable, a mirror she had not asked to look into. Her own hunger for completion. Her own desperate reaching toward something just beyond her grasp.

But that was for later. For now, there was only the question that had driven her here: could she follow the thread forward? Could she track Ka's pattern through death to rebirth, the way she had tracked Margaret to the toddler in Leeds?

She returned to the floor, to the lamp's dim circle, to the practice she had never named. The interpretive work would get more difficult. She did not care.
