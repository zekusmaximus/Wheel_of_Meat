The gap was the hardest part.

Lilith had learned this from her own iterations: the space between death and rebirth resisted observation. It was not a place exactly, not a time, but something else—a state that language could only approximate. The pattern existed there without existing, persisted without persisting, carried forward by forces she could describe but not explain.

*Like trying to see through water,* she had written once, in a notebook from her second year of postgraduate training. The phrase remained accurate.

She followed Ka's thread into the gap and lost it immediately. The cold sensation vanished; the sense of ancient depth collapsed into formlessness. For a long, disorienting moment, she drifted in something that was neither dark nor light, neither warm nor cold, neither here nor elsewhere. The pattern she had tracked became indistinguishable from the void that held it.

Then—gradually, like dawn—coherence returned.

Not cold now. Warm. The warmth of enclosure, of flesh pressed against flesh, of a rhythm that was not her own heartbeat but surrounded her own heartbeat, contained it, gave it context. A womb. The pattern had found new conditions.

She could not see—the forming body had no eyes to see with—but she could sense: the dense, wet darkness of gestation, the slow construction of limbs and organs, the hunger for life that had survived the crossing. The same pattern. The same thread. New flesh building around it like coral forming on a reef.

*India.*

The knowing arrived the way such knowings always did, from nowhere and everywhere at once. The pattern had anchored in a place that would not be called India for millennia yet, in a time when empires rose and fell like breaths. She could sense the shape of the society forming around the forming body: structured, hierarchical, concerned with duty and commerce and the proper ordering of human affairs.

A woman's voice reached her through the membrane of perception—singing, she thought, though the words meant nothing. The mother. The new container. The conditions that had attracted Ka's desperate hunger.

*Chandra.*

The name surfaced as Ka had surfaced, from the thread itself, from the pattern's own self-knowing. The parents had not yet spoken it; the child had not yet been born. But the shape of the name was there, waiting to be filled like a vessel waiting for water.

She tracked further forward, straining against the blur that always surrounded new incarnations. The birth. The first breath—always the same shock, life into life, the pattern settling into flesh with a finality that closed the gap behind it. The boy growing, learning language, learning commerce, learning the ordered world of the Mauryan court.

He would be an administrator, she saw. A keeper of records. The merchant's son who rose to manage the Empire's accounts, who measured suffering in numbers and responses in resource allocation. Still learning what Ka had died needing to learn. Still working at the lesson of giving.

The vision thinned. Lilith could hold it no longer—the strain of sustained tracking pulled at something behind her eyes, threatened to collapse the perception entirely. She withdrew carefully, following her own thread back to the body waiting in Manchester, the rain-streaked window and the cold tea and the lamp's faithful glow.

Her hands were shaking. She stood, walked to the kitchen, drank water directly from the tap. The effort had settled into a dull, persistent pressure at her temples, inherent price of the practice.

She had done it. The technique worked on others the way it worked on herself—follow the thread, trace the pattern, track the consciousness through death to rebirth. Ka to Chandra, separated by hundreds of thousands of years but connected by something that survived the passage.

*A fellow traveler.*

The phrase arrived and settled. That was what she had found. Not enemy, not rival, not threat. Someone else doing the work she was doing, albeit from much further back, with much further to go. Someone else accumulating, refining, building toward whatever waited at the end of the process she could sense but not yet see.

Dawn light was beginning to gray the window. Lilith had been awake for twenty-two hours. Her body insisted on sleep, on food, on the ordinary maintenance that consciousness required when housed in flesh.

She returned to her notebook instead.
