The notebook lay open on the kitchen table, its pages dense with fifteen years of her own cartography. Lilith held her pen above a fresh page, watching the ink gather at the tip without falling.

*Chandra.*

She wrote the single word in the margin, precise and small. Underlined it once. The ink shone wet for a moment before the paper drank it in.

The entry felt incomplete. There was more to document: Ka's death and its desperate hunger, the gap and its formlessness, the womb-warmth of rebirth and the slow construction of new flesh. The Mauryan Empire and its administrators. The merchant's son learning commerce, learning duty, learning everything except what he most needed to learn.

But the documentation could wait. Tonight she had proven something larger than any single observation: the threads extended beyond herself. The patterns were trackable. The phenomenon was not anomaly but architecture, a structure of consciousness that operated whether or not she understood its mechanics.

Her tea had reached room temperature, neither cold nor warm. She drank it anyway, tasting nothing, her attention still turned toward the dark place where the threads hummed at the edge of perception.

*If I tracked this pattern forward through time,* she thought, *would I find where it is now? In the present day?*

The question contained its own danger. She could feel it the way she felt a patient's resistance, the subtle tension that preceded some difficult disclosure. Following Ka to Chandra had been an exercise, a proof of concept. Following Chandra forward—through however many subsequent iterations, however many deaths and rebirths, to whatever configuration the pattern currently occupied—that was something else.

That was pursuit.

She closed the notebook. Set down the pen. Outside, Manchester was stirring toward morning: bus engines rumbling on Oxford Road, the first students crossing to early lectures, the ordinary machinery of a world that did not know it contained such things as she had seen tonight.

*Tomorrow,* she thought. *Clinical rounds, supervision with Harrow, the case presentation I've been putting off. Real work. Explicable work.*

The schedule reassured her. She had a life here, carefully constructed, professionally successful. A reputation for brilliance tempered by appropriate humility. Patients who trusted her. Colleagues who respected her. A future mapped in publications and promotions and the slow accumulation of conventional achievement.

None of which answered the question pulsing beneath her ribs.

She thought of Ka dying in the cave, hands full of meat he could not eat. The desperate hunger that had survived the death of the body. The pattern carrying forward, seeking conditions, finding Chandra and his ledgers and his careful calculations of other people's suffering.

*Such a long way to go,* she had thought, watching Ka die. *Hundreds of lifetimes, maybe.*

Had those lifetimes passed? Was the pattern still working at its lesson, still learning the giving that Ka had failed to learn? Was it here, now, in Manchester or elsewhere, walking through a world that had no name for what it was?

The question felt dangerous. She said the word aloud, tasting its weight: "Dangerous."

Not threatening, exactly. Not the danger of violence or discovery. Something else. The danger of knowing too much. The danger of looking and finding. The danger of following a thread to its end and learning what waited there.

She stood, stretching muscles that had stiffened during the long hours of stillness. Her reflection ghosted across the dark window: pale face, dark hair, the body she had worn for twenty-five years and would wear until it failed. Behind the reflection, the city's lights smeared through rain, a world of patterns she had never tried to see.

*I'll follow this one forward,* she decided. The decision felt inevitable, the way certain clinical interventions felt inevitable—not forced but discovered, the right action emerging from the correct assessment. *See where it goes. Understand what it's becoming.*

Not tonight. Tonight she would sleep, eat, recover from the strain of tracking. But tomorrow, or the next day, or the week after—she would return to the thread. Find where Chandra led. Follow the pattern through its subsequent iterations until she found its current address.

A fellow traveler. That was all. Curiosity about a parallel journey. The scientist's desire to understand a phenomenon she had stumbled upon.

*That was all.*

The phrase felt thin even as she thought it. There was more beneath, something she was not ready to examine—a pull that went beyond curiosity, a resonance she could not name. But naming could wait. Understanding could wait. Tonight, she had proven a technique. Tomorrow, she would begin to use it.

Lilith turned off the lamp and let the darkness settle. Outside, the rain continued its patient work, running down windows and gutters and streets toward whatever destination awaited. Inside, something had shifted—some door opened that would not close again, some capacity awakened that demanded to be used.

She did not sleep for a long time. When she finally did, she dreamed of threads—countless threads, crossing and recrossing in patterns too complex to hold, and one thread brighter than the others, pulling her forward into something she could not yet see.
