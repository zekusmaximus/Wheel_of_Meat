# Chapter 3 Scaffold: The Discovery

**Status:** Ready for drafting
**Target:** ~3,000 words (2,500-3,500 range)
**Architecture:** Integrated prose technique throughout
**Timeline:** Days 1-3 of tracking period
**Lilith's Age:** 34

---

## Architectural Requirements

### Integration Technique (Prehistoric/Ka Flavor)
- **Primal, sensory, non-verbal, body-knowledge**
- Manchester leads with observed environment, clinical distance
- Historical bleeds as felt body, animal awareness, pre-linguistic knowing
- When in historical mode: reduce abstractions, more body sensation, less analysis
- Ka doesn't think in words; his experience arrives as physical knowledge

### Sensory Bridges (from lilith-chapter-manifest.json)
1. **Kettle scream / wind scream** — Sound bridge, opening
2. **Tea warmth / fire warmth** — Temperature bridge
3. **Flat silence / cave silence** — Acoustic bridge
4. **Color blooming (tea leaves) / blood blooming (snow)** — Visual bridge

### Parallel Structure
| Ka's Mistake | Lilith's Mistake |
|--------------|------------------|
| Hoarding meat | Hoarding capability |
| Choosing isolation over tribe | Choosing solitary tracking over connection |
| Calling alone-way "strength" | Calling isolation "strategic" |
| Ice wall in chest | Something similar growing in hers |

### Fetter Beat
**Manifestation:** "I've found a problem to solve"
**Emotional State:** Analytical curiosity, first unnamed stirring
**Shown Through:** Action—stays in flat, drinks cold tea, continues tracking
**The Blind Spot:** Cannot see her own grasping

### Maitreya Foreshadowing
- "'We are the same'—horror indistinguishable from fascination"
- Brief perceptual bleed (losing track of which consciousness is which)
- The recognition filed with interest, not alarm

### Pivotal Moment
- **Dominant timeline:** Historical (Ka's death)
- **Technique:** Historical foreground, Manchester recedes to body-echo
- **Content:** Ka dying with frozen meat, desperate hunger to understand giving

## Chapter 2 Integration Points

Key moments from Ka's chapter that Lilith witnesses/integrates with:

### Early Ka (can be referenced)
- Ka waking with blood taste, body knowing bad coming
- Ka sleeping alone near cave mouth while tribe sleeps in pile
- "Something in Ka's chest. Like ice wall."
- Ka watching dog pack hunt together—"like one big animal"
- "Ka hates new way... Fear crawls on Ka's skin."

### Middle Ka (key integration)
- Ka's isolation: "Tribe noise gone on wind... Ka alone. Good."
- Ka being attacked by big cat, tribe saving him
- Ka's moment of learning together-hunting
- "Warm spreads in Ka's chest. Not like fire. Like sun."

### Late Ka—HOARDING (critical for parallel)
- "Something new grows in Ka. Tight chest feeling... Want-to-keep feeling."
- Ka sleeping near meat pile, guarding like mother guards cubs
- Ka making throat-warning sounds when young hunters ask for meat
- "Ka eats alone. Away from tribe-eyes. Hides bones."

### Ka's Death (pivotal scene)
- Ka taking deer, walking into white-storm alone
- "Storm eats Ka... Cave gives no help now."
- "Meat turns hard as stone. Like Ka's black fingers."
- The realization: "Everything in world knows sharing way except Ka."
- Final hunger: "Burning need to know giving... Spreads through Ka's cold body like dawn spreads across sky."
- "Last thought Ka thinks is giving thought."

## Scene Structure

### Section I: The Thread (~800 words)

**Opening:** Dual sensory anchor establishing both timelines in first paragraph.

**Sample opening (from test scene):**
> The kettle screamed and the wind screamed, steam rising from the spout as white-ground fell soft against the cave mouth three hundred thousand years before. Lilith reached for the handle—fingers closing around plastic warmth, around the smooth cold of a bone-knife hilt—and poured water over leaves that would not exist for epochs, watching them bloom into color the way blood bloomed in snow when prey fell wrong.

**Content:**
- Lilith in her Fallowfield flat, late night/early morning
- The practice she has never named—reaching for patterns
- Discovery of Ka's thread: ancient, rough, dense, different from her own iterations
- First sense of his pattern—someone else doing this work
- Integration with Ka's early experience: the isolation, the ice wall
- Her capacity to perceive: full cosmic awareness (not observation-only)

**Parallel seed:** Her isolation in the flat mirrors his isolation from tribe. Both choosing to be apart. Both calling it something other than what it is.

**Technical notes:**
- Establish integration technique immediately
- Use sensory bridges: kettle/wind, warmth/cold
- Keep Ka's language primal when his experience bleeds through
- Her voice: clinical precision undermined by physical tells

---

### Section II: Watching Ka (~1,200 words)

**Function:** Deep integration with Ka's arc. The parallel mistake becomes visible to readers.

**Key beats to integrate from Chapter 2:**

1. **Ka's relationship with tribe:**
   - Sleeping alone at cave mouth while others pile together
   - Watching the dog pack's together-hunting with fear and fascination
   - The ice wall in his chest

2. **Ka's backslide into hoarding:**
   - The "want-to-keep feeling" growing
   - Hiding meat from tribe, eating alone
   - Making threat sounds when cubs ask for food
   - "Mine. Mine. Mine."

3. **The parallel made visible:**
   > Ka was calculating how long this flesh would last if eaten slowly, if hidden from others who might smell it, if the alone-way proved stronger than the together-way.
   >
   > Lilith's tea had gone cold. She drank it anyway, the bitterness appropriate, while Ka gnawed on meat that was beginning to turn, and both of them sat in their caves—hers heated by radiator, his by embers that would gutter before dawn—and chose to stay.

**Fetter beat appears here:**
- She recognizes the pattern, finds it fascinating
- "A problem to solve"—analytical frame
- The first stirring of something she won't name
- She tells herself it's research, clinical interest
- The words are comfortable. The words are wrong.

**Maitreya foreshadowing (subtle):**
- Brief moment of perceptual bleed
- For an instant, not sure if the meat is frozen or the tea is cold
- Filed under fatigue, dismissed, not examined

**Technical notes:**
- Alternate which timeline leads paragraph by paragraph
- Ka's experience in primal, body-knowledge language
- Her observations in clinical vocabulary that doesn't quite fit
- The juxtaposition shows the parallel she can't see

---

### Section III: Ka's Death (~600 words)

**Mode:** Historical-dominant. Manchester reduced to body-echo, peripheral sensation.

**Content from Chapter 2 to render:**
- Ka walking into the white-storm with hoarded deer
- The cold taking everything: meat frozen, fingers blackening
- Tribe's fires visible in distance—the warmth he refused
- The realization: "Everything in world knows sharing way except Ka"
- The hunger transforming: not for meat anymore, but for understanding
- "Burning need to know giving"
- Ka's death carrying the hunger forward

**Sample approach:**
> Ka's last meat feeds small-quick-scratchers. Ka's last warm feeds wind. Ka's last breath feeds air.
>
> Lilith felt each feeding as a loosening in her own chest—not grief, not exactly, but something adjacent: the sensation of watching a fire burn down to embers while the cold pressed closer.
>
> Ka's last thoughts feed time-to-come.

**The Maitreya moment (strongest in chapter):**
> *We are the same,* she thought, and the thought horrified her, and the horror was indistinguishable from fascination.

**Technical notes:**
- Reduce Manchester to 1-2 clauses per paragraph
- Ka's death in his primal language
- Her response in body sensation, not analysis
- The thread pulsing with his hunger—she feels it
- She recognizes something but files it under "interesting"

---

### Section IV: Following Forward (~400 words)

**Mode:** Return to integration, Manchester leading slightly.

**Content:**
- The thread doesn't end—she can follow it forward
- Brief sense of Chandra (warmth, structure, India)
- The pattern continuing, seeking conditions, finding new flesh
- Her decision: she will track this further
- "A fellow traveler"—the phrase that will haunt her

**Closing beat:**
- Morning light beginning (Manchester)
- Both timelines present in final paragraph
- Seeds the next chapter without over-explaining
- Her certainty that this is research, curiosity, professional interest
- The reader sees what she cannot: this is the beginning of obsession

**Sample closing:**
> Morning would come to both of them. Ka's pattern would find new conditions, new flesh, new opportunity to learn what he had failed to learn in dying. Lilith would make tea and teach seminars and document her findings in the careful handwriting that had served her for fifteen years.
>
> But something had shifted. Some door opened that would not close again. Some capacity awakened that demanded to be used.
>
> She called it curiosity. She called it research. She called it anything except what it was becoming.
>
> The wheel turned. Neither of them knew they were already caught.

## Alignment with Chapter 2

### What NOT to change in Chapter 2:
- Ka's language/voice (primal, no articles, fragmented)
- Ka's arc (isolation → tribe saves him → together-hunting → backslide → hoarding → death)
- Ka's death scene specifics (frozen meat, tribe fires visible, hunger for giving)
- The thread continuing to Chandra

### Integration points verified:
- Ka's isolation at cave mouth ✓
- Ice wall metaphor ✓
- Dog pack watching scene ✓
- Hoarding meat sequence ✓
- "Mine. Mine. Mine." ✓
- Death in white-storm ✓
- Final hunger for understanding giving ✓

### Lilith's witnessing:
She doesn't see ALL of Ka's life—she accesses the thread and experiences key moments. Focus on:
1. His isolation (early)
2. His hoarding (middle)
3. His death (climax)

The tribe-saves-Ka sequence and together-hunting can be referenced but aren't the focus—the PARALLEL MISTAKE is the focus, and that's his hoarding/isolation.
