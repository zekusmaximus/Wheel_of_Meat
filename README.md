# The Wheel of Meat

*A literary novel following one soul's journey toward enlightenment across twenty-six chapters and countless lifetimes, spanning 300,000 years from prehistoric Morocco to transcendent realms beyond time.*

---

## Premise

Silas Pahlavan, a philosophy professor in contemporary Manchester, is approaching stream-entry—the first stage of Buddhist enlightenment. Lilith Azami, a near-enlightened psychiatrist with cosmic-scale capability, can see his past lives and is determined to stop his progress. She believes that if only one soul can achieve Buddhahood in this cosmic cycle, it should be her.

As Silas's accumulated incarnations unfold backward through time, Lilith's attachment intensifies in the contemporary timeline—her fetter crystallizing harder with each failed intervention—building toward a confrontation that will determine whether enlightenment—or something stranger—awaits them both.

## Thematic Core

- **The Wheel**: Samsara as literal mechanism—the soul caught in cycles of birth, death, and rebirth
- **The Meat**: Embodiment as both prison and teacher—the physical body as site of suffering and wisdom
- **The Backfire**: Every intervention Lilith makes accelerates Silas's growth rather than impeding it
- **The Kinship**: A growing whisper that pursuer and pursued may be more alike than either knows

## Structure

**26 chapters across 4 acts:**

| Act | Chapters | Content | Focus |
|-----|----------|---------|-------|
| **I** | 1 | Contemporary Manchester | Silas & Lilith meet in the present |
| **II** | 2–21 | Alternating structure | 10 historical lives + 10 Lilith pursuit chapters |
| **III** | 22 | Contemporary Manchester | Stream-entry achieved |
| **IV** | 23–26 | Cosmic realms | Post-enlightenment progression |

### Act II: The Alternating Pattern

Act II alternates between Silas's past lives (even chapters) and Lilith's integrated prose chapters (odd chapters), creating parallel forward momentum. Lilith chapters hold Manchester and historical period simultaneously using an **integrated prose technique**—no scene breaks between timelines.

| Historical (Silas) | Lilith (Integrated Prose) |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Ch 2: Ka — Prehistoric hunter | Ch 3: Integrated with Ka (Days 1-3) |
| Ch 4: Chandra — Mauryan accountant | Ch 5: Integrated with Chandra (Week 1-2) |
| Ch 6: Philon — Athenian physician | Ch 7: Integrated with Philon (Week 2-3) |
| Ch 8: Verinus — Roman investigator | Ch 9: Integrated with Verinus (Week 3-4) |
| Ch 10: Macarius — Desert hermit | Ch 11: Integrated with Macarius (Week 4-5) |
| Ch 12: Kaoru — Heian courtier | Ch 13: Integrated with Kaoru (Week 5-6) |
| Ch 14: Diego — Inquisition victim | Ch 15: Integrated with Diego — FULCRUM (Week 6-7) |
| Ch 16: Jean — Renaissance skeptic | Ch 17: Integrated with Jean (Week 7-8) |
| Ch 18: Wei — Taiping rebel | Ch 19: Integrated with Wei (Week 8-9) |
| Ch 20: Jack Malone — Noir detective | Ch 21: The Pivot (Week 9-10) |

Each historical chapter operates in a distinct **genre mode** (survival horror, political thriller, Greek tragedy, mystery, spiritual drama, Gothic romance, etc.) while maintaining thematic and narrative unity. Lilith's chapters compress 8-10 weeks of feverish tracking, with a 6-12 month time-jump between Chapter 21 and Chapter 1.

## Buddhist Framework

The novel tracks progress through the traditional **Ten Fetters** that bind consciousness to rebirth:

1. Identity view → dissolved in Ch 2 (Ka)
2. Doubt → dissolved in Ch 4 (Chandra)
3. Attachment to rites → dissolved in Ch 6 (Philon)
4. Sensual desire → weakened in Ch 8-12
5. Ill will → weakened in Ch 8-12
6. Craving for form realm → dissolved in Act IV
7. Craving for formless realm → dissolved in Act IV
8. Conceit → dissolved in Act IV
9. Restlessness → dissolved in Act IV
10. Ignorance → dissolved in Ch 26

Parallel to fetter dissolution, the soul develops the **Ten Perfections** (*pāramitās*): generosity, virtue, renunciation, wisdom, energy, patience, truthfulness, determination, loving-kindness, and equanimity.

## Current Progress

## Development Workflow

This project uses an **agent-assisted drafting workflow**:

1. **Scaffolding**: Create chapter folder with `period-rules.md`, `avatar-profile.json`, and `chapter-outline.md`
2. **Scene Drafting**: Draft scenes sequentially with verification passes after each
3. **Verification Passes**: 
   - Sensory Audit (5+ senses per scene)
   - Undermining Clause Audit (no unqualified assertions)
   - Forbidden Pattern Scan (no purple prose, clichés, or banned words)
   - Structural Verification (beat coverage, word count)
   - Continuity Check (cross-chapter consistency)
4. **Manifest Update**: Update `scene-manifest.json` and `novel-progress.txt`

## Key Documents for AI Agents
