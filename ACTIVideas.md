# ACTIVideas – Act IV Cosmic Scaffolding

## Scope & Status
- Mode 1 scaffolding deck for Act IV (Chs. 23–26), covering the post–stream-entry arc toward full enlightenment and merger into Maitreya.【F:claude.md†L21-L29】【F:scene-manifest.json†L57-L66】
- Inherits INVIOLABLE craft constraints (no Buddhist terminology in prose; render emotion through physicality; Lilith’s interventions backfire; same face across incarnations).【F:claude.md†L40-L48】

## Canonical Anchors
- Act IV chapters are Cosmic; drafting requires cosmic register familiarity and adherence to genre modulation guidance.【F:reference/style-rules.md†L109-L117】
- Cosmic entry requirements: scene listed in `scene-manifest.json`, previous chapter read, cosmic voice guidelines reviewed; otherwise HALT and remain in Mode 1 scaffolding.【F:agent-protocol.md†L92-L103】
- Body-thread for Act IV: Ch23 absence of body; Ch24 transhuman/engineered bodies; Ch25 alien embodiment; Ch26 final release from body-identification.【F:meta/thematic-echoes.md†L55-L60】
- Fetters map: sensual desire & ill will weaken in Ch23–24 (once-returner trajectory), break in Ch25 (non-returner), remaining five fetters fall in Ch26 (arahantship/merger).【F:meta/soul-constants.json†L66-L115】
- Lilith continuity lock: canonical facial markers; first full manifestation occurs in Chapter 8 (Marcia).【F:meta/decisions.md†L3-L7】

## Drafting Preconditions (Mode 2 Gate)
- Verify Act IV scenes are listed in `scene-manifest.json` and read the previous chapter before drafting.【F:agent-protocol.md†L92-L103】
- Review cosmic voice guidelines (claude/style-rules) prior to any Mode 2 work; remain in Mode 1 scaffolding until all gates are cleared.【F:agent-protocol.md†L92-L103】【F:reference/style-rules.md†L109-L117】【F:claude.md†L76-L103】

## Voice & Register Guardrails
- Cosmic register: abstract, synesthetic, neologism-possible; syntax may flex or fracture.【F:reference/style-rules.md†L109-L117】
- Core voice patterns must persist (undermining clause, sensory anchoring, loaded gestures, environmental metaphor, emotional-through-physical).【F:claude.md†L76-L103】
- Maintain sensory anchoring even for non-human phenomenology; translate novel senses into embodied analogues.【F:claude.md†L76-L103】

## Time × Realm × Fetters × Dharma × Body Thread
| Ch | Provisional Title | Time Scale | Realm / Embodiment | Fetters State | Dharma Context | Body/Thematic Expression |
|---:|--------------------|-----------:|--------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| 23 | The Celestial | Atemporal orientation | Non-corporeal perception | Sensual desire & ill will weakened (once-returner trajectory) | Dharma irrelevant to audience | Absence of body【F:meta/thematic-echoes.md†L55-L58】【F:meta/soul-constants.json†L66-L79】 |
| 24 | The Prophet | +2–5k years future | Transhuman/engineered bodies | Sensual desire & ill will still weakened | Counterfeit/sterile Dharma presence | Engineered/mediated flesh【F:meta/thematic-echoes.md†L56-L59】【F:meta/soul-constants.json†L66-L79】 |
| 25 | The Explorer | Aeons / unbounded | Non-human / alien embodiment | Sensual desire & ill will broken (non-returner) | Dharma absent | Strange flesh / alien embodiment【F:meta/thematic-echoes.md†L57-L60】【F:meta/soul-constants.json†L66-L79】 |
| 26 | The Awakened | End-of-cycle reset | New planet, threshold civilization | Higher fetters fall; merger/arahantship | First true turning in new world-system | Final release from body-identification【F:meta/thematic-echoes.md†L58-L60】【F:meta/soul-constants.json†L82-L115】 |

## Continuity Locks & Callbacks
- Preserve Lilith’s canonical facial markers and acknowledge Chapter 8 as first full manifestation when referencing her appearance in Act IV materials.【F:meta/decisions.md†L3-L7】
- Keep Act IV body-thread in sync with `meta/thematic-echoes.md`; adjust that file before altering the expressions summarized here.【F:meta/thematic-echoes.md†L55-L60】

## Open Research Prompts (Mode 1)
1. Dharma decline models: imagery-only survey (True/Semblance/Counterfeit/None analogues) for Chapter 24 context.
2. Pure Abodes phenomenology and non-human sensory palettes to translate into embodied analogues for Chapters 23 & 25.
3. Protocolized “Counterfeit Dharma” case studies to dramatize near-turning failure without sermonizing.
4. World-build levers for Ch26 (planetary constraints, kinship/ritual economy) that enable a sincere question and response without authorship claims.

## Action Queue
- Draft `period-rules.md` scaffolds for Ch24 (transhuman counterfeit Dharma) and Ch26 (new-world threshold civilization) under Mode 1.
- Build phenomenology cards for Ch23/25 (5-sense remap + cognition notes) translating cosmic perception into physical analogues.【F:claude.md†L76-L103】
- Formalize Wheel-Turning beat spec for Ch26; ensure it respects non-authorship and first-turn timing post-merger.【F:scene-manifest.json†L57-L66】
- Update `scene-manifest.json` statuses once scaffolding assets are created to satisfy Mode 2 entry gates.【F:agent-protocol.md†L92-L103】
