# WHEEL OF MEAT — Consolidated Revision Plan

**Manuscript:** Draft 1.13.26
**Based on:** Comparative analysis of Report 1 (Gemini) and Report 2
**Purpose:** High-impact editing roadmap for use with Claude Code

-----

## Revision Overview

This plan synthesizes recommendations from both developmental reports, resolves their conflicts, and organizes work into prioritized tiers. Execute in order. Each task includes specific implementation guidance.

-----

## TIER 1: Structural Repairs (Do First)

These issues affect how readers engage with the manuscript's fundamental architecture.

### 1.1 Plant Sensory Echoes Throughout Chapter 1

**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Source:** Both reports (combined from original 1.1 and 1.2)
**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Problem:** The Ch. 1→2 transition from modern psychological thriller to prehistoric survival narrative is jarring. While the disorientation is intentional, readers need subliminal preparation—not explanation, but resonance. The Act structure already signals a major shift; what's missing is sensory foreshadowing that makes Ka's chapter feel like recognition rather than confusion.

**Implementation:**
- Add 4-5 brief sensory intrusions across Chapter 1, escalating in intensity toward the Stewart rooftop sequence
- Each echo should be 1-3 sentences max, presented as inexplicable sensation Silas dismisses or cannot explain
- Echoes should reference multiple past lives but **the final echo must specifically resonate with Ka's opening**

**Suggested placement and content:**

| Location | Echo | Past Life |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Early chapter (faculty interaction) | Flash of heat, smell of smoke, sensation of something burning | Chandra |
| Mid-chapter (tension with Lilith) | Phantom sound—a child's cry, distant and wrong | Chandra or Philon |
| Stewart crisis begins | Taste of stone dust, weight of confined space | Macarius or Verinus |
| Rooftop, as Silas approaches Stewart | Cold that doesn't match the weather, bone-deep and ancient | Ka |
| Rooftop climax, final echo | **Substantial moment:** Snow. Hunger. The desperate knowledge of something dying alone, muscles failing, the world going white and silent. Silas staggers, catches himself. The sensation passes. He doesn't understand it. But it was *real*. | Ka |

**The final echo is critical.** It should be the longest (3-5 sentences), the most disorienting, and specifically evoke Ka's death: cold, isolation, snow, the body failing. When readers enter Chapter 2 and encounter Ka's primal voice in a frozen landscape, some part of their brain should whisper *I've been here before*. They won't consciously connect it to Silas's rooftop moment, but the resonance will carry them through the voice shift.

**What to avoid:**
- No explanation of what the echoes are
- No Lilith POV or any suggestion she's involved
- No mystical language—these are physical sensations, not visions
- Silas should not dwell on or investigate the echoes; they pass through him

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Minimum 4 sensory echoes planted in Chapter 1
- [ ] Echoes reference at least 3 different past lives
- [ ] Intensity escalates toward rooftop scene
- [ ] Final echo is 3-5 sentences and specifically evokes Ka's death (cold, snow, isolation, body failing)
- [ ] Silas does not understand the echoes—no exposition, no investigation
- [ ] Ka's Chapter 2 opening creates subliminal recognition for readers who experienced the final echo

### 1.2 Establish Lilith's Present-Day Search Arc and Intervention Constraints

**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Source:** Revision of Report 1's "ticking clock" and "magic system" recommendations  
**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Problem:** Lilith's Manchester frame is too passive, and the rules governing her abilities are implied but never clarified. The editors called for a "ticking clock," but physical deterioration contradicts her near-Buddha status (nine fetters broken). They also flagged that her intervention mechanics need clearer rules—can she change history? Why can't she simply locate him in present day? These issues are connected: the constraints on her power explain why she must search, and the search creates the urgency.

**The Integrated Solution:**

Lilith can only interact with a consciousness at *unresolved moments*—choice-points where outcomes remain uncertain, where the historical record is ambiguous or silent. She cannot alter documented facts, only influence decisions that history doesn't definitively record. This is why her interventions target moments of private choice (Devaka's betrayal, the altered testimony) rather than public events.

Crucially: she cannot skip ahead on the thread. To locate a consciousness in the present, she must trace it sequentially through each life, each death, each rebirth. The thread resists shortcuts. This transforms the historical chapters from leisurely observation into obstacles—each life she tracks is another barrier between her and his present-day location.

Her search begins at Chapter 7 when she realizes her interventions are accelerating rather than impeding his progress. At current rate, he will reach enlightenment within one or two more significant lives. She must find him NOW, in present day, and attempt direct contact rather than intervention-at-distance. But she's trapped in the past, forced to follow the thread forward century by century while he exists somewhere in contemporary Manchester, progressing without her.

**Implementation:**

**Chapter 3 (First Tracking Scene):**
- Establish the constraint: she's following his thread but cannot skip ahead
- Show her methodology: reaching into unresolved moments, tracing consciousness through death to rebirth
- Plant the limitation: she cannot interact with documented history, only with private choice-points
- At this stage, she believes she has time; the constraint is noted but not yet frustrating

**Chapter 7 (Pivot Point):**
- After the Philon backfire, Lilith realizes the pattern: opposition accelerates what she opposes
- She calculates that at current rate, he will reach enlightenment soon
- New goal crystallizes: find him NOW, in present day, attempt direct contact
- The constraint she noted in Chapter 3 becomes her prison: she cannot skip ahead
- Her tracking transforms from observation to urgent chase toward present
- Establish that direct contact might work where intervention-at-distance keeps backfiring—she's never tried proximity

**Chapters 8-10 (Search Begins):**
- Manchester interludes add brief search activity alongside tracking: checking university philosophy departments, scanning for signs of unusual spiritual progress
- The dual track emerges: she's tracing his history AND hunting for him in present day, hoping the search succeeds before the tracking catches up
- Keep search additions short (1-2 paragraphs per interlude)
- Frustration mounts: the thread won't let her skip ahead; the search has no thread to follow

**Chapters 11-18 (Search Intensifies):**
- Each historical chapter is another obstacle between her and present day
- Her present-day search narrows: academia, philosophy, possibly Manchester
- Her alarm grows as she witnesses his increasing agency in historical lives (see 2.1)
- The intervention rules constrain her options: she can only press on unresolved moments, and fewer such moments remain as she approaches present day where history is still being written
- Dramatic irony for readers: they met Silas in Ch 1, they know where he is

**Chapter 19 (Convergence):**
- Her historical tracking finally reaches present day
- Her present-day search succeeds simultaneously—thread and hunt arrive at the same destination
- The constraint releases: she no longer needs to trace; she can simply BE where he is
- New strategic territory: direct contact, not intervention-at-distance
- She's found him. Now she must decide what to do differently.

**How the Rules Integrate:**

| Constraint | Story Function |
|------------|----------------|
| Can only influence unresolved moments | Explains why she targets private choices, not public events |
| Cannot change documented history | Closes causality loopholes; her alterations work in historical gaps |
| Cannot skip ahead on thread | Forces sequential tracking; creates the search problem |
| Intervention-at-distance keeps backfiring | Motivates shift to direct contact strategy |

**What to avoid:**
- Info-dump explaining the rules (reveal through her tactical thinking)
- Physical deterioration or weakness (urgency comes from the race, not her body)
- Artificially prolonged search (readers will get frustrated if she's incompetent)
- Overlong search scenes (economical tension-building, not padding)
- Rules that create plot holes (keep constraints consistent throughout)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Chapter 3 establishes she cannot skip ahead on the thread (noted, not yet frustrating)
- [ ] Chapter 3 shows she can only influence unresolved moments/private choices
- [ ] Chapter 7 contains clear pivot: backfires accelerate his progress; she must find him now
- [ ] Chapter 7 makes the constraint her prison: she's trapped in sequential tracking
- [ ] Chapters 8-19 Manchester interludes include brief search activity alongside tracking
- [ ] Search intensity correlates with what she witnesses in historical tracking
- [ ] Intervention rules are demonstrated through her tactical thinking, not exposition
- [ ] Rules remain consistent throughout (no violations or convenient exceptions)
- [ ] Search and tracking converge simultaneously in Chapter 19
- [ ] Reader experiences dramatic irony (they know where Silas is)
- [ ] No physical deterioration—urgency comes from the race and the constraints

## TIER 2: Character & Agency Repairs

These changes affect how readers experience the protagonist's journey.

### 2.1 Give Silas Active Agency in Two Historical Lives (Plot-Integrated)

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Source:** Report 1, now integrated with Lilith's search arc  
**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Problem:** Silas is too passive. Growth happens only at death. Readers never see him apply accumulated wisdom within a life. Additionally, Lilith's search arc needs plot-level triggers that escalate her urgency.

**Solution:** Silas's agency moments serve double duty—they satisfy the reader's need to see him "fight back" AND they function as alarm bells for Lilith, who witnesses them while tracking. His unexpected choices are evidence that he's accelerating toward enlightenment, intensifying her search.

**Implementation:**

Select two later incarnations where accumulated soul-wisdom allows Silas to make choices that surprise Lilith. These moments should occur in lives she's tracking AFTER her search begins (post-Chapter 7), so her reaction can drive the search escalation.

**Jean de Langon (recommended: Chapter 11-14 range):**

*What Silas does:*
- He senses something wrong about the Ségurian investigation—not rationally, but through a "deeper knowing"
- He chooses to submit an honest, inconclusive report despite the cost to his career and safety
- Interior moment: inexplicable certainty that falsifying findings would be worse than any consequence
- He does not understand why he knows this; it simply feels like remembering something he never learned

*What Lilith witnesses:*
- She expected him to compromise (her intervention was designed to force a corrupting choice)
- Instead, he accesses wisdom that took previous lives to accumulate—and accesses it MID-LIFE, not at death
- Her Manchester reaction (1-2 paragraphs): alarm, recalculation, search intensifies
- Interior thought: *He's drawing on accumulated learning earlier than any previous incarnation. He's not just progressing—he's accelerating.*

**Jack Malone (recommended: Chapter 15-18 range):**

*What Silas does:*
- He recognizes the woman (Lilith's avatar) as somehow familiar—her eyes, her manner, something he can't name
- He makes a choice that defies her orchestration: refuses to take a case, walks away from the trap she's set, or acts against his apparent self-interest
- Interior moment: "He'd seen those eyes before. He couldn't say where. But he knew not to trust them."
- Again, he doesn't understand the source of this knowing

*What Lilith witnesses:*
- He's not just resisting her intervention—he's recognizing HER across incarnations
- This has never happened before. The veil between lives is thinning for him.
- Her Manchester reaction: near-panic, search becomes desperate
- Interior thought: *He's approaching threshold. The accumulated lives are bleeding through. I'm out of time.*

**Structural placement:**
- Jean de Langon agency → triggers search intensification in subsequent Manchester interlude
- Jack Malone agency → triggers final desperate push; she's close to finding him

**What to avoid:**
- Silas consciously understanding reincarnation (he acts on instinct, not knowledge)
- Agency that undermines the death-lesson structure (he still dies; the agency is mid-life, not salvation)
- Lilith's alarm feeling disconnected from what she witnesses (her escalation must be direct response)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Jean de Langon chapter includes soul-memory choice
- [ ] Jean de Langon choice triggers visible alarm in Lilith's next Manchester scene
- [ ] Jack Malone chapter includes soul-memory recognition of Lilith
- [ ] Jack Malone recognition triggers desperate escalation in her search
- [ ] Neither choice requires Silas to consciously understand reincarnation
- [ ] Both choices surprise/frustrate Lilith AND advance her search urgency
- [ ] Silas's agency and Lilith's search feel like integrated plot, not separate threads

---

### 2.2 Deepen Lilith's Motivation Through Action

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Source:** Report 2, restructured to integrate with search arc  
**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Problem:** Lilith's stated fear—"Couldn't let you go somewhere I can't follow"—needs visceral grounding. Report 2 recommended adding reflection or memory to explain her terror. However, with the search arc now in place, the revision approach shifts: her motivation should be DEMONSTRATED through action rather than STATED through reflection.

**Implementation:**

The search arc itself becomes the primary vehicle for revealing Lilith's motivation. Her increasingly desperate pursuit shows readers what she fears without requiring explicit interiority. However, strategic moments of vulnerability—brief, earned, never sentimental—can deepen the portrait.

**Show motivation through search behavior:**
- The intensity of her hunt demonstrates the stakes without explanation
- Her frustration at being trapped in historical tracking while he exists NOW reveals how much this matters
- Her alarm at his agency (2.1) shows she's not just racing—she's terrified of losing

**Add ONE moment of vulnerability (Chapter 7 pivot or shortly after):**
- When she realizes backfires accelerate his progress, allow a brief crack in her clinical armor
- Not a full reflection scene—a flash, quickly suppressed
- Options:
  - A single paragraph recalling what eternity felt like before she found his thread (isolation as lived experience, not concept)
  - A physical sensation—the specific texture of being alone in a way humans cannot understand
  - A thought that surfaces before she can stop it: the recognition that his enlightenment means his annihilation-from-her, not transcendence-with-her
- She suppresses it. Files it. Returns to strategy. But readers saw it.

**Let the search REPLACE extended motivation scenes:**
- The original plan called for showing "what eternity alone would mean to her"
- The search arc shows this through action: she's willing to spend weeks/months tracking through history, searching present-day Manchester, hunting with increasing desperation
- Her behavior IS the revelation. Actions over words.

**Strategic placement of vulnerability:**
- Chapter 7 (pivot): one moment of exposed fear, immediately suppressed
- Chapter 11-14 (post-Jean de Langon): perhaps a second flash when she sees him accessing accumulated wisdom
- No more than 2-3 brief moments total—preserve her clinical exterior

**What to avoid:**
- Extended reflection scenes (she's not introspective about her fear; she acts on it)
- Sentimentality or softening (her fear manifests as intensity, not sadness)
- Over-explaining (readers should feel her terror, not have it analyzed for them)
- Front-loading motivation (let it emerge through the search arc, not precede it)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Search arc behavior demonstrates motivation without explicit statement
- [ ] Maximum 2-3 brief vulnerability moments across Chapters 7-19
- [ ] Each vulnerability moment is quickly suppressed (she doesn't dwell)
- [ ] Readers understand her terror through action before any explicit confirmation
- [ ] Clinical exterior remains intact—cracks visible but armor holds
- [ ] No sentimentality; fear manifests as intensity and desperation
- [ ] By Chapter 19, readers fully understand the stakes without having been told directly

### 2.3 Sharpen the Failure-to-Lesson Pipeline

**Priority:** HIGH
**Source:** Report 2
**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Problem:** The overcorrection cycle is brilliant but could be more explicit. Each incarnation's flaw should clearly stem from the previous death's trauma.

**Implementation:**

- Dedicated revision pass through each life transition
- Add brief interior moments where each incarnation experiences inexplicable aversion to the previous failure mode:

|Life   |Core Flaw                            |Should Explicitly React Against           |
|-------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
|Chandra|Obsession with impersonal systems    |Chaotic personal violence (Ka's world)    |
|Philon |Desperate focus on saving individuals|Failure to see "faces" (Chandra's ledgers)|
|Silas  |Helper identity as attachment        |Martyrdom that saved no one (Philon)      |

- Examples:
  - Chandra feels inexplicable revulsion at disorder, chaos, personal conflict
  - Philon cannot look at spreadsheets without nausea
  - Silas flinches from self-sacrifice rhetoric

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Each major incarnation has explicit reaction to previous failure
- [ ] Reactions are shown as inexplicable aversions, not conscious knowledge
- [ ] Pipeline creates sense of single continuous arc, not separate lessons

-----

## TIER 3: Pacing & Voice Repairs

These changes address reading experience and narrative rhythm.

### 3.1 Add One Successful Intervention That Produces Horror

**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Source:** Report 1's "break the formula" recommendation, refined  
**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Problem:** Even with Lilith's search arc (1.2) and Silas's agency moments (2.1), the core historical rhythm persists: intervene → backfire → death-lesson. Readers need one outcome that breaks this pattern completely. The Tier 1-2 changes add variety in *her* activity and *his* resistance, but don't vary the *outcome* of intervention itself.

**Solution:** One incarnation (Chapter 8-10 range) where Lilith's intervention succeeds exactly as intended—and the success is more disturbing than any backfire. This completes the outcome spectrum and deepens her arc by revealing what she actually wants, and why getting it is its own punishment.

**Placement Logic:**

| Chapter Range | What Happens |
|---------------|--------------|
| 7 | Pivot: she realizes backfires accelerate him |
| **8-10** | **Success-horror: she wins, and winning is terrible** |
| 11-14 | Jean de Langon: he exercises agency, surprises her |
| 15-18 | Jack Malone: he recognizes her, defies her |

This sequence creates mounting collapse: her old strategy fails (backfires), her adjusted strategy fails worse (success-horror), and then he starts fighting back (agency). By Chapter 15+, she's losing on every front.

**Implementation:**

Select one incarnation in the Chapter 8-10 range. The intervention should achieve her stated goal—impeding his progress—and produce one of these horror outcomes:

**Option A: The Hollow Victory**
- She successfully prevents the death-lesson. He dies bitter, regressed, having learned nothing.
- The life simply... ends. No crystallizing insight. No hunger carried forward. Just cessation.
- Watching this produces unexpected anguish in her. The absence of his progress feels like absence of *him*.
- She realizes she's been feeding on the very thing she's fighting—his growth is what makes him HIM.
- Horror: she doesn't want to stop him. She wants to beat him. Those aren't the same thing.

**Option B: The Mirror**
- She successfully shapes him toward her own approach—strategic, calculating, treating enlightenment as something to be won.
- For one life, he becomes like her. Grasping. Competing. Trying to optimize his way to liberation.
- Watching herself reflected in him is repulsive. The thing she's trying to create is the thing she hates.
- He dies having "progressed" by her metrics but something essential is missing—the quality that makes his thread worth following.
- Horror: if she wins, she loses what she was racing toward.

**Option C: The Fracture**
- She intervenes too forcefully. His consciousness doesn't progress OR regress—it dims. Fragments.
- For several subsequent incarnations (glimpsed briefly), the thread is weak, hard to follow, nearly lost.
- She experiences genuine terror: she almost destroyed him entirely.
- The thread eventually reconstitutes, but she's shaken. There are limits to what she can do without losing him.
- Horror: her power over him is also power to annihilate what she needs.

**Recommendation:** Option B (The Mirror) integrates most cleanly with her remaining fetter (attachment to winning). Seeing him become a competitor—and finding that repulsive—exposes what she actually values about him, which isn't his defeat.

**Incarnation Selection:**

Choose a life where "becoming strategic/calculating" would be a plausible corruption:
- Verinus (Roman investigator): already procedural; could become politically calculating, abandon truth for advancement
- Macarius (desert ascetic): could become spiritually competitive, treating enlightenment as achievement
- Another figure whose integrity could be corrupted toward gamesmanship

**What to show:**
- The intervention working. No backfire. She gets what she designed.
- Her initial satisfaction: *Finally. This time it worked.*
- The gradual horror as she watches the result
- A visceral recoil she doesn't fully understand
- Brief Manchester aftermath: she doesn't try this approach again. Back to opposition. But something has shifted—she's seen what she doesn't want.

**What to avoid:**
- Extended philosophical explanation of why this is horrible (show her recoil, don't analyze it)
- Making the incarnation feel like filler (it should be a complete, affecting life even without the meta-horror)
- Undermining subsequent backfires (her return to opposition should feel like retreat, not ignorance)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] One incarnation in Ch 8-10 range where intervention succeeds as designed
- [ ] Success produces horror rather than satisfaction
- [ ] Horror reveals something about what Lilith actually wants/values
- [ ] She recoils from the success without fully understanding why
- [ ] Incarnation works as complete narrative even without meta-level (readers who miss the implication still get a good chapter)
- [ ] Subsequent interventions feel like retreat to familiar failure rather than repeating the success
- [ ] Placement before Jean de Langon creates escalating collapse: success-horror → he fights back → she's losing everything

-----

### 3.2 Expand the Silex/Lith Future Chapter

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Source:** Report 1
**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Problem:** The Eternal Synthesis section reads as philosophical summary, not lived experience. Needs the same sensory density as historical chapters.

**Implementation:**

- Add specific sensory detail showing what sterile perfection feels like:
  - The exact temperature of optimized air (always 21.3°C, never varying)
  - The engineered satisfaction of nutrient consumption (perfect, identical, empty)
  - The hollow quality of designed connection
  - The absence of randomness, surprise, genuine discomfort
- Show why this "paradise" is wrong through sensation, not explanation
- The wrongness should be felt in the body before understood by the mind

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Minimum 5 specific sensory details added
- [ ] Reader feels the oppression of perfection
- [ ] Chapter length approaches density of historical chapters
- [ ] Philosophy emerges from experience, not vice versa

-----

### 3.3 Add Clear POV Transition Markers

**Priority:** LOW
**Source:** Report 1
**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Problem:** Shifts from historical avatar's limited POV to Lilith's Manchester observation can feel abrupt. (Note: This is not head-hopping—POV discipline is maintained—but transitions need clearer signaling.)

**Implementation:**

- Establish consistent visual marker for POV shifts:
  - Option: Centered `* * *` between sections
  - Option: Blank line with `—` centered
  - Option: Different typography (though this complicates production)
- Apply consistently throughout manuscript
- Consider adding brief "return to Manchester" phrase after marker: "In her flat, Lilith opened her eyes."

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Consistent marker chosen and applied
- [ ] Every POV shift uses the marker
- [ ] Reader always knows whose consciousness they're inhabiting

-----

### 3.4 Revise "The Teaching" Chapter

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Source:** Report 1
**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Problem:** The merged entity's message to villagers reads as sermon. Philosophy is stated, not demonstrated.

**Implementation:**

- Cut or drastically reduce philosophical speech
- Replace with scene where entity performs an act of profound connection:
  - Option: Entity sits with dying elder and simply stays—entire lesson embodied in one wordless gesture
  - Option: Entity does something impossibly simple that the villagers have been unable to do
  - Option: Entity demonstrates "staying" by refusing to leave, teach, or improve—just being present
- Let reader extrapolate the teaching from the action
- Final line should be image, not statement

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Philosophical speech reduced by minimum 50%
- [ ] Central act demonstrates rather than explains
- [ ] Reader understands teaching without being told
- [ ] Ending lands on action/image, not declaration

-----

## TIER 4: Polish & Cleanup

Address after structural and character work is complete.

### 4.1 Fix Encoding Errors

**Priority:** LOW
**Source:** Neither report (identified in manuscript review)
**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Problem:** Manuscript contains corrupted characters—garbled smart quotes, em-dashes rendering as `â€"`, `â€™`, etc.

**Implementation:**

- Systematic find-replace pass:
  - `â€"` → `—` (em-dash)
  - `â€™` → `'` (right single quote/apostrophe)
  - `â€œ` → `"` (left double quote)
  - `â€` → `"` (right double quote)
  - Other mojibake patterns as found
- Verify encoding is UTF-8 throughout
- Check for any remaining non-rendering characters

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] No corrupted characters remain
- [ ] All quotes and dashes render correctly
- [ ] File encoding verified as UTF-8

-----

### 4.2 Audit Chapter Lengths

**Priority:** LOW
**Source:** Neither report
**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Problem:** Some historical lives may feel rushed relative to others. No systematic length analysis has been done.

**Implementation:**

- Create word count table for all chapters
- Identify outliers (significantly shorter than average)
- For each short chapter, determine:
  - Does brevity serve the story? (Some lives should be brief)
  - Does brevity feel rushed? (Needs expansion)
- Expand where necessary to match density of stronger chapters

**Target:** No historical life chapter should be less than 60% of the average length unless brevity is deliberate and effective.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Word count table completed
- [ ] Outliers identified and evaluated
- [ ] Rushed chapters expanded or brevity justified
- [ ] Pacing feels intentional throughout

-----

### 4.3 Title Decision

**Priority:** LOW
**Source:** Neither report
**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Problem:** "Wheel of Meat" is memorable but potentially alienating. "The Ten Fetters of the Boundless Thread" is accurate but cumbersome.

**Options to consider:**

- "The Boundless Thread" (retains central metaphor, cleaner)
- "Wheel of Meat" (keep if beta readers respond strongly)
- New title capturing both visceral image and transcendence arc
- Test options with beta readers before final selection

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Minimum 3 title options developed
- [ ] Options tested with beta readers
- [ ] Final title selected based on response data
