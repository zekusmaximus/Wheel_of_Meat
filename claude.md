## Project Overview

A literary novel following one soul's journey toward enlightenment across sixteen lifetimes, spanning 300,000 years. Each chapter operates in a distinct historical period and genre (survival horror, political thriller, noir, cosmic fantasy, etc.) while maintaining unified voice patterns and thematic throughlines.

**Core Premise:** Philosophy professor Silas Pahlavan approaches stream-entry while psychiatrist Lilith Azami—a rival bodhisattva who appears with the same face across all his past lives—attempts to derail his progress. Her interventions always backfire, becoming the friction that forges his growth. They ultimately merge to become Maitreya, the future Buddha. The competition was illusory; they were always two aspects of the same being.

**Structure:** 16 chapters in 4 acts:
- Act 1 (Ch 1): Contemporary Manchester—introduction
- Act 2 (Ch 2-11): Ten historical lives—developing perfections
- Act 3 (Ch 12): Contemporary Manchester—stream-entry
- Act 4 (Ch 13-16): Post-stream-entry realms—full enlightenment

## Constraint Hierarchy

### INVIOLABLE (Breaking these ruins the novel)

1. **No Buddhist terminology in prose** — Never use dharma, karma, samsara, nirvana, enlightenment, attachment, suffering, awakening, meditation, mindfulness. Show through experience; reader infers meaning. *Exception: historical accuracy (Ashoka's edicts may reference "Dhamma").*

2. **No abstract emotion words** — Never write afraid, angry, sad, happy, anxious, nervous, excited, worried, relieved, frustrated, confused, surprised, lonely, guilty, ashamed, proud, jealous, hopeful, desperate. Render all internal states through physical sensation, action, or environment.

3. **Lilith's interventions always backfire** — Every attempt to derail Silas becomes the catalyst for his growth. No exceptions. She is not his enemy; she is his necessary other half.

4. **Death scenes must include karmic bridge** — The final clinging-thought shapes the next life. Extended, visceral, with clear connection to next chapter's lesson.

5. **Voice patterns persist across all genres** — The undermining clause, sensory anchoring, loaded gestures, environmental metaphor, and parallel construction adapt their METHOD by period but their FUNCTION never disappears.

6. **They become Maitreya** — The ending recontextualizes everything. Foreshadow throughout: moments where duality collapses, times when harming him causes her inexplicable pain.

7. **Same face across all incarnations** — Lilith appears as the same dark-haired woman in every life. Readers recognize her before avatars do.

### HIGH-PRIORITY (Confirm with author if uncertain)

- All five senses present in every scene
- Recognition markers (once defined) in every chapter
- Genre conventions honored while maintaining voice
- Lilith's power level matches chapter (see `lilith-arc.json`)
- Sensory anchor opens every scene (environment before interiority)
- Meat/body theme present in every chapter

### PREFERENCES (Apply when consistent with scene)

- Specific sensory palette per setting (develop before drafting)
- Dialogue tags omitted when action makes speaker clear
- Deliberate fragments in pairs/triads for emphasis
- Environmental metaphor mirrors or contrasts emotional state
- Parallel construction for philosophical content

## The Voice

This novel has a distinctive prose style. The FUNCTION of each pattern persists; the METHOD adapts by period.

### Core Patterns

**1. The Undermining Clause**
Every assertion gets complicated by a second element. Surface acknowledged, then contradicted or darkened.
- Contemporary: "A gesture that seemed both innocent and calculated."
- Prehistoric: "Ka strong. Ka good hunter. But hunters, different."
- Formal ancient: Aphoristic reversal
- Cosmic: Paradox/koan structure

**2. Sensory Anchoring**
Physical reality before interiority. Open scenes with environment or body sensation. No floating heads, no ungrounded dialogue.
- Contemporary: Observed environment
- Prehistoric: Felt body
- Formal ancient: Ritual/material culture
- Cosmic: Synesthetic flooding

**3. Loaded Gestures**
Physical actions carry psychological/spiritual meaning. Small movements encode what characters cannot say.

**4. Environmental Metaphor**
Setting reflects emotional/spiritual state. Weather, light, space mirror interior conditions. In prehistoric chapters, self and world are unified.

**5. Parallel Construction**
Mirrored phrases for thematic content. Used to contrast states, embed philosophy, create incantatory rhythm in spiritual moments.

**6. Emotional Through Physical**
All internal states rendered through body sensation, action, or environment. The forbidden emotion words list exists because this rule is non-negotiable.

### Forbidden Patterns

1. **Filter verbs without purpose** — "he saw," "she felt," "he noticed," "she realized" distance reader from experience
2. **Unearned interiority** — Thoughts are brief, observed; no pages of internal monologue
3. **Dialogue without action** — Speech is embodied; every exchange needs physical grounding
4. **Setting without meaning** — Every environmental detail carries weight
5. **Single-register dialogue** — Characters shift speech by context and power dynamics
6. **Simple statements** — Complicate with second clause or observation
7. **Abstract emotion words** — See INVIOLABLE constraints
8. **Buddhist terminology** — See INVIOLABLE constraints
9. **Exposition dumps** — Information emerges through action and sensory detail
10. **On-the-nose dialogue** — Subtext over text; what's unsaid matters
11. **Explaining the theme** — Trust the reader
12. **Modern anachronisms** — Research each period thoroughly (objects, concepts, attitudes, vocabulary)
13. **Head-hopping within scenes** — One POV per scene; switch only at clear breaks
14. **Generic descriptions** — "Beautiful," "strange," "interesting" are empty; specify
15. **Consequence-free violence** — Injuries and deaths matter; show the cost

See `reference/style-rules.md` for the complete list with examples and physical manifestation reference tables.

### Genre Adaptation

| Period | Vocabulary | Undermining Method | Anchoring Method |
|--------|------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Prehistoric (Ch 2) | Concrete nouns, sensory verbs, no abstractions | Paratactic contradiction | Body sensation |
| Ancient/Classical (Ch 3-6) | Period-appropriate, not archaic pastiche | Aphoristic reversal | Ritual/material culture |
| Medieval/Early Modern (Ch 7-9) | Genre-colored formality | Genre-appropriate twist | Genre atmosphere |
| Modern (Ch 10-11) | Genre-specific (War = expansive; Noir = clipped) | Genre-appropriate twist | Genre atmosphere |
| Cosmic (Ch 13-16) | Abstract, synesthetic, neologism-possible | Paradox/koan structure | Synesthetic flooding |

## The Two Protagonists

### Silas / The Soul

One consciousness across sixteen lives, working toward enlightenment. No memory crosses between lives; continuity is causal, not substantial.

**Core Flaw:** Compulsive helping—attachment to being the one who fixes, saves, guides others. This manifests differently in each life but is always present. The helper identity reinforces the sense of separate self, which is the actual obstacle.

**Recognition Markers** (for reader continuity; characters don't recognize themselves):
- Patience and observation ("Ka watches. Learns." → Silas's academic temperament)
- [Physical marker TBD]
- [Behavioral marker TBD]

**Spiritual Progression:**
- Chapters 2-11: Developing perfections, maintaining identity-view
- Chapter 12: Stream-entry (breaks first three fetters: self-illusion, doubt, attachment to rites)
- Chapters 13-14: Once-returner progress
- Chapter 15: Non-returner status
- Chapter 16: Full enlightenment / Merger with Lilith

### Lilith

A rival bodhisattva, very close to Buddhahood, who believes only one Buddha can exist per world-system. Her grasping at Buddhahood is itself the attachment that prevents her enlightenment—she cannot see that releasing her claim would free her.

**Key Facts:**
- Same face across all incarnations (dark-haired woman)
- Her interventions ALWAYS backfire—they become the friction that forges his progress
- Power level escalates chapter by chapter (see `lilith-arc.json`)
- Each chapter has a specific objective (documented in `lilith-arc.json`)
- Present-day relationship with Silas: lovers

**Power Constraints** (see `meta/rebirth-mechanics.md` for full mechanics):
- Can observe past lives but cannot change past events
- Can influence circumstances and people, not Silas directly
- Cannot force his choices or negate his accumulated merit
- Her interventions have karmic consequences for herself
- Power grows from observation (Ch 2) → influence (Ch 3-6) → manifestation (Ch 7-11) → full presence (Ch 12) → cosmic scale (Ch 13-16)

**The Resolution:** They merge to become Maitreya, the future Buddha. The "one Buddha per world-system" rule was true but misunderstood—there was only ever one Buddha-to-be, appearing as two until ready to unite.

## Thematic Throughlines

### The Meat/Body Theme
The title refers to the flesh that traps and enables spiritual development. Each chapter manifests this differently—track in `meta/thematic-echoes.md`.

### The Intervention Paradox
Every attempt by Lilith to derail Silas becomes the catalyst for his growth. Opposition is necessary for enlightenment. She is not the enemy of his awakening—she is its unwitting catalyst.

### The One-Buddha Question
Buddhist texts say one Buddha per world-system. This creates the apparent conflict. Resolution: they were always one Buddha-to-be, appearing as two.

### Karmic Bridges
Each death plants the seed for the next life's lesson. The flame metaphor: consciousness transfers like fire between candles—not the same flame, yet not entirely different. See `meta/rebirth-mechanics.md` for mechanics.

### Foreshadowing Maitreya
Plant throughout:
- Maitreya statues, texts, passing mentions
- "Loving-kindness" (the name's meaning) in significant contexts
- Moments where duality collapses
- Times when harming him causes her inexplicable pain
- Dreams or visions where they appear as one being

## Never Improvise (Require Author Approval)

The agent must NOT independently create or modify:

- Reincarnation/rebirth mechanics
- Lilith's powers or constraints beyond what's documented
- Fetter progression or breaking sequence
- New chapters or structural changes
- Recognition markers (until defined by author)
- The Maitreya resolution or how the merger occurs
- Any Buddhist cosmology or metaphysics
- Plot twists not documented in scene-manifest.json
- New characters with cross-chapter significance
- How Silas and Lilith meet in present day
- The mechanism of stream-entry in Chapter 12

If any of these seem necessary for a scene to work, document the need in `novel-progress.txt` and wait for author input.
